Perhaps the work is aimed at children... or just people who don't understand the difference between pirates and sailors. This can result in a strange dissonance where the friendly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">messianic</a> nature of the characters is at odds with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy">openly predatory nature of the professions</a> they claim to engage in.

</li><li> Despite being sent to school in the second episode, as well as numerous arcs that center around school characters or are set in the school, the students of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> don't seem to be doing that much... schoolwork. Sure they are shown sitting down in class and standing outside in the hallway, but it seems they spend way more time with extracurricular activities (like sports) and martial arts than they actually do <em>learning</em> which is common of most stories involving schools.
<ul><li> Speaking of school, how about that Tendo "dojo"? 36 volumes, 0 students.
</li><li> Soun Tendo may qualify as the single biggest waste of flesh in the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> canon (and that's saying a lot). Not only does he have no apparent job or any other source of income (<em>least</em> of all running that "dojo"), he's never shown any evidence that he knows the first thing about raising children or running a household. He rarely ever makes the slightest attempt to solve any of the crises that regularly plague his family, and on the few occasions he grudgingly lifts a finger, he's incredibly incompetent and only makes the situation worse (the flippin' <em>King of Gambling</em> completely owned him, for crying out loud).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has become more and more of this as time has gone on. There do exist pirates who do things like kill, pillage, steal and plunder (mostly the more villainous pirate groups, from Buggy right at the beginning), but most of the main pirates have very little interest in treasure (with some notable exceptions like Nami). Pirates often tend to be more about absolute freedom than anything else, or achieving a particular life dream. Even Luffy's goal, to find the 'ultimate treasure' One Piece, is only because the title of Pirate King means that he has more freedom than anyone on the seas.
<ul><li> Occasionally subverted; as noted, plenty of the main characters are fundamentally kindhearted, to the point that it's easy to forget that they are pirates at all. When any pirate who is not explicitly an antagonist does anything vaguely villainous, they will occasionally say 'well, we are pirates, after all'.
</li><li> Outside of one flashback in an anime filler episode, "Pirate Hunter Zoro" has never been seen actually performing any bounty hunting, since the first time he's seen he's been captured, and he joins Luffy soon after. Even years after he's given up the bounty hunting business and gained more notoriety as Luffy's right-hand man than he ever did as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a>, his moniker is still the same.
<ul><li> Not terribly surprising, as the Straw Hat Pirates do seem to take down a whole lot of other Pirates. If they hadn't explicitly identified themselves as pirates they would probably be some of the most respected bounty hunters on the seas, well except for the fights with Marines. Most of which early on could have been avoided if they hadn't called themselves pirates.
</li><li> The only time the Straw Hats did something that could be called piracy was when they "stole" some gold from Sky Island. However, the inhabitants would have given them even more gold if they had asked, as said inhabitants were very happy that Luffy took down "God" Eneru (the local ruler and arc villain) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">had no desire or use for the gold</a>. In fact, they were more interested in and excited about Usopp's rubber bands (which they don't have on Sky Island) than the gold.
</li></ul></li><li> After the timeskip, generally all of the "good" crews are this, while "bad" crews like the Donquixote Family, Kidd Pirates, and Big Mom Pirates are shown to do more typical pirate things. And even then, some of their criminal activities tend to differ a little from what an actual pirate would do; the Donquixote family is more preoccupied with ruling an island and trafficking artificial devil fruits, and the Four Emperors are less pirates, and more really successful warlords at best, what with having actual empires they rule and even tax in some cases. It does appear in many cases that "pirate" ends up being either an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>, or just an indication that whatever the person is doing is extremely illegal and sort of on the sea.
</li><li> Lampshaded when a third party intervenes during a one-on-one fight, and Luffy's opponent(the beneficiary) apologizes for it not being fair and tries to compensate. Luffy points out that being fair isn't really a pirate thing to begin with and had no qualms with the disadvantage.
</li><li> It certainly helps that <em>One Piece</em> takes place in a world that is almost entirely covered in ocean, and it's ruled by an extremely strict world government that is quick to judge anything they deem a threat. In other words, a "pirate" in the world of <em>One Piece</em> is essentially anyone who has earned the ire of said government.
</li><li> Eariler drafts acknowledged this by having two specifically named types of Pirates. The more tradtional rape, pillage and plunder type "Morganeer" pirates; and the pirates described by this trope dubbed "Peace Main" who mainly pirated other pirates. This distinction has so far been left out of the main series.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vongola family from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> have yet to do anything terribly illegal despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>. Even Reborn, the teeny-tiny assassin, never manages to <em>kill</em> anyone with his array of magic bullets. This is mainly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Tsuna</a> being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior">pacifist, who doesn't want anyone to die</a>. In the past the Vongola were known to be fiercer and much more violent.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later in the series, by the end the Future Arc, it's revealed that this trope is the real reason why Tsuna is chosen as the 10th boss. Why? Because that's how the Vongola Family was supposed to be since the very first incarnation, which is to say, more of a vigilante group of friends than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">the full-fledged criminal ring that it became</a>.</span>

It becomes something of a running joke that all they do is sit around observing the worlds below them and either making casual comments or fretting about how bad things are going, with any intervention on their part deemed "disrupting the order of things" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">leaving it up to the mortals to sort it out</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Which raises the question why they are even there in the first place</a>...

In other words, higher levels of gods are only ever introduced when they're already too weak to be plot-relevant, leading to them appearing very ineffectual as guardians. The Kaiōshin suffers from this the most. He is introduced as a mysterious being who freaks out most of the heroes merely by his presence, yet within a couple of episodes he is reduced to standing in stunned awe as the three main characters prove to be far, far stronger than himself.

The story focuses on the highest seated Shinigami who don't do that sort of work.

Tasuki himself, despite having been appointed their leader, is almost never seen actually stealing things or even expressing a particular desire to do so. In fact, he's one of the more gullible characters in the series.

When Azusa, who's more serious about musicianship, joins the "band," many arguments ensue. Unusually, this trope is a common criticism of the show—many people dislike it because they expected more concerts, or at least practicing. As far as the show is concerned, the lack of concerts and practicing is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>; it's more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei">Iyashikei</a> than a full-fledged music anime.

This was a big part of the first season, when Takumi didn't want to drive but his friends in the Akina Speed Stars convinced him. Koichiro is the only actual member who had any kind of race whatsoever. The first nearly wrecked his car, and he was completely left in the dust in the second.

Renton, a little boy with a longing for adventure and to get out of his boring town, is accepted to the famous battleship that fights against the government and has its own media franchise telling the world how cool they are and "exposing the truth". He expects all kind of cool things there, but discovered most of the crew is lazy and have no qualms in taunting and using a little boy to do all their work without thanking him, the ship is almost naked on the inside and they have little money and have to do odd jobs (usually amoral at best) to keep things going. To top it off, the captain is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parent</a> figure who turned slacker and scaredy-cat (to feelings at least) himself.

The manga shows a few of his classes and even a couple of his lesson plans, and all of them serve to demonstrate that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing. One class involves his dressing up as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman">Devilman</a></em> to teach a lesson about sociology, only to give up halfway through and show the kids how to shoot bottle rockets out of their homeroom window instead.

That said, they do play up the image of being pirates, since it makes a nice cover for their real activities. They do engage in raiding Imperial supply ships, but that's about the only "piratey" thing they do: they release any prisoners they capture unharmed, they don't attack civilians, and they spend their time sabotaging the Jupiter Empire's military rather than looting and plundering.
</li><li> We're told that the major camps in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em> are all schools, and indeed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast">characters</a> are all of the age where they certainly ought to be in school. However, all any of them do all day is fight, indulge their perversities and generally engage in mobster-like behaviour. The whole 'school' thing may as well just be a decorative theme; not once is a teacher so much as seen at all, never mind seen teaching.

A title better suited to what he actually does would be Spirit Enforcer, since the main thing he does is beat up supernatural criminals that Koenma's people have already identified.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Ninjas were covert agents and mercenaries, who engaged in such things as espionage and assassination and so on and so forth (or at least, that's what pop culture agrees they were, but the difference is semantic). While early arcs did make some attempt to play up these things, at no point did any of the good guys actually do any of it, despite being trained for it. Later in the series this is outright abandoned as the cast begins pursuing personal vendettas and fighting the bad guys using lasers and giant animals. It's less ninja vs. ninja and more super martial artists vs. super warlords.
</li><li> It's not all that clear what the intended purpose of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yuyushiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yuyushiki">Yuyushiki</a></em>'s "Data Processing Club" is, but it probably isn't "lounge around and goof off on the internet."
</li><li> The Cultural Research Club in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect">Kokoro Connect</a></em> doesn't do much. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Their advisor notices this</a> and makes them do a project for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a>, but the rest of the time they just hang out in the clubroom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>'s hero Ryo Saeba is supposed to be a hitman, and a good enough one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">terrorize most criminals he is involved with</a>. However, although he is certainly badass enough to be feared, he rarely actually takes assassination jobs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the definition of "sweeper" being "private detective/bodyguard who is illegal due using a gun in the most gun-phobic country of the world, with assassinations on the side" and only accepting to assassinate someone <em>if</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">the aspiring employer's reasons to have him murder someone touch his heart</a> (Ryo himself states this in an early story arc. Near the end of the manga we also see him <em>refusing</em> one such job because the aspiring employer was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> that wanted him to kill a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">nosy journalist</a>).
<ul><li> Umibozu too. He's initially introduced as a hitman, but the first time he tries he lets himself get bribed into failing the job (an actress had hired him to kill herself, but he happened to be a fan of hers and Ryo, who had been hired by the producer to protect her, knew it and got his help into giving her back her will to live), and when we see him in action he's usually helping Ryo for some reason or the other. In fact, the <em>only</em> time he's seriously trying to assassinate someone is an anime-only two parter, where a politician hires him to retrieve his disappeared daughter and kill the guy who had either kidnapped her or was her lover, and even then he ultimately ditched the assassination part of the job due the circumstances (the guy he was supposed to kill appeared to be Ryo, who was trying to find out why the girl was treating him as his lover for no apparent reason. Once it turned out she was on the run from terrorists and was using Ryo to defend her, the need for assassination disappeared).
</li></ul></li><li> Apart from the pilots, Yurika (captain), and Ruri (chief science officer) the rest of the crew of the Nadesico in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> seem to spend very little time running a spaceship. Specific examples are Jun Aoi (vice captain), Minato Haruka (helmswoman), Goat Hoary, and Munetake (admiral) who never seem to do anything related to their profession.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> has some in-universe examples:
<ul><li> Misty's <em>stated</em> quest is to become a Water-type master, largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGloriousWarOfSisterlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGloriousWarOfSisterlyRivalry">in spite of her sisters</a> who are implied to have been driven aground into this Trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">themselves</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lpq5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lpq5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lpq5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">all-but-abdicated their Gym Leadership</a> after being trounced by Ash's early rivals, though it's also implied that they weren't too serious about that job anyway</span> but aside from some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">water-themed captures early on</a>, she doesn't advance in this goal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">save for half of the Whirl-Islands filler arc, where she (and Ash) participate in a water-themed tournament</a>, exchanging such progress for being Togepi's nanny.
</li><li> In addition to being a Gym Leader himself, though he's on official leave from that, Brock was introduced as wanting to be a Pokemon Breeder. Yet, like Misty, that plot point was essentially dropped early on (in this case, in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">hitting on the ladies</a> ad nauseum). When he finally gets written out of the show, he's actually switched goals to wanting to be a Pokémon <em>doctor</em>.
</li><li> Ash Ketchum himself is another example. Early on in his quest, he boasts that he will catch tons of Pokémon. He has yet to back up this goal - he has not caught that many species of Pokémon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>: In the manga storyline, Natsue is the CEO of a cosmetics company but this fact is rarely stated and the only time she's ever seen doing something related to that is during a flashback from when she asked her butler to test one product. One of the other few times her job is mentioned has Himeno comment that "at least she's supposed to be".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami">Noragami</a></em>, an interesting version of this occurs. Most Gods in this story can be seen engaging in the activity which they are the God of, or at the very least engaged in the trappings of such. Tenjin, the God of Academics, looks and acts like a scholar. Bishamonten, the God of war, runs around in a stripperiffic officer's uniform atop a lion. Even Yato, a former God of war, is acknowledged to be handy with a blade, and not a stranger to killing. Kofuku however, is portrayed as a sweet, kind girl who never bothers anyone, and is friendly to all who meet her. She could almost be the sweetheart in a harem anime, if it weren't for her true title: the God of poverty. We never see her intentionally or malevolently make anyone poor onscreen. The incident where she does make someone poor seems to be an accident, and something she didn't really intend. The only real hint we get of how dangerous Kofuku is, and why she is a Pirate who doesn't do anything, is one scene where she threatens Bishamonten, who is herself a badass. Bishamonten is visibly frightened by her threat, which doesn't make much sense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">until you do some checking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">and see who has the bigger body count</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2atcq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2atcq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2atcq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to the WHO, there were 58 million deaths in 2005. Hunger <em>alone</em> took the lions share of those deaths with 36 million. Even before you take into account death from poverty inflicted disease, it's clear that poverty is far more fatal than war. This makes Kofuku the most lethal member of the cast, even though she doesn't look or act it.</span>

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em> anime turns the World Destruction Committee into one lonely teenage girl who <em>talks</em> about ending the world, but never actually seems to get around to making any progress on that front (her body count is a flat <em>zero</em> by the end of the series, and even her number of attempts can be counted on one's hand). Perhaps justified, since it's actually just a name the Ferals made up to make her sound more imposing (after all, admitting that your biggest problem is a teenager with a bad case of PMS doesn't exactly make you look like the most competent superior species). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em> manga, on the other hand, actually <em>does</em> make her a dangerous threat, and she's shown bombing a town into oblivion in the prologue, then complaining that it's not entirely annihilated because the outlines of foundations are still visible in the rubble. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She does it again several chapters in, which prompts Kyrie to leave her.</span> The World Destruction Committee is also back to being a team of people as it was in the game, though as in the game, you won't see any members besides Morte and the leader.

Naturally, we never see her actually doing much teaching, especially since her class already got plenty of screentime in the previous installment.

Chapter 75 has Iino getting the group to do some actual onscreen work after noticing the trend of them not performing their duties while in the council room. They actually <em>do</em> work, but Shirogane points out that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">never around when they work</a>.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em> is populated almost entirely by rough and tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">delinquents</a> who spend a lot of time talking about how tough they are and how many people they've beaten up, but rarely actually get into any fights and instead just hang out and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldianConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldianConversation">Seinfeldian Conversations</a>. Cromartie is also allegedly a high school but there's not a single teacher or faculty member to be seen anywhere.
</li><li> The student council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> spends all their time in scheming on behalf of The End Of The World, dueling, or doing things for their school clubs. Juri is the only member shown spending time doing normal student council activities like helping to organize school events, and even that is only in <em>one</em> scene across a thirty-nine episode anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiBLNiNaruSekaiVsZettaiBLNiNaritakunaiOtoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiBLNiNaruSekaiVsZettaiBLNiNaritakunaiOtoko">Zettai BL Ni Naru Sekai Vs Zettai BL Ni Naritakunai Otoko</a></em>: The main character notices that there's a big ammount of delinquents in the city he lives in, even though the city is really peaceful. He notes that they don't do anything, and are just in the manga for the aesthetics of the delinquent, so there can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoy">Bad Boy</a> romance in the world. The only delinquent to receive a focus is described as being pure-hearted and immediately falls in love for an honor's student.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero">Nero</a></em>: Another literal example of this trope is the character Abraham Tuizentfloot, a dwarf who claims to be a pirate and dresses like one too, despite not owning a ship and even being unable to swim!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>: Tintin's reporter credentials are sometimes used as a plot device to get an adventure moving, but always without him having to report on anything. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheShootingStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheShootingStar">The Shooting Star</a></em>, he is chosen as a member of a scientific ocean voyage as the on-board reporter. Not only does he do zero reporting during the adventure, several times other journalists report on <em>his</em> activities. Every story he's featured in is apparently supposed to be his report of the events, but this isn't made explicitly clear. In <em>Tintin and the Black Gold</em> however we do see him interview the head of a large company at the start of the story, again without taking notes or recording anything. The only time Tintin ever wrote a press report was in his first story <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em>, an album considered non-canon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio">Spirou and Fantasio</a></em>: Spirou is a hotel bellboy/piccolo, but we never see him perform this job in the albums. He just wears the suit all the time!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GastonLagaffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GastonLagaffe">Gaston Lagaffe</a></em>: Gaston is supposed to help his colleagues out with the creation of each new magazine by answering fans' mails, but most of the time he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a> who's sleeping at his job, performing one of his hobbies, inventing stuff or causing accidents and other disasters that just make the working possibilities for others impossible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz">Viz</a></em> used to have a strip called "Captain Morgan and his Hammond Organ" about a pirate who sails around playing songs on his Hammond organ - and not much else. This is part of the reason why the character was eventually scrapped (along with threatened legal action from the copyright holders of some of the music.)
</li><li> David X and his Empire of Zen Crime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Casanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Casanova">Casanova</a></em> are described thusly:
<div class="indent"><em>Its like crime, only therere no victims, and really, no crimes. It really just spreads a general sense of unrest</em>.
</div></li><li> Arcade from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> is supposedly a badass ace assassin. The problem? <em>He never manages to kill any superhuman targets</em>. He kills his reputation by consistently punching above his weight class by going after super-heroes. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by establishing that Arcade is considered a complete joke by the rest of the supervillain community, because he has no powers and fails to kill anyone other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggles</a> . . . his primary motivation for creating the Arena is to prove them wrong. Unfortunately, by mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize">targeting teens and young adults</a>, be becomes the super-villain equivalent of a pedophile, and by televising his attempts, he becomes a liability to the other villains, who fear the heroes will treat them more harshly because of his actions.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the second volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em>, in the "Pirate's Conference" chapter of the Travellers Almanack, it's noted by Captain Clegg (actually the former identity of later League member Dr Syn/The Scarecrow) that one of the attendants of the meeting, Captain Pugwash (the main character of an old British kids cartoon), is far too jovial and inoffensive to possibly make a proper pirate. Especially compared to the other attendants, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Hook</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainBloodHisOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainBloodHisOdyssey">Captain Blood</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>: The Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters does remarkably little teaching and quite a bit of political sabotage and supervillain-fighting, and the only classes appear to be combat training. This is because initially the school really was just a cover. This presents a scenario in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolAU">High School A.U.</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> where the students live at a school only to attend another school during the day. The movies did change this somewhat, and in modern times Xavier's does appear to be accredited.
<ul><li> Not helping is that, between 1970 and the early 00s, the "school" usually only had one (1) teenager on campus (first, Kitty Pryde, then later Jubilee), and everyone else was an adult, fully satisfied with the level of education they had.
</li><li> More modern stories show most of the students as children, with the actual X-Men either adults or late teenagers. These days they are the school <em>staff</em>. In the spirit of the trope, they're generally never seen teaching or doing anything school-related.
<ul><li> Also, in spite of many of these characters having been continuously published for decades, none had ever been seen going to college to get the degrees necessary to be on staff at an accredited school, save one, and that's Iceman, the team prankster (economics, by the way). Compare that to Spider-Man where the difficulties of being a superhero, holding a job, and being a student were a big part of the character.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A fairly literal example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>, where the resident gang of pirates seems to exist for the sole purpose of having their ship wrecked whenever the Gauls run onto them. It's not that they don't <em>try</em> to do actual pirating, they just never seem to get an opportunity to before they get sunk again and need to swim to shore and find a new ship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em>: Morris created Lucky Luke in 1946, as a cowboy who took time off for adventure. Since Goscinny took over the writing in the 1950s, Luke has been in very few cattle drives.
</li><li> Swerve from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a></em> is a metallurgist by training, but he rarely uses his skills during the quest and instead spends most of his time running the ships bar. This comes back to bite him in the season one finale; he tries to use his metallurgical skills to get assigned to an important mission, and Rodimus angrily points out that hes been serving drinks for the last year before telling him to piss off.
<ul><li> On a larger scale, the fact that the Lost Light crew spend little time on the actual quest theyre supposedly on (finding Cyberutopia) and keep getting distracted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">Wacky Wayside Tribes</a> is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>. It also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up leading to a mutiny. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Getaway</a> uses it to convince much of the crew that Rodimus is an incompetent loser whos never going to get them to Cyberutopia and that their best bet is to kick him off the ship and let Getaway take command</span>.

</li><li> Wally from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> does absolutely nothing at his office, to the point of being referred to as "the Wally" by those outside the organization. He claims he only comes to work because he doesn't know how to make coffee (and doesn't want to pay for Internet access, according to the animated series).
<ul><li> The character of Wally started out as a plot (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">Based on a True Story</a>) about a competent worker who was deliberately trying to get himself fired by acting lazy and abusive because the severance package was so good. However, he's long since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> into being lazy and incompetent. A few strips have shown that he has made so much money by investing in the competition whenever the company enters a new market that his net worth is higher than that of the company itself.
</li></ul></li><li> Der Inspektor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheKatzenjammerKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheKatzenjammerKids">The Katzenjammer Kids</a></em>, arguably the world's first comic strip. Although he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">known only by his title</a> as School Inspector, he never really did that job. This might by partly because he was initially representing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Imperial Prussia</a>, a power which no longer exists, and partly because he realized that getting Hans and Fritz (i.e. the Katzenjammer kids) to stay in school is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">next to impossible</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey">Beetle Bailey</a></em> and his fellow soldiers have been in the Army during three major foreign wars (Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan/Iraq), plus numerous small-scale interventions (Grenada, Somalia, Panama, Lebanon, Kuwait), yet they never actually seem to deploy out of Camp Swampy.
<ul><li> As <a class="urllink" href="http://wondermark.com/the-comic-strip-doctor-beetle-bailey/">The Comic Strip Doctor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> put it, "He is a soldier who never kills, in an army which never fights, for a country which never calls on him."
</li><li> The general consensus seems to be that Camp Swampy is one of the Army's dumping grounds for its failures. Given the general level of competence displayed up and down the chain of command, that theory appears to be very sound. This also might explain why they're still wearing and using 1950s-era equipment.
</li></ul></li><li> Though it varies from year to year, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HagarTheHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HagarTheHorrible">Hägar the Horrible</a></em> is a Viking who hardly ever, well, Viks. Granted this is arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as real Northmen didn't raid all the time either, but many early strips did in fact show Hagar actively attacking and looting castles(indeed, his wife Helga was a girl he carried off in one such raid).
</li><li> Jon Arbuckle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> is a cartoonist, but the only time he is actually shown working on a cartoon is in the first strip. His job proceeded to be mentioned <em>only two times</em> later in the strip, the first being when he went away to a cartoonist's convention in 1984, then <em>twenty-six years</em> later in 2010, Liz informs her parents over the phone about Jon's cartoonist job. He is frequently seen working in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGarfieldShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGarfieldShow">The Garfield Show</a></em> animated series, though. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mezzacotta.net/garfield/?comic=476">Parodied<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SquareRootOfMinusGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SquareRootOfMinusGarfield">Square Root of Minus Garfield</a></em> and played straight in the fan comic <a class="urllink" href="http://galesaur.com/portfolio/jon/">Jon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which depicts him showing off his studio to Liz' friends and <a class="urllink" href="http://galesaur.com/portfolio/jon-2/">having a Dealers' Den booth at a convention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Nearly all the protagonists have some sort of exalted title (Sokka and Katara are prince and princess of the combined Water Tribes, Zuko is Fire Lord, Aang is the Avatar, Toph is an Earth Kingdom noble who supposedly runs a quarter of the kingdom), and none of them seem to have any royal duties whatsoever. Katara and Sokka spend most of the story lounging around on one of Toph's estates, and Zuko and Aang soon join them. The only times we see a protagonist do something related to their jobs is when the main characters attend a ball in Katara's honor and when Zuko is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubcommittee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubcommittee">Hauled Before A Senate Subcommittee</a> for abandoning the Fire Nation to be with Katara.

The Straw Hat pirates still don't attack civilians but they steal plenty from bounty hunters, marines, and other pirates. Besides looting Whiskey Peak, their first ship was Buggy's and their second (which they stole because Buggy's was too big for less than twenty people to man outside of calm waters) was <em>Smoker's</em>. Lastly, when Robin joins the crew early, Luffy offers that if King Cobra won't allow her to read Alabasta's poneglyph as a reward for saving his country, they'll simply have to "convince" him to let her read it.

No raiding of other societies is mentioned — in fact, the Vikings are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the ones getting raided</a>, by dragons. Given the events of the movie, it's possible that the dragon raids are so disruptive that they're focusing most of their time on getting rid of that issue; however, in the sequel, there is still no indication that they're doing any raiding.
</li><li> Colonel Hathi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook1967">The Jungle Book (1967)</a></em>. He calls his herd a "company" and their migrations "marches/drills". Although he agrees to help Bagheera find a missing Mowgli, it's unclear in what capacity he is, in fact, a military commander. He implies he was a war elephant in the colonial army in the past, so it may simply be that he's mimicking human customs. A line in the elephant marching song hints the herd know full well what they're doing is pointless but they're doing it anyway.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Rainbow Rocks</a></em>. The Humane Five have plenty of time for high school extracurriculars, like soccer, band practice and setting up for a school dance, but they're not seen going to class all that much. For how much time they spend doing non-academic things, Canterlot High School must have an incredibly easy curriculum.
<ul><li> And as far as the non-academic things go, Human Rainbow Dash is said to be the captain of nearly every sports team at the school, yet is almost never seen playing sports in any formal capacity (having, so far, merely kicked a few soccer balls at Twilight and rode a motorcycle during the Friendship Games, if you want to consider the latter a sport at all) let alone something as time-consuming as managing several teams.
</li></ul></li><li> The crew of the <em>Jolly Roger</em> (Captain Hook's ship) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>. They never seem to do anything other than "roaming over the sea" (as one of the pirates sings while playing his concertina) and trying to kill Peter Pan and his allies. Oddly, during the song "The Elegant Captain Hook", they sing that Hook is "the world's most famous crook" - without telling us what he did to deserve that fame. However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explained away</a> when the pirates are first introduced: they <em>were</em> more traditional pirates in the past, up until Captain Hook lost his hand to Peter Pan and became obsessed with revenge on him, forcing the crew to stick around while Hook pursued his vengeance. Most of them are thoroughly sick and tired of their captain's personal vendetta by the time of the movie, and want nothing more than to leave Neverland and get back to "the business of looting ships". In fact, they seemed close to mutinying when Peter brought the Darlings to Neverland.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> In Hollywood, this was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">The Hays Code</a> was in effect. One of its stipulations was that films could not show <em>how</em> criminals committed crime or "subversives" did their deeds. As a result, audiences were often asked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">Take Our Word for It</a> that villains had done the unspeakable.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Film:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The protagonist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Werewolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Werewolf">Werewolf</a></em> identifies himself as a news writer, but we don't see him writing at all. This did not go unmocked when the film appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Crow:</strong> "So I guess our hero will get back to his <em>writing</em> now..." <br/><strong>Servo:</strong> <em>*scoffs*</em> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger">J. D. Salinger</a> writes more than this guy."
</div></li><li> The various pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> are mostly seen attacking navy ships, each other or supernatural creatures. Apart from collecting all of the cursed Aztec gold, we rarely see them actually stealing anything from merchant ships or ports. At least in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">first movie</a>, this was something of an intentional joke. Part of the writer's concept of the script was to do a pirate movie in reverse: a band of murderous rogues sailing about and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">collecting treasure so that it can be returned to its rightful owners</a>. The first film averts it however. The opening has a merchantman discovered destroyed after a run-in with the <em>Black Pearl</em> and we do see Port Royal attacked and several innocents murdered by <em>Black Pearl</em>'s explicitly villainous crew early in the first movie. In the second film, the crew of the <em>Pearl</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">complains</a> that it's been a while since they've done any "honest piratin'." After that, however, the series basically just gives up and mostly portrays the pirates as some kind of a romantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. This is mainly achieved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">portraying everyone else as even worse than the pirates</a>. Most notably, the portrayal of the Royal Navy shifts from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a> in the first movie to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> from the second movie onwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">The Dread Pirate Roberts</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>. We only see him after he's retired from piracy. He also admits that the Dread Pirate Roberts' fearsome reputation for taking no prisoners tricks everyone into handing over their loot without a fight, so presumably Wesley never had to commit murder during his tenure.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids">Spy Kids</a></em> universe, the definition of the word "spy" seems to be "person who dresses sharp, has cool gadgets and kicks butt". Actual espionage never seems to be depicted. Not even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction">martini-flavored</a> kind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHell">From Hell</a></em>: While the rest of the prostitutes of Whitechapel go about the oldest profession right onscreen, Abberline's love interest Mary Kelly just seems to hang out, looking vulnerable and doomed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em>, where Inara's profession is so glossed over that you wouldn't have any idea that she's basically a courtesan/escort for hire unless you're familiar with the series. Only one easily missed line about seeing clients "in this very bed" gives a hint.
</li><li> For being a movie about a man's rise to power in a mafia-like organization, there is little crime shown being done by anybody in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyDangerously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyDangerously">Johnny Dangerously</a></em>, even by the various villains. Johnny is aiming for a kinder, gentler sort of criminal family, after all (the movie is a spoof).
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainBlood">Captain Blood</a></em>, regarded as one of the greatest pirate movies of all time, suffers from this. Blood is the greatest pirate in the world, but the only people he ever kills on screen are members of foreign armies and one perverted French captain. He's also never shown stealing or sinking other ships unless it's against enemies of England (Which would make sense if they'd said that he was a privateer sailing under a British letter of marque rather than a genuine pirate), and the other members of his crew are all rough, rougish, and jovial rather than a bunch of cutthroats. Even when the main villain, who abused them as slaves, is in their grasp, they happily just comically throw him overboard rather than kill him. The movie only barely glosses over his life as a pirate and thief, and it comes off as rather jarring when the love interest refuses to be with him because he's committed crimes we've never seen.
</li><li> Justified (weakly) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightHeadsInADuffelBag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightHeadsInADuffelBag">8 Heads in a Duffel Bag</a></em>. The protagonist of the film claims that his fiancee is a race-car driver, and shows another character a photo of her sitting in a racer to prove his point. But we never see her do anything remotely connected to racing (which, yes, makes her something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a> as well). We do see her in a fast-moving van toward the end of the movie, but she's not the one doing the driving (she and her family have been taken hostage by a mobster). It is easily explained by the context of the movie, since the young woman is on a vacation in Mexico almost the entire time. But if his fiancee's job wasn't going to be pertinent to the story, why did the hero bother telling us about it?
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReeseWitherspoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReeseWitherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a> film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowDoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowDoYouKnow">How Do You Know</a></em> has a professional softball player as the heroine; but five minutes into the movie, she is dropped from Team USA and never so much as picks up a bat again.
</li><li> There's a montage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RealGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RealGenius">Real Genius</a></em> of how, over the course of a school term, fewer and fewer students stick around to attend one of Mitch's lecture classes, leaving tape recorders running there instead. By the end of term, Mitch is the only student still sitting in the classroom, and even the <em>instructor</em> has left a running tape player in his place to lecture for him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hr53');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3hr53" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hr53');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wouldn't it take just as much time and effort to actually make the tape for the instructor? The only thing he's avoiding is answering any questions, and that's a moot point because there's almost no one else in class. Of course, he might "teach" the same course the same way every semester.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaUntold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaUntold">Dracula Untold</a></em>, the Elder Vampire, despite his big talk about conquering the world, only attacks people who come to his cave. When he's released to the world he does absolutely nothing for more than 500 years. Or at least, nothing that we see - though his dialogue in the final scene suggests that he's been waiting for five hundred years, quite possibly just to screw with Vlad.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThingsChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThingsChange">Things Change</a></em> is all about gangsters. While a murder trial is the catalyst for the plot, we see almost nothing criminal occur. The film seems to suggest a world where gangsters do nothing but play cards, cook food, drink liquor in stately drawing rooms, and own casinos.
</li><li> In the opening scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyThousandLeaguesUnderTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyThousandLeaguesUnderTheSea">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a></em> we see 3 ships sunk or crippled on-screen by the Nautilus, and it's clear that several other ships have met similar fates. But once the main characters come on board, Nemo and his men only attack one ship on-screen over the course of many months - and dialogue supports that this is the only ship attacked in that time period, so we know he didn't go after any other ships during any time skips.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfRiddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfRiddick">The Chronicles of Riddick</a></em>, the Necromongers were on an unholy crusade to end all life in the universe, and from much of the movie's background exposition it sounds like they had made significant progress toward this goal. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick">Riddick</a></em>, after the title character has become the Lord Marshall of the Necromongers, they don't seem to do anything but skulk about menacingly and try to assassinate Riddick for not actually converting to the faith. The final shot of the film shows that they are literally parked above the gates to their version of Heaven, but are not doing anything to actually <em>get there</em>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">The Room</a></em>:
<ul><li> The film informs us that Johnny is ostensibly a banker in spite of his vampire-like appearance and limited English, yet we never see him doing anything resembling what a banker's job is outside of apparently dressing like one (most of the time; on one memorable occasion, he sports an ill-fitting blazer, a tank top and cargo pants.) At one point, he says that another bank would not cash his check because it's from an out-of-state bank, which if he were a banker, he'd know this is untrue.
</li><li> Lisa does something with computers, and it's considered a rather competitive field, but she spends the film just sitting around the apartment either waiting for Johnny or cheating on him.
</li></ul></li><li> Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski">The Big Lebowski</a></em> is famously depicted as an avid bowler. He spends several scenes hanging out in a bowling alley with his friends, and he keeps a bowling ball prominently displayed in his house. But despite this, he's never actually seen <em>bowling</em> at any point in the movie. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4k4bz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4k4bz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4k4bz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The closest he comes is in a dream sequence, where he holds an imaginary woman's arm while <em>she</em> rolls a ball.</span> Seriously: in its entire 117-minute runtime, he never even touches a bowling ball.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VioletAndDaisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VioletAndDaisy">Violet &amp; Daisy</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out Daisy has been using blanks because she doesn't actually want to kill anyone, even though that's her profession. However, she actually does kill The Guy in the end-though at his request</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977">Suspiria (1977)</a></em>: For a movie taking place at a ballet studio, we see almost no dancing. There's only a single scene where some of the background extras do basic drills while our protagonist is too ill to dance properly and collapses. After that, nothing. Obviously, this is because the two main actresses are not ballet dancers.

Huck isn't troubled, since he calls it "borrowing."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bigtime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bigtime">Bigtime</a></em> series, Captain Freebeard and his Saucy Wenches are technically pirates, but they only rob the occasional passing cruise ship, and all they ever take is food and booze so they can throw wild parties. Between the fact that the passengers of the cruise ships invariably get invited to said parties and the fact that they are almost as good at helping endangered mariners as the local Coast Guard detachment, nobody in the area considers them important enough to hunt. The cruise lines even consider them to be a tourist attraction.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a> in Jennifer Fallon's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemonChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemonChild">Demon Child</a></em> and <em>Hythrun Chronicles</em> series is practically an official branch of the government, with high-ranking officials  even sympathetic ones  constantly looking the other way regarding their activities and frequently enlisting their help. Mostly justified, as the God of Thieves, Dacendaren, is a recurring character who enjoys taking an active hand in human affairs, and the Hythrun people quite reasonably want to avoid annoying him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>
<ul><li> The <em>Compleat Discworld Atlas</em> introduces the faraway country of the Neverlands. This is a twofer: its backstory is that it may once have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">a pleasant land where over millennia the people reclaimed land from the sea and built huge earth dikes to hold back the ocean from spilling into the reclaimed farmland</a>. which worked just fine until the dikes broke, leaving only a chain of disconnected islands. These became a haven for pirates. Who over another few hundred years or so got lazy and devised a whole new way of separating people from money: the Neverlands now hosts the Pirate Experience Theme Park, promising exciting holidays by the sea in resorts staffed by authentic Pirates. The main location is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey">Barry Island</a> - ''another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">twofer</a>...
</li><li> Despite the Unseen University being a university, the Wizards are never seen actually holding lectures, or indeed doing anything related to what their jobs and titles are supposed to be (except the Librarian and Archchancellor Ridicully, who has a highly specialized idea of what his job entails which generally boils down to "shout at everyone else"). In fact, at any point the idea of them actually teaching students at all is met with horror and revulsion. This is, however, an intended function of the University; for the wizards of old (and the impulse still exists), doing "something" would mean trying to kill each other and laying waste to the land in the process, so the many distractions of overly-civilized life in UU are a safety precaution.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> Pteppic is a trained assassin who is very uncomfortable with killing anyone and never does it - although he does end up killing a pyramid and, in a way and indirectly, his country's whole godly pantheon. He's accompanied by Ptraci, a concubine whose extensive carnal knowledge is implied to be entirely theoretical.
</li></ul></li><li> At the beginning of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> series, most of Pern feels this way about the dragonriders. Since Thread hasn't fallen for four hundred years, most believe that the threat of Threadfall has ended and the dragons aren't needed anymore. At one point in the first novel, the Lord Holders and their armies actually march against Benden Weyr to bring it down. Unfortunately for Pern, the only reason Threadfall hasn't happened in four hundred years was because it was a Long Interval... which lasts only four hundred years. It turns out Threadfall has been going on for <em>weeks</em> by that point, but since winter was unusually harsh that year, it fell as harmless black dust. Even more unfortunately, the casualties they suffered after their first real fight against Threadfall makes it painfully clear to the dragonriders that one drastically understaffed Weyr cannot protect everyone on Pern on its own.
</li><li> In the young adult novel <em>Dreamland Lake</em> by Richard Peck, the narrator mentions that he used to be in a neighbourhood gang called the Oakthorpe Avengers. Since there were no rival gangs anywhere nearby, though, the Avengers never actually had to defend their territory or anything.

</li><li> Despite the text telling us repeatedly that Ana is the most brilliant of commissioning editors who even worked on her honeymoon (something that never showed up in any of the honeymoon scenes) and that she had a knack for editing even when she was Jack Hyde's personal assistant (where the only things she did were filing and typing up one letter poorly), her "job" appears to consist of letting <em>her</em> personal assistant Hannah make plans and set up meetings for her, going to one meeting with her colleagues and bosses, talking about meeting in person with an author, and looking at the file of a manuscript for two seconds. At no point does she do anything that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.allaboutcareers.com/careers/job-profile/commissioning-editor">a commissioning editor would normally do<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the course of business.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> novel never explicitly describes any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened">collection of protection fees</a> by the Corleones. Income from gambling and prostitution is mentioned briefly and indirectly in the book and the film. The only attempted protection racket happens in a flashback to the 1920s (shown in film in <em>The Godfather, part II</em>), where Don Fanucci tries to blackmail the young Vito Corleone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who realizes that Fanucci is unprotected himself, murders him, and becomes the new Don</span>. Possibly justified since the Don and other senior members of the family would not do the dirty work themselves, leaving that to lower-ranking "soldiers." The book also states that this is partially done for reasons of security - because there are at least two layers of cutouts between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">The Don</a> giving the order and the gangster committing the actual crime, even if the mafiosi is caught red-handed, the police can't tie the crime to a Corleone in a way that would stand up in court without breaking him, his boss, and his boss' boss.

Not that this matters much, since her bosses never print any of it anyway. All she seems to do is spend her time going to places and cashing her increasingly ludicrous traveller's cheques. This is because she's actually War, killing time before Armageddon kicks in.

The closest he gets is one scene where a bar owner presses him about paying his tab and Kuni responds in a threatening manner- but rather than offering "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShameIfSomethingHappened">protection</a>" as a gangster would be expected to do, he instead points out that the liveliness of he and his friends helps bring in and keep customers, and their presence dissuades troublemakers from causing trouble.

Justified in that at the start only Blake and Cally were actually career terrorist/freedom fighters. Everyone else was convicted of crimes such as homicide, smuggling, theft, and white collar embezzlement. In the series itself they are on the run. So unsurprisingly, they mostly just commit more crimes of that type, making them simply ordinary petty crooks.

As the series progresses, she begins to perform some maid-like duties for the Cranes as well, though is often shown resenting this, weirdly, since she was hardly over-worked with her "real" job.
<ul><li> Daphne's vacation time comes up now and then, and is often portrayed fairly straight as something quite important to her. This can seem a bit jarring to the viewer, considering it's hardly obvious what Daphne would do on vacation time that she doesn't already do with all the free time she already has.
</li><li> It was established in the pilot that Martin doesn't <em>need</em> full time therapy; her employment was initially a mistake by the agency. But the Crane men all like her so much, they keep her around.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em>, Vivian averts this for the first season because she is a teacher and is signed on to teach Will and Carlton's black history class; however her job is at best almost never mentioned after the first season. The second-season episode "Hi-Ho Silver" confirms that she quit her job to spend more time at home.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> where the four characters with regular jobs talk about their bosses not liking them. Joey, who is normally an out of work actor points out that maybe it's because they are all hanging out at a coffee shop at 11:30am on a Wednesday.
</li><li> Will from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> is a Spanish teacher who seems to spend very little time teaching Spanish (also, the few times he is seen speaking Spanish, his accent is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">very poor</a>). It becomes kind of ridiculous in the first episode of season three, when Sue announces her intention of making sure all the high school arts programs are removed. Will becomes very upset, not only because he believes it's a mistake to take away the arts from the kids, but because his livelihood is at stake... conveniently forgetting that coaching the glee club is something he volunteered to do, and that he is first and foremost a Spanish teacher. Lampshaded in Season 3, Episode 12, titled "The Spanish Teacher." Will admits that he doesn't know much about Spanish and takes a night class in Spanish, taught by someone much more qualified at Spanish. He ends up becoming a History teacher and the other character becomes the new Spanish teacher. Not that we see Will teaching History very often either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenWing">Green Wing</a></em> deliberately uses this: though set in a hospital, there are no medical storylines. Guy, Caroline and Mac do perform surgery from time to time but, naturally, the whole thing is played for laughs. On one occasion Dr. Statham burst in, had an argument with Mac about a parking space and attempted to eat the patient's gall bladder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, Monroe is a clock-maker. Despite this, he only ever has anything to do with clocks in one episode.
</li><li> Robbie Ray Stewart is, as much of the dialogue suggests, the main in-universe writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>'s string of gold hits, but with few exceptions, such as the occasional special song, or something that carries the plot of the episode or a joke or resolve, you rarely saw or heard him in action.
</li><li> Nathan Petrelli of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> is appointed to the U.S. Senate in Season 3. He is never shown voting on any motions, amendments, or bills, attending any committee meetings, meeting with any constituents, or doing anything else that a U.S. Senator's job entails. He is instead able to focus all his time and efforts on running his own personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Ralph Kramden is a bus driver, but is never actually shown driving.
</li><li> We never got to see Norton working either, but then, he works in the sewer, so who'd want to?
</li></ul></li><li> Derek, Burger and Ash from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImInTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImInTheBand">I'm in the Band</a></em> are in Iron Weasel. But in most episodes, they usually slack off in Tripp's apartment and don't do much, despite Tripp suggesting them do some rehearsing. Tripp puts emphasis on this in the season 2 opener "I'm Out of the Band".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em>: Outside asking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">"have you tried turning it off and on again?"</a>, the main cast don't do much work, and when they do, they're usually faking. In one episode they're shown to have developed a machine that picks up the phone, delivers the lines and leaves them with even less work. Reynholm Industries itself just has "a lot of sexy people not doing much work and having affairs". How is this company still running?
</li><li> The Royal Family on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingdomOfParamithi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingdomOfParamithi">The Kingdom Of Paramithi</a></em> do little other than reward citizens, read stories and watch plays.
</li><li> According to the "You Are a Pirate" song from the "Rottenbeard" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown">LazyTown</a></em>, nothing much is required of being a pirate. "<em>Do what you want, 'cause a pirate is free... If you love to sail the sea, you are a pirate!</em>"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em>: The titular Gokaigers are this for the most part, since they're more interested in adventure and finding the Greatest Treasure in the universe than doing any actual piracy. In fact, early on the Space Police reveals that all charges of piracy were made up by the Zangyack Empire just because they've been opposing them for a long time.
</li><li> This is the basic plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaidMarianAndHerMerryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaidMarianAndHerMerryMen">Maid Marian and Her Merry Men</a></em>; Marian wants to believe that she's the leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, but she's more like den mother to a group of overgrown kids who spend their time inventing bizarre games and, in Robin's case, designing uniforms.
</li><li> Noser from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddleman">The Middleman</a></em> spends an awful lot of time not playing the guitar. He also has an incidental sideline in not riding a motorcycle, and an entire episode built around his not being a ventriloquist.
</li><li> This is the entire point of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> sketch <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snotr.com/video/3074/Non-illegal_robbery">Non-Illegal Robbery.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The head of the gang draws up plans that at first glance look like they're going to rob a bank and a jewelry store, when in truth they're withdrawing money from a savings account and buying something. Then he panics and orders his henchmen to flee the country when he realizes that they didn't put enough money in the parking meter and their getaway vehicle is in danger of being ticketed.
</li><li> While the students in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a></em> do in fact go to class, Gordy The Janitor never seems to do any janitor-related. Like everything in this show, this gets lampshaded.
<div class="indent">"I'll get the night guy to do it!"
</div></li><li> Matthew on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em> is a reporter, and on early episodes is actually seen doing his job, but for most of the show's run he's hardly ever seen doing anything but hang around the office and be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>. In one episode he explicitly does nothing but play computer Solitaire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em> plays this as a plot point. Michael is constantly interrupting everyone's work with his various self-indulgent obsessions, causing employees to occasionally protest that they have too much work to be fooling around. Jim also seems to spend most of his time in the office planning and performing pranks because he's bored with his career. In spite of all this, work <em>is</em> getting done. We're frequently told that the Scranton branch is the highest-performing branch in the company, some episodes do show the cast hard at work. The implication is that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">documentary</a>" simply doesn't show us the parts where nothing is happening except work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurMissBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurMissBrooks">Our Miss Brooks</a></em>: We almost never see (or in the radio version, hear) Miss Brooks actually teaching English, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">she's said to be quite good at it</a>. The rare glimpses seen of Miss Brooks <em>actually</em> teaching are usually played for laughs, such as her tutoring of Stretch Snodgrass in "The Yodar Kritch Award". The same goes for Mr. Boynton, whose canonical biology lectures consist of one about the skeletal structure of frogs in "Mr. Conklin's Wake Up Plan".
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PietPiraat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PietPiraat">Piet Piraat</a></em> is a Belgian children's show about a good-natured pirate crew, which could be seen as an example of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> has Divatox and her crew. They're space pirates but we rarely see them loot or plunder anything (outside of the episode that debuted the Phantom Ranger). Divatox wants to conquer planets and that's WAY beyond her profession. Somewhat justified in that she <em>does</em> declare at the start of the series that their main goal from that point on will be to destroy the Power Rangers, in revenge for their destroying her intended groom Maligore.
</li><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit">Profit</a></em> where the plot revolves almost entirely around the eponymous character doing his job, albeit in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">rather</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMail">creative</a> fashion.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roots1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roots1977">Roots</a></em>, slaves seem to have an awful lot of free time. Much is made of major outrages (rape, children being sold away, mutilation of runaways) but little emphasis on the horror of performing agricultural work 70 hours a week for no pay from age six till death.
</li><li> Sarah Jane Smith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em> is supposedly a reporter, but we never see her doing any actual reporting. She spends most of her time battling evil aliens, something she has explicitly vowed to <em>not</em> report on. Lampshaded in that Sarah's standard excuse when she dashes off somewhere is "I have to go file a story!" This is <em>never</em> what she's actually going to do. However it's actually averted in the final episode when it's revealed that she is known as one of the country's top reporters-presumably, she has been working off-screen.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, one of the recurring "Weekend Update" characters is their resident political comedian, Nicholas Fehn (played by Fred Armisen). Despite bearing the title "political comedian," he never actually does any comedy; he reads newspaper headlines and responds, "No wayyyy! No! Can't do that!", and spouts out a series of unformed thoughts and unfinished sentences till Seth interrupts him, telling him he's not really saying anything. Then Nicholas accuses Seth of not wanting to think or use his brain.
<ul><li> From the early days and done occasionally when he'd guest host, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a> would be Weekend Update's movie reviewer and make Oscar picks, but had never seen any of the nominated films.

Normally, he only cleans if he really doesn't have anything better to do.
<ul><li> This is an acknowledged fact in-universe:
<div class="indent"><strong>Janitor:</strong> I'm sorry, Carla, I can't help you, I have work to do. <br/><em>(entire room bursts out laughing)</em> <br/><strong>Janitor:</strong> Ah, that one always kills.
</div></li><li> At one stage, he bets JD that he can't memorize everyone's name. If JD loses, he'll do the Janitor's job for one day. If the Janitor loses, <em>he'll do his own job for one day</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>JD:</strong> Do you remember how? <br/><strong>Janitor:</strong> It's been a while.

<div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> Ah, you had a good run. Took 'em to the World Series.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> ...I gotta give the players most of the credit for that.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> Don't sell yourself short. You made all those flight arrangements, hotels, busses...
</div><div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> Nah, I don't know who was doing that.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> So when you actually did work, what is it that you did?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> <em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>)</em> ...I'll tell ya, they had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
</div></li><li> Worf's status as a Klingon could appear to be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. His warlike, belligerent attitude was so at odds with the requirements of his superior officers (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edflm7Hh3hs">as this video shows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and the peaceful Federation, that one could suspect that if he ever <em>acted</em> the way he was <em>written</em> then he'd end up on a penal colony instead of the bridge of the flagship. Incidents when he actually has a chance to act Klingon frequently ended in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>. Oddly enough, the opposite occurred when he joined <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. His Klingon side got defined more clearly, yet his new Starfleet duties did not. He was purportedly the first officer of the USS <em>Defiant</em>, and yet more often than not, Jadzia Dax or Major Kira would fill the role of commanding officer during Captain Sisko's absences, not him.
</li><li> Jadzia Dax on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> is officially the station's chief science officer, but a vast number of her mentioned or onscreen jobs/contributions seem more fit for an engineer like Chief O'Brien, specialists like Dr. Bashir and Ezri, or command officers like Captain Sisko (i.e., repairing replicators, being the Defiant's helmsman, commanding the Defiant repeatedly when Sisko was out-of-action, and sometimes working as an equal with Bashir in medical affairs). In any given episode, she's very likely to be doing at least one task that normally wouldn't be performed by a general science officer, and instead assigned to a different crew member.
</li><li> Jackie Chen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SzeUTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SzeUTonight">Sze U Tonight</a></em>. He has a role in the show's production team but rarely turns up to work, and yet somehow has the backing of TVB's executive chairman.
</li><li> Aside from the first few episodes, the kids from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> are too busy solving mysteries to bother attending school. This only serves to emphasise the show's pervasive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>.
</li><li> Played intentionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnhappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnhappilyEverAfter">Unhappily Ever After</a></em> - Jack is firmly established as a used car salesman who frequently skips work and rarely sells a car when he does come in. In the finale, he finally starts taking the job seriously and makes enough commission in a week to fund Tiffany's entire Harvard tuition - then he goes back to being a slacker to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> save Mr. Floppy's life.</span>
</li><li> Notably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>; Weevil and his PCH bike club actively engage in biker gang activities, although they aren't as violent as real life gangs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeirdAlShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeirdAlShow">The Weird Al Show</a></em>, Val Brentwood, Gal Spy doesn't actually perform any espionage or anything spy-like. Given the number of episodes where actual spy work would be useful to Al or his friends, it's surprising that she pretty much doesn't do anything but hang around at Al's house.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WeirdScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WeirdScience">Weird Science</a></em> when the guys want to become vampires to be cool but not actually suck blood. Lisa grants the wish, albeit replacing the lust for blood with lust for the chocolate beverage Yoo-hoo. So aside from the Yoo-hoo thing, being a vampire for them basically consists of being admitted to a night club that they were too nerdy for before.
</li><li> Once on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, the president is bedridden and watches a daytime soap opera. He asks, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Do any of these people have jobs?</a>" His bodyguard answers, "One of them's a surgeon... I... think." Within the show itself, we see a lot of the staff doing their jobs. The President himself seems to mostly though be doing the PR side of his job and reacting to military situations that develop. We never really hear what his legislative priorities are or what kind of legacy he wants to leave. When Bartlett list his accomplishments late in the series (and well into his second term) he mentions a Supreme Court justice he appointed and Economic Growth... and thats it.
</li><li> Captain Feathersword, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a></em>, sings pirate songs and causes mischief with his crew but doesn't actually do anything very piratey. Which is just as well, what with his... feather sword.

Note that there are some aversions, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a> actually working in a funeral home or Ray Traylor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossMan">Big Boss Man</a>) being a former corrections officer.

They all display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">man hating tendencies</a>, and Lacey's even hinted at homophobia despite acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">girly girl lesbian</a> with Rain in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER">SHIMMER</a>.

They like to trick unsuspecting rookies into doing manual labor for them, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">are not good people</a>.

<ul><li> This occurs very frequently in CRPG games. Organizations such as armies, mage academies, and thief guilds never seem to resolve (or attempt to resolve) problems on their own, instead delegating the task to the player and assuming he'll take care of it without help, despite the organization leadership being allegedly far more powerful and capable than said player. By the end of the game, one wonders why they are still regarded as the top of their field when they didn't take on any of these challenges themselves.
</li><li> The MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> features gnome pirates who have to constantly remind each other to talk "piratey." They're bad at following through on the details, but they like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">idea of being pirates</a>.
</li><li> Samus Aran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a> who has apparently spent her entire career hunting a single bounty. Perhaps the definition of "bounty hunter" has changed (and Nintendo's reaction to Retro's proposal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3">Metroid Prime 3</a></em> suggests as much); all of her jobs are given to her by the government, and involve a cross between reconnaissance and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanArmy">One-Woman Army</a>.
<ul><li> Not to mention her nemeses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>, who seemingly exist only to antagonize her. Then again, Samus keeps breaking into their bases. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Prime</a></em> subseries manages to deal with this in a decent way—the Pirate Logs throughout the games establish that the Space Pirates <em>do</em> have a life and plans outside of trying to kill "the Hunter" (their little nickname for her gives you a guess what Samus does during her down time) and were active for a fair amount of time before Samus came onto the scene, thus the bounty on the lot of them.
</li><li> Retro Studios planned on having Samus fulfill more of a bounty-hunting role in <em>Prime 3</em>, namely, by having the player pick out actual bounties to go after. The higher-ups vetoed this, in part because of the Genre Shift it would entail and in part because Samus doesn't really fit the role of bounty hunter to a T. The guys at Retro jokingly referred to her as a "pro-bono hunter" instead. There's also a story about how when Retro Studios made the suggestion, Nintendo's Japan-based officials were horrified at the suggestion of Samus becoming a "murderer" and being paid to do this; apparently "bounty hunter" wasn't quite the most accurate translation of their intended title for Samus Aran.
<ul><li> Which is somewhat ironic, given that her clearly stated mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em> was to <em>commit xenocide</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In a few issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em> there was a tie-in comic series to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>. A new character - a male bounty hunter - was added in as a sort of rival and irritant to Samus. While she continued blasting her way through the underground tunnels, he would stop to pick up the space pirates' "ears" or claws or whatever alien body part they were. After he started going on about how rich he was going to be after turning these body parts in for the bounties, Samus actually expressed disgust at his mercenary ways.
</li><li> Notably, at the start of <em>Super Metroid</em>, with the last Metroid captured and the Space Pirates seemingly blasted to smithereens, Samus does mention searching for a new bounty to hunt. Then, of course, the game happens, and Samus is half doing it for revenge, and half doing it because the previous bounty from the first Metroid clearly <em>still</em> hasn't been fully honored.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Falcon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> falls into a similar rut, although the focus of his series is mainly on his side-business, racing. All of his Bounty Hunting (other than an aside mention in <em>GX</em>'s Story Mode about him chasing a bounty through Samurai Goroh's territory and getting caught up in a race with him) is literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> are allegedly plumbers. However, the only thing they ever seem to do involving plumbing is their habit of traveling via pipe — <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pbfcomics.com/213/">which real plumbers are not noted to do either,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but never mind...
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperMarioBros">live-action movie</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, they <em>do</em> use their plumbing skills to stop an attempted sabotage/flooding at a dig site and then in a castle basement. Likewise, the animated series would occasionally show them using their plumbing skills and equipment, either for actual plumbing or for dire situations.
</li><li> Referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em>, when Loggo the toilet complains of being clogged:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kazooie</strong>: Then call a plumber. I think Mario's free at the moment. <br/><strong>Loggo</strong>: I don't think he actually does that kind of work anymore...
</div></li><li> Also referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThereWillBeBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThereWillBeBrawl">There Will Be Brawl</a></em>, where Mario claims to have done a lot of things, but denies being a plumber.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> he was working on a skyscraper as a carpenter.
</li><li> The "plumber" thing is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros">Mario Bros.</a></em> Thing was, his business wasn't just plumbing even then, but rather unusual sewer pest control (both the pests and the method of control). Which is really not much different from what he's done ever since. His skills are probably a lot more specialized than your average drain unclogger. You wouldn't hire the Ghostbusters to rescue a stray dog, would you?
</li><li> In contrast to most of the <em>Mario</em> universe, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NintendoComicsSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NintendoComicsSystem">Nintendo Comics System</a>'s <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> comics from the early 1990s feature a surprising amount of plumber-related content. The brothers built an impromptu network of water pipes to cool down a volcano, and saved the day when Bowser's poorly-thought-out plan to destroy the sewer resulted in a flood. There was also a running gag about Mario's obsession with a comic book series about a plunger-wielding plumber superhero. The shorter comic strips in between the stories included Luigi taking the reader on a tour of a plumbing museum, and Mario and Luigi's childhood trip to plumbing camp.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a></em>, the first mission in the Haunted Towers is called "A Job For a Plumber", and indeed, Luigi has to restore the water supply to the mansion to complete the mission. Of course, the way he does it - fighting ghosts, monstrous crows, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant">Man-Eating Plants</a> - isn't the type of thing you learn for such a profession. Professor E. Gadd's statement after finishing the mission implies he doesn't know that Luigi is actually a plumber by trade either.
</li><li> This trend of the Mario Bros. not doing any plumbing is finally (and canonically) averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>'s opening cutscene. Mario and Luigi use plumbing tools to fix an actual pipe.
</li><li> Nintendo occasionally refers to Mario being a plumber in the past tense, it just being one of the <em>many</em> occupations he's had, alongside things like carpenter, doctor, and, of course, princess-rescuer. One instance of this caused a brief panic among fans until <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-03-06/nintendo-officially-reinstates-mario-as-a-plumber/.128625">Nintendo reassured them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he's still a plumber, although he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">"not limited to that."</a>
</li><li> Princess Peach for that matter doesn't do many royal duties either despite being the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom. She usually just stands around and looks pretty whenever she isn't kidnapped or playing games with her friends (and enemies). Sure, Peach does go on adventures herself and protect her kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach">Super Princess Peach</a></em> and the various RPG games, but she never does anything involving ruling her kingdom. The royal guards never do their job either, practically handing Peach over to the villains with next to no resistance. Bowser, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">actively rules his kingdom in many of the games</a>. He commands his army and orders the construction of new settlements, among other things. Considering how much respect Bowser's minions have toward him despite his evil deeds (as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>, where they serve him out of admiration instead of fear), Bowser might very well be a better ruler than Peach.
</li><li> Daisy would probably count as well. Her home kingdom of Sarasaland was only shown in her debut game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand">Super Mario Land</a></em>, where Mario had to save her after she's been kidnapped by aliens, though it's sometimes mentioned in her biographies for the spinoffs where she's often seen with Peach beginning with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis">Mario Tennis</a></em> except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>, not counting the trophies and stickers.
</li></ul></li><li> The town of Rogueport in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is a parody of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity">Vice City</a>-style setting, and as such has several examples of rogues, bandits, and roughnecks who are rarely, if ever, seen stealing or doing other unsavory things. Goombella even remarks of one character: "At least he's supposed to be a thief, but I've never seen him steal anything."
<ul><li> There are a few subversions. While having a conversation with Toadsworth, the player can see two members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">Pianta Syndicate</a> beating up members of the rival Robbo Gang. At one point, a bandit robs Mario of some coins, forcing the player to track said bandit down (the trope is zigzagged when the bandit returns the coins without a fuss, upon being caught). Also, one side quest has Mario track down a bandit that conned a Goomba. When the bandit is caught, the Goomba carts him off for, it's heavily implied, some less than savory retribution.
</li><li> The explorer in Flipside in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> never actually goes out and explores anything, but he might say a few things about places Mario and company have already been to as the game progresses.
</li></ul></li><li> The "great adventurer" Toma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> spends pretty much the entire game drinking in a bar and talking big... which does, at least, get acknowledged in-game. In the game's present day, you learn that he <em>did</em> find what he was looking for, at least.
</li><li> Blue Rogues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> are more in the nature of random do-gooders and adventurers, and look down on pirates who actually engage in, y'know, <em>piracy</em>. Some exposition reveals that Blue Rogues are in it for the challenge; any ship that can defend itself is technically a valid target. Vyse's little group still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">kill people and take their stuff</a>, as per the genre standard... they're just very selective of who they do the "killing" part to. As they do spend a lot of time messing up the navy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">not-Spanish-really</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Empire</a>, one could think of them as English privateers without an actual England to endorse them, at least until the end of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">when they essentially</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">start their own England</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, early on in the game, you might find you're getting less money than you could be for discoveries because a treasure hunter is discovering them first. You'll eventually meet him, in a restaurant run by a pirate you trounced earlier. He'll join you if you've discovered thirty discoveries, but if not he'll just hang around in the restaurant, not hunting much of anything, until you have.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers</a> of Time/Darkness</em>, there's an exploration team composed of a Slakoth and a Slowpoke who call themselves "Team Slackers, the zero-motivation exploration team". Each time they appear, they point out the fact that they don't really do anything besides just laying around, and they wonder why they even formed an exploration team in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em>, pirates who actually <em>do</em> anything pirate-related are about as frequent as chicken's teeth. Even the protagonist, self-proclaimed "mighty pirate" that he is, never does anything more nefarious than your average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">Kleptomaniac Hero</a>. The first game lampoons the idea with Guybrush's crew (who he has travelled all over Melee Island to find) flat out refusing to help him and instead sunbathing on the deck, treating the journey to Monkey Island like it's a cruise holiday. He does get the opportunity to sink the ship later in the game, instead travelling back with the Island's hermit, Herman Toothrot, who has his own ship. It turns out in the fourth game that this is canon and his former crew are pissed off with him because they had to find their way back to Melee without a ship (i.e., had to make some effort).
<ul><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em> (in which the pirates are afraid to sail because there's an evil ghost ship on the loose) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em> (in which the Largo Embargo does not <em>allow</em> them to sail). Also lampshaded all the time by the responses Guybrush gets when he claims he's a mighty pirate ("You look more like a flooring inspector!").
</li><li> This gets tossed out the window in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland">The Curse of Monkey Island</a></em>. You even get defenseless tourists to prey on if you want. In the same game, Guybrush <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">calls his crew out on this trope</a> when it seems they'd rather sing than sail.
<div class="indent">You say you're nasty pirates, <br/>Scheming, thieving bad bushwhackers; <br/>From what I've seen, I tell you <br/>you're not pirates, you're just <em>slackers!</em>
</div></li><li> Out of the first two games full of pirates who don't do anything, the Men of Low Moral Fiber do by far the most nothing. They're slack enough in the original, but they spend pretty much the entire sequel dozing on a ledge. They have a lot of excuses for why they're up there.
<div class="indent"><strong>Man of Low Moral Fiber:</strong> No, it's the opposite of acrophobia... <br/><strong>Guybrush:</strong> Sounds more like WORKAPHOBIA to me.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em> ramps this trope up to 11, to the extent that it lessens the blow of the pirates getting overrun by tourists. For instance, compare the SCUMM Bar from the first game, where pirates are downing grog, swinging on chandeliers and passing out on tables, to the one in the fourth game, which has about two or three people sitting around and playing darts.
</li><li> The rather dynamic opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland">Tales of Monkey Island</a></em>'s first episode is one large callback to series traditions. Guybrush faces LeChuck once more, complete with mystical voodoo artifact - assembled through yet another long-winded quest - a ship, lots of alleged treasure and a lazy crew sleeping in the hold.
</li><li> Then you <em>finally</em> see some proper pirates besides LeChuck in The Siege of Spinner Cay (the second chapter of <em>Tales</em>). You <em>do not</em> fuck with McGillicutty.
</li><li> In the fourth episode of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, it's revealed that the Pox of LeChuck that's been driving the conflict only affects <em>real</em> pirates, proving that while Guybrush may not be much of a pirate, he <em>is</em> a pirate.

They're even ruled by a little girl whose mother was the previous pirate leader. They do eventually engage in about one and a half acts of actual piracy, but they don't seem particularly cutthroat in either case.
</li><li> It gets worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, where Tetra seems to have gone <em>crusader of the seas</em> and wants to scold the owners of the "Ghost Ship" for kidnapping people. Which should be common business for pirates.

Nabooru is sincerely horrified, to the point of open mutiny, by Ganondorf's conduct: "Though we're both thieves, I'm completely different from Ganondorf.

</li><li> Depending on the game, Princess Zelda is shown doing very little by way of actual ruling. This tends to be justified by her being blocked by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotNowKid">disbelieving father</a> (we have yet to see a competent King of Hyrule), being taken prisoner by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, being placed in an enchanted sleep, etc. In most cases, the best she can do is contact Link and send him to save her and Hyrule.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, you become a squire... which explicitly, as your knight tells you, doesn't require you to clean his stables and polish his armor, or really do anything at all expected of a squire.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> series at least tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> the latter as much as it can manage (mostly that said adventurers have come into a situation they couldn't handle alone and need a group to help them with), but still lets in a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> here and there.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Gordon Freeman is a scientist who is never really seen doing any science. Even in the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, briefly depicting him working with the other Anomalous Materials Team members, his contribution to the experiment is pressing a button and pushing a cart. General consensus is that all the other scientists were <em>better</em> qualified (at least had seniority), given they all had access past biometric scanners where Freeman did not. On the other hand, Barney's comment <em>Looks like you're in the barrel today</em> indicates Gordon just drew the short straw for this particular anomalous materials assignment, and would otherwise be reading gauges and writing equations on chalkboards with the other labcoats.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>, after Gordon has thrown a switch as part of a lab experiment:
<div class="indent"><strong>Barney</strong>: Good job Gordon, throwing that switch and all. I can see your MIT education really pays for itself.
</div></li><li> Perhaps also referenced in Gordon's meetings with the G-Man, who alternately refers to Gordon as "Mister Freeman" and "Doctor Freeman", with audible sarcasm quotes around the latter.
</li><li> Less obvious is that he is stated to be a <em>theoretical</em> physicist. In reality theoretical physicist don't really conduct many experiments, they basically sit around to think about really complicated math problems. The name was probably chosen to indicate Black Mesa research is getting at technology we can only imagine in real life, but if they're using it, it shouldn't be considered theoretical for <em>them.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> Vaan wants to escape the poverty and oppression of Archadian occupation to become a sky pirate. Fran and Balthier are notorious sky pirates. And Reddas is a former sky pirate who runs a whole smuggler's port full of sky pirates. Don't expect to see any actual piracy in the skies though (or on the high seas or anywhere else for that matter), or even an explanation of what sky pirates actually do with the massive amount of free time they seem to have.
<ul><li> It's mentioned in-game that the moniker "sky pirate" has drifted from "person who robs airships" to a generalized sort of adventurer-type who probably spends more time hunting monsters and raiding ruins.
</li><li> We do get to see plenty of sky pirates in action in <em>Revenant Wings</em>. Aside from the player characters it seems to involve theft, murder, slavery, and the odd bit of genocide. The player characters prefer to beat up other sky pirates and take their money, which is only somewhat less reprehensible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Duodecim</a></em> lampshades this, as the name for the mannikin version of Vaan is "Idle Sky Pirate."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> has a band of pirates stuck in an inland sea, where there is little to no sea travel, because of the Torna Canal being closed. Pillaging seems to be beyond their understanding; if you do sail into town, they'll just head for the inn and get drunk, forcing you to actually pay the undefended townsfolk for any goods you need.
<ul><li> Averted by their leader Faris, whose first reaction to finding out she has a princess in her custody is to hold said princess for ransom, and then subverted again when she discovers that said princess has the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket">Orphan's Plot Trinket</a> as she does and realizes that they are long lost siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, we have the Turks (Reno, Rude, Elena and Tseng mostly), who are supposed to be high ranking officials of the intelligence and security division of the Shinra Electric Company. Instead of doing any administrative or security work, they spend most of the game trying to abduct Aeris.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by Elena, the Rookie. When you meet them in Wutai Rude and Reno are too drunk to stand and she tries to get them to fight you. Rude replies that they are in Wutai on vacation.
</li><li> The Mayor of Midgar is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityInNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityInNameOnly">Authority in Name Only</a> whose only real purpose is to be officially in charge so Shinra can pretend that the city isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">Company Town</a>. In truth, he does almost nothing in regards to running the city (or at all), and when Avalanche raids Shinra HQ, he helps them out of sheer boredom.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, the Dead Dunes are populated by a large gang of supposed bandits. They are never shown attacking or robbing anyone and there really isn't anyone else in the area for them to prey on even if they wanted to. It could be argued that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveRobbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveRobbing">plundering the local ruins</a> but since the premise of the game is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the world is going to end in a few days</a> it is doubtful that anyone would care.
</li><li> Seth and Sed of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> are both pirates, but we never actually see them participating in piracy, despite Sed, having a ship (though no crew).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> has Wess and Duster, practitioners of the Thief Arts. One of the conversations with the townsfolk involves a girl calling you "a thief that doesn't steal anything." They do sneaky things, yes, but not in a criminal way. They are considered to be somewhat odd by the other villagers, though.
<ul><li> It does bear mentioning that, pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, Tazmily was an idealistic paradise that didn't have or need any form of currency, and everyone was happy to help one another out; there WAS nothing to steal (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Hummingbird Egg</a> aside, but Wess was the one who'd put it where it was, anyway).
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to other Pirate examples; the pirate crew in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em> doesn't seem to be, well, that piratey. They seem to be more Mercenaries/hirable ferry. However; they are a bit of an aversion of the pirate tropes - Lyn is very distrustful of them merely because pirates actually <em>do</em> pillage and plunder because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">her parents and the rest of her tribesmates WERE killed by bandits</a>...
</li><li> Remember all those mighty heroes of the first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> games? Well those who survived long enough to appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> apparently earned the privilege of sitting around getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Characters</a> to do all the heroing for them. Their main excuse is that they need to hold the fort. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Partially justified as they are almost all royalty or rulers and can't go putting themselves in harms way</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general throughout the series, the player can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory">become the head of several guilds and factions</a>. Fortunately, nobody expects you to do things like <em>run</em> the organizations, participate in politics, debate religious doctrine, etc. After all, that would interfere with your <em>actual</em> job of delving into caves and fighting bandits and monsters. There are a few exceptions, however. To note:
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em>, in that it is established that you aren't actually <em>head</em> of the various guilds (not even of the regional guild, as in <em>Morrowind</em>), just amongst the most high-ranking members.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">Imperial Cult</a>. You can only advance so far due to not being a full time priest, even after the local leadership has noticed you have <em>met</em> several of their gods.

It is, instead, the mid-level ranks where the player doesn't have to do any of the stuff that is supposed to come with the rank<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note517t9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note517t9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note517t9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The entire point of the Mouth position is to represent their Master in council and handle a lot of the actual political running of things so their Master doesn't have to.</span>.
</li><li> Most people recognize that the protagonist is sufficiently badass that their time is better spent battling world-threatening events than doing paperwork. For instance, far enough into the main quest, you end up appointed "Hortator" by the three Great Houses, supposedly making you a joint warchief. Rather than being put in charge of any armies, though, <em>you</em> are officially recognized as a one-person army. They even tell you that your new duty is to venture into dark and dangerous places where no one else would dare to enter. In addition, many organisations have established procedures with middle-management people running things smoothly (and possibly dipping into the till) without the important people at the top having to bother.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> None of the named members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a> are ever shown actually doing their jobs (unless they are specifically accompanying the Dragonborn). They much prefer sitting around the clubhouse, swapping stories of their past exploits, and cajoling the Dragonborn into doing their missions for them.
</li><li> Downplayed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGuild">Companions</a>, who you may run into in random encounters in the wilderness hunting sabrecats and mammoths and such. If you are observant on your way to Whiterun for the first time, you may see a group of them killing a giant who was harassing a farm when you come to Whiterun.
</li><li> Also Downplayed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">College of Winterhold</a>, but it's very easy to miss. Every day at around 2 PM, lectures on magic will be held in the college, so it is carrying out some educational practices.
</li><li> Minor guild the Bard's College generally averts this - the members are seen brushing up on lore, practicing musical instruments, singing, all of the usual bardic stuff. <em>You</em> are the one they allow in to explicitly handle outside jobs.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Dr Z in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing">Dinosaur King</a></em> (the DS version) wants to realise his dream of riding on the backs of dinosaurs. He does nothing (aside from his initial act of acquiring a Dinoshot to summon dinosaurs) towards that aim during the entire game, instead getting his minions to go around, menace the local populations, and infest areas with robots.
</li><li> Faith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> is a Runner, carrying important data across one of the few remaining unmonitored channels left in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">the City</a>. Or at least, that's what we're told. She only actually gets one message to deliver, and passes it off to Celeste before the end of the first chapter. Later events reveal it probably never got there. There are some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews">Kent Brockman News</a> reports paranoid about those employing the Runners suggesting a good portion of the population has hired one before, but there isn't much reason to actually believe them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Most of the other Runners seem to be more interested in political assassination or selling out friends.</span> Justified, since Faith spends the rest of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being hunted by the government after they interrupted her first delivery of the game</span>.
<ul><li> This is also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>: unlockable content reveals that the bags played a larger role in early drafts of the plot, which seems to have been recycled into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdgeCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdgeCatalyst">Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</a></em>, which makes much more of an effort to show the Runners in action: they're hired as couriers, thieves, and occasionally saboteurs by everyone from ordinary citizens, to crime lords, and even, it's implied, the Conglomerate themselves on occasion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> is explicitly a separate group from the Runners (though some Runners do work for them). The early main story missions and the side missions are all about standard day-to-day Runner activities, before Faith sticks her nose into matters that get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> on her tail.
</li></ul></li><li> The nominally "mercenary" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em> team aren't very mercenary-ish in their business plans. Despite turning General Pepper's offer to join the army down cold in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em>, Peppy replaces him and leads the army in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand">Star Fox Command</a></em>. The ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em> shows that Pepper paid the team quite a bit (depending on the score). They also were paid for Sauria and the Aparoid business. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em> actually begins with the team in a financial crisis from their lack of mercenary activity.
<ul><li> The rival Star Wolf team seem to get it wrong too, since they are considered criminals. Granted, realistically mercenaries are always a bit shady, but just living out the "whoever pays"-style doesn't warrant bounties.
</li></ul></li><li> For bandits, we really don't see much banditing from Moses Sandor and his band in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia">Tales of Legendia</a></em>. Even when they move their base into town after being forced to leave their former base, the townspeople come to consider them to be pretty friendly people. Though their former does appear to show that they may have done plenty in past based on Moses room and all the gold they had.
</li><li> Reimu from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">miko</a> in charge of maintaining the Great Hakurei barrier. From what everyone's seen, that consists of drinking tea, sweeping, and more tea.
<ul><li> Averted in <em>Silent Sinner in Blue</em>. Not only does Reimu spend the early part of the manga practicing to call upon the powers of Sumiyoshi, her opening battle with Yukari Yakumo involves her calling upon Ama no Iwata Wake no Mikoto. So she isn't so lazy that she never practiced channeling deities.
</li><li> The official title of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Patchouli Knowledge</a> is librarian and tutor of the Scarlet Mansion, however no-one but her actually uses her library (with the exception of Marisa's regular bouts of kleptomania) and it seems unlikely Remilia values a good education. Granted, researching new magics might be what Remilia hired her for, this being an instance of "do what you love doing".
</li><li> Reimu's case is lampshaded and deconstructed in <em>Mountain of Faith</em>; none of the humans pay the Hakurei Shrine more than lip service because Reimu doesn't fight the youkai as expected of a miko. So when the Moriya gang arrives, sets up their shrine, and starts actually sending their miko to fight youkai, Hakurei followers quit in favor of the new guys who actually do the job, endangering the Shrine and by extension the Barrier.
</li></ul></li><li> Dupre in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> was apparently the mayor of Trinsic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em>. He joins the Avatar's party in the local tavern, where he's mostly busy drinking. And nobody ever brought his job up in the following parts of the series. But being a mayor was easy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em>, when characters didn't have daily schedules implemented yet, anyway!
</li><li> Most of the pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alundra2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alundra2">Alundra 2</a></em>, only time we see proper pirates is in the protagonist's flashback. Protagonist himself, a pirate hunter, doesn't really do any pirate hunting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> assassins seem to follow this trope. None of that 'professional murder' business in this child-friendly MMO. Even if they are supposed to be ninjas instead (orange <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> gear ahoy), they don't fare terribly well at this either, being in no way stealth-driven and generally picked by the most look-at-me showoffish players in the game. Pirates fare no better, since any running away from these so-called ravening hordes is generally down to the reputation pirate players tend to have on <em>MapleStory</em> forums, rather than any notion of actual piracy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuest">AdventureQuest</a></em>: There's vampires who never drink blood, rogues who never do anything particularly rogue-like, a treasure hunter that's almost never seen hunting treasure, a water elf who spends disturbing amounts of time on dry land well away from water, and a farmer who'd rather be a dread necromancer... among other things.
</li><li> Johnny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> is ostensibly a pirate captain, but all we really see him doing is flying around on his airship and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">hitting on the various female cast members.</a> He also seems to be friends with Ky, who is <em>head of the world police force.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>: Adam Jensen is supposed to be the chief of security to Sarif Industries, but after the opening scenes he doesn't spend two minutes doing his actual job, instead being turned into a spy/hitman/all around problem solver for his boss. The job description of a security chief should rarely involve crawling around ventilation ducts and disposing terrorists personally.
<ul><li> Somewhat lampshaded if your gaming instincts take over and you start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">looting your coworkers' offices</a>: eventually you'll get emails asking Jensen to investigate a series of petty thefts in his capacity as chief of security.
</li><li> The original plan for the opening level/tutorial averted this: it was going to feature Jensen breaking in to a secure facility, only to have it revealed at the end that the facility belongs to Sarif and it was all part of a demonstration of security vulnerabilities.
</li><li> The previous idea is somewhat referenced the actual game: if Jensen infiltrates the terrorist occupied Sarif plant via the vent on the roof, he informs Prichard that he will mention the vent on his next security report, presumably with the intent of getting that liability resolved.
</li></ul></li><li> The player character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> never does any marriage counselling or pedicuring or whatever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptAptitudeTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptAptitudeTest">GOAT</a> selected for them. Justified in that it was supposed to be your job in the Vault... which you end up having to flee from the very day you turn of age. Averted by Butch DeLoria, who was assigned "hairdresser", and later admits to being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">barber</a></em>.
<ul><li> Like the above Elder Scrolls examples, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> can have the player become the General of the Minutemen and the Head of the Institute within relatively short order of meeting both. As the heads of such, you don't seem to do much battle planning for the Minutemen (unless "walk in with Power Armor and a mini gun and kill everything in sight" counts as planning), and you don't do much actual scientific research for the Institute (hell, you can become the leader of the greatest post-war scientific institution with a comically low Intelligence score of <em>1</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>: the actual pirate champion, Captain Gangplank, used to be treated as one of the comic relief characters, with his stereotypical pirate slang and his cannonballs and his ability to eat oranges to "cure his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">scurvy</a>" and break out of curses and stuns in the process. He is, however, the only champion who was willing to shoot his <em>own men</em> to give others a "morale boost" (now removed for balance reasons). As more lore was released, it became clear that behind the child-friendly model is one of the worst bastards in the League.
<ul><li> Miss Fortune isn't much better. While she does have a better reputation than Gangplank, this is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Bilgewater's standards</a>, and it's made clear there's a reason she's also a wanted criminal. The main difference is she doesn't treat her crew as completely disposable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has a burgeoning pirate population, all of whom seemingly just wander around their cove and/or play drinking games. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">make you clean their ship</a> because they're too "busy" to do it, or anything else, themselves. Their ship never even leaves port unless you pretend to be the captain and guide them somewhere. The only time they do <em>anything</em> significant is in the special secret ending to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the hippy/frat war, where the pirates launch a barrage of cannonballs and bomber airships to destroy most of the island</span>. And that still isn't really <em>pirating,</em> because they don't bother with stealing things or capturing hapless maidens; they just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blow stuff up</a>.
</li><li> The Mongols in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em>. They <em>might</em> take one or two fortifications or throw an army at your capital every once and so often, but overall they just tend to sit there looking menacing, even on higher difficulties. Guess the Khan just felt like taking a holiday in Europe rather than conquering it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> features "thieves" who can be hired by the player. When they are, they act as quick and agile fighters. The rest of the time, they are just hanging around on rooftops and other hidden areas and looking "stealthy". Either way, they never seem to do any thieving at all. And then there are the prostitutes (called courtesans). Their job is to distract guards, which they are remarkably good at considering that they never actually put out. This is handled better with the Romani dancers in <em>Revelations</em>, who are actually <em>meant</em> to be a distraction.
</li><li> Averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></em> which takes place during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfPiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfPiracy">The Golden Age of Piracy</a>; <em>everyone</em> who calls himself/herself a pirate, player character Edward included, participate heartily in <em>proper</em> piracy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Funnily enough, it seems to have inverted the trope somewhat in-series as although there's plenty of piracy and Edward is fully capable of assassination, the actual nature of <em>being</em> an assassin is downplayed and Edward doesn't even join the cause formally until the last leg of his journey, this did not escape the notice of many longtime fans of the series.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>:
<ul><li> Party member Citan Uzuki is supposed to be a doctor (well, as well as a mechanic, engineer, scholar, martial artist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">master swordsman</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spy for Solaris</span>, ...), but he is never seen actually doing much medicine. He has one in-game ability related to healing, but it is more magical than medical and at least two other characters (who are not doctors) have similar abilities.
</li><li> In the beginning of the game we can see that the main character Fei is a quite gifted painter and enjoys making art. During the rest of the game, Fei is arguably busy being the hero and generally being at the center of several multi-millenarian plans which will determine the fate of the world, but we <em>never</em> ever hear anything again about his artistic vocation. It only lasts for a few <em>seconds</em> at the beginning of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That said, his painting is still quite relevant to the plot, especially when the protagonists find a centuries old portrait with a similar technique...</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em>, the player character Corvo Attano is the Royal Protector, which means he is supposed to be the Empress' personal bodyguard and to protect her from threats at all times. So <em>why</em> does she send him far, far away for months on a quest to find a cure for the plague which is decimating her city? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out there's actually a reason for this: she did so on the recommendation of the Royal Spymaster, who's trying to assassinate the Empress and wants a few months without Corvo so he can hire some untraceable assassins that can bump her off without interference.</span>
<ul><li> In the extension <em>Knife of Dunwall</em>, you play the master assassin Daud. Daud is not a nice guy and killing people is supposed to be his job, but you can play in a completely non-lethal way if you want. If you do so, this is lampshaded by your lieutenant, who points out that you're not yourself these days and that <em>not</em> killing people is not your habit. (This is more or less justified by the fact that Daud is questioning himself and feeling guilty for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murdering the Empress</span>.) However, if you go out of your way to murder everyone and leave a pile of bodies at your wake, your lieutenant will think that you're slipping since as a master assassin you really shouldn't be killing that many people.
</li></ul></li><li> The Pirate storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a> Nova</em> really doesn't make the player character into much of a pirate — it is about resurrecting and then leading the Association of Free Traders, who are more <em>smugglers</em> than pirates (they're a group of semi-legal free traders banded together to protect themselves from piratical predations and the Federation's blatantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>-slanted trade laws). The only plundering going on is aimed at <em>actual</em> pirates, and consequently tends to be ignored by the legal authorities.

She's initially surprised that her father wants to take on cargo, thinking it's the wrong job for pirates, although is mollified somewhat when he says he means dangerous, maybe-illicit cargo. Also, she notes that Razzo probably needs to work on his piratical instincts. ("Isn't this stealing?")
</li><li> Gameplay-wise, Medics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic">Team Fortress Classic</a></em> gradually were used more and more exclusively for flag-capturing rather than as healers.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, a lot of classes can specialize in things other than their job indicates: Demomen that engage in melee combat rather than any demolition, Medics who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">attack rather than heal</a>, Spies and Scouts who never pass on any information they may have on the other team, Pyros that never set anything on fire, etc.
</li><li> Zigzagged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> character Kurtis Stryker. While from the beginning, he is described as and seen doing the duties of a police officer, his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</a></em> bio card says he is also a former member of the United States Marine Corps. and had served in the Gulf War. Unlike with Sonya and Jax, who are members of the U.S. Army Special Forces and wear their military identification necklaces, no evidence before or since has ever been seen of him being in the service.
</li><li> The only time we ever see <em>any</em> member of the World Annihilation Front actually trying to destroy much of anything is the very start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em>, where Morte tries to bomb Viteaux (she mostly just succeeds in scaring people, not actually causing damage - and one city is by no means the whole world). She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader">technically the leader of your group</a>, but never manages to talk anybody into trying to actually, y'know, destroy the world (she does at least <em>mention</em> the idea, but everyone else just kind of chalks it up to Morte being nuts and goes on with their business; you actually end up <em>helping</em> more people than you hurt. There are other members of the Front, too, but you never see them or hear of their exploits. Perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in the end, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Front's leader actually wants to remake the world with himself as its supreme ruler, rather than just raze the place to the ground</span>.

Karol, Yuri, and Judith form the guild "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Brave Vesperia</a>" at the start of the second act, but they ultimately don't do much guild work outside of sidequests (which are mostly available in the third arc).

</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em>, where Benwick and the other members of Aifread's Pirates happily talk about their past exploits, but don't really do any piracy during the game. That's because the captain has gone missing, and while nobody has any issues taking orders from First Mate Eizen, his priorities are trying to find the captain, then supporting the rest of the party's goals, both made much easier by keeping a low profile. Additionally, since every shipping lane in the world is controlled and protected by the Abbey, most pirate crews have given up on merchant raids and spend their time raiding the pristine-but-uninhabited ruins of the far islands instead.

She actually does none of that, acting more like a secretary who informs you of incoming messages and tells you when a crew member asks to speak to you. And she feeds your fish, if you flirt with her. The only "insights" she provides are when a newly recruited squad mate just reports aboard, and all she gives you are platitudes that you've already figured out for yourself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Jacob Taylor</a> is the one who actually has a better handle on crew morale.

<ul><li> Didi is supposedly a teacher but this rarely gets mentioned beyond the requisite "taking Tommy to work" episode, where Chuckie's imaginary friend seems to remember her grading papers, and another when Stu asks why she's home and she reminds him it's summer.
</li><li> Drew lists his occupation as investment banker, but this comes up even less. Likewise Chaz is a bureaucrat, but this is never shown and seldom referred to.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>'s a sailor man (toot toot), and certainly engaged in lots of high seas adventure in the comics, but famously had very few encounters with ships or even water in his animated cartoons. An average of one <em>Popeye</em> cartoon per year (out of ten to twelve made) showed the sailor actually doing his job. A big exception was during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, where quite a few cartoons portrayed him as having (re)joined the navy.

In truth, they spend most of their time there scavenging for candy and he seems to actively avoid doing anything that involves leaving the harbor or performing and when they do go on an adventure, it's usually because of either Flapjack dragging him along or the promise of the sweet paradise of Candied Island tempting him into it.

<ul><li> The Whalers of the Moon, who freely admit there aren't any whales on the moon, and even have a song about it.
</li><li> Professor Farnsworth, who is only seen teaching in one episode (he intentionally makes his course titles sound difficult so no one will sign up).
<div class="indent"><strong>Professor Farnsworth:</strong> I don't know how to teach. I'm a <em>professor</em>.
</div></li><li> Likewise, this episode is the only one in which Amy, ostensibly an engineering student, is shown attending class. She's also an intern at Planet Express, but never seen to do actual work there. It's outright stated in the second episode that Professor Farnsworth keeps her around because she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTransplant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTransplant">the same blood type as him</a>.
</li><li> Planet Express itself never seems to do deliveries anymore. Lampshaded in an episode by Hermes:
<div class="indent"><strong>Hermes:</strong> Didn't we used to be a delivery company?
</div></li><li> Lampshaded <em>and</em> serves as a plot point in "Future Stock" when the company is taken over by the 80s guy Steve Castle. Leela points out that, despite all his peacocking and gloating, the company hasn't made one delivery since he took over. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, his only motivation is to make the company look like a rival to Mom's Friendly Delivery Company to raise their stock and sell the company to make a fortune. He doesn't actually need to make deliveries to do that</span>. The same episode has this exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Leela:</strong> <em>(after seeing Planet Express's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/NineteenEightyFour">newest ad</a>)</em>: That was terrible! People won't even know what we do!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> <em>I</em> don't even know what we do! Nah, just kiddin'. Heh. What are we, like a bus or somethin'?
</div></li><li> The reason is given over several episodes that Professor partially founded Planet Express just to send delivery crews to their deaths, and fund his attempts to create atomic monsters.
</li><li> Speaking of Bender, his own position at Planet Express is pretty unclear. For most of the first season, he doesn't even have any actual job. Then he becomes the chef, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">dangerously terrible at it</a>. By the time of the revival, he's been bumped up to "assistant manager of sales."

When Leela responds by asking for something to eat, he stalks out of the room, returns with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and throws it at her.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded yet again in the 100th episode, where the crew celebrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">their 100th delivery</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hermes:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">That's almost 10 per year!</a>
</div></li><li> Scruffy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">the janitor</a>) is never seen doing any actual janitorial work, and almost always just reading dirty magazines, right from the minute we see him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> Who the hell are you? <br/><strong>Scruffy:</strong> I'm Scruffy. The Janitor. <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> Well, why aren't you fixing the boiler? <br/><strong>Scruffy:</strong> Schedule conflict. <em>(turns page of his magazine)</em>
</div></li><li> Zoidberg is very rarely seen doing any actual medical work. Of course, given he's <em>Zoidberg</em>, this is pretty justified. He states in one episode how the only reason the crew even tolerates him there is because he can cut things. Although, another episode also said <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he and Farnsworth had a secret deal that Zoidberg would kill him when the symptoms of hypermalaria surfaced so he wouldn't die a gruesome death from it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> by Rayla, who is part of the Moonshadow Elf assassin team which takes an oath to kill King Harrow and Prince Ezran of the human country of Katolis. She certainly possesses all the skills of an assassin and is considered a teenage prodigy, but she has never killed a person before and falters when its actually time to do it. What sets the whole plot in motion is when she spares the life of a human sentry after seeing the terror on his face, and his report enables their enemies to get defenses ready, which results in all the assassins except Rayla getting killed or captured. Rayla ends up teaming up with Prince Ezran and his stepbrother Prince Callum after they discover that the egg of the Dragon Prince was not destroyed after all, and they can stop the war by bringing it back to the Dragon Queen, but Rayla still identifies as an assassin and struggles with the shame of having failed and deserted her teammates.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>'s titular character almost never does the sort of work a samurai would do. Most pivotally, the signature trait of a samurai was their devotion to a single feudal lord, which Jack doesn't have, as he spends most of his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> as a lone rebel.
</li><li> The Ant Hill Mob in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop">The Perils of Penelope Pitstop</a></em> don't seem to be involved in any mob-like activities at all. When they first appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em> they did things that seemed to suggest it, like throwing away their loot from an off-screen heist, but apparently did a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> after that.
</li><li> The title characters of the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> are not once seen attending class, talking to instructors or even studying. Every university student on the planet <em>wishes</em> post-secondary school offered that much free time. This is lampshaded in the final episode when Brody remarks how it feels like he hasn't set foot in a classroom or opened a textbook even once the entire semester.
</li><li> Variation with occasional cameo The Huntsman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>, a superhero (complete with rousing intro) who genuinely wants to act the part. Problem is, for some reason there's never a problem that requires his abilities, and he's invariably reduced to stomping off in a huff and cursing "<em>Darn</em> the luck!". He's more accurately described as a Pirate Who Doesn't <em>Get To</em> Do Anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Orpheus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">by trade A NECROMANCER!</a>, yet is never seen actually raising anyone from the dead (apart from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an attempt at resurrecting Hank and Dean</span>). What he actually <em>does</em> appears to be random magic and protecting the fabric of the universe from the forces of chaos. Lampshaded in Season 4, where 21 tries to get him to actually bring someone back from the dead, and Orpheus explains that he's really just your standard magic-user, but he believes that names like "wizard" or "magician" have been tainted by pop culture, while "necromancer" still has a bit of cred left.
</li><li> Then there's Billy and Pete. On paper, they run a scientific organization named Conjectural Technologies; in practice, their main revenue stream appears to be mooching off the Ventures. Even within the organization, Billy tends to be the one who tries to organize projects, while Pete sits on the couch and plays videogames.
<div class="indent"><strong>Billy Whalin:</strong> We don't need much room for what we do, and that's why we can't pay you that much. Because we don't do that much. <br/><strong>Pete White:</strong> We actually don't do anything.
</div></li><li> An early episode also had literal pirates who were stranded in a forest of sargassum kelp and, aside from using (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">fake</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostPirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostPirate">Ghost Pirate</a> tactics to commandeer passing cargo ships (which there don't seem to be many of in the Bermuda Triangle) they really don't do much of anything at all. This is appended when they foolishly try to hijack Doctor Venture's X-2 hydrofoil, and Brock burns down their ship. The Pirate Captain returns as a recurring character, but as his pirating days are behind him, he now mostly works for various branches of Venture in security. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">everyone still calls him "the Pirate Captain."</a>

Post-movie episodes reveal exactly why Plankton's restaurant never has any customers: because it serves chum. Said chum has been shown to be extremely foul, making people vomit and forcing one guy to get his stomach pumped. In addition, Mr. Krabs is shown to actively sabotage Plankton's business, either out of spite, to monopolize Bikini Bottom's fast food industry, or both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Glenn Quagmire was said to be a pilot in early episodes. It wasn't until "Dammit Janet!" that we see him in his uniform, and in "Airport '07" that we actually got to see him do his job (although he was seen returning from a flight in "The Thin White Line").
</li><li> On that note, just how often did you see Cleveland at the deli that he <em>owned</em>? This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Lois in the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, when the characters learn that Cleveland is leaving Quahog, she asks him who will run "that deli you never work at".
</li><li> Peter zigzags with this trope. His first job was part of an assembly line in a toy factory, which averted this trope, as he was shown at that job all the time. After getting fired, he became a fisherman, and since then he has worked for the Pawtucket Patriot beer brewery, neither of which he was ever seen doing much of.
</li><li> When was the last time we saw Lois give piano lessons?
</li><li> A deliberate example from Mayor West:

It's ostensibly a 1930s version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArseneLupin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArseneLupin">Arsène Lupin</a>. He's hunted by police in every country in the world. Other criminals try to pin their crimes on him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Velma seems to be the only character who actually does anything school-related, even though they're allegedly all meddling <em>kids</em>. And even she's more likely to have a winning display at a science fair than to actually do something as routine as, say, attend a lecture.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> by Fred's dad, the mayor of Crystal Cove, who we never really see doing anything other than try to mess with the gang's mystery solving, up to this point:
<div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> Dad? What are you doing here? <br/><strong>Mayor Jones:</strong> My job as mayor! (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a></em>) Or at least what I interpret that to be.

Episodes from the first few seasons often focused on Homer Simpson's job as an (incompetent) tech and safety inspector at the nuclear power plant. In later seasons, he's seldom if ever shown working there (lampshaded in several episodes where Lenny and Carl ask him if he even goes to work anymore when they run into him). Even when we do see him at the plant, it seems to consist solely of lounging around at his workstation or going on break and eating donuts. This one is, admittedly, somewhat justified: Homer is a safety inspector, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">in a plant riddled with health and safety violations</a> and run by a notoriously corrupt CEO. He'd probably have been fired long ago if he tried to actually do his job (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E9HOMR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E9HOMR">and the one time he did, he put everyone in the plant out of work</a>).

They call themselves pirates, but they're just kids who want to have a good time. However, while they may be the page image, this was heavily changed for the program's fourth season, <em>Captain Jake and the Neverland Pirates</em>, which has a much greater focus on action-adventure, including elements such as Jake engaging in actual swordplay and facing off against real dangerous villains. The program's specials also tended to be much more action-adventure oriented, even before the revamp. They still don't engage in any piracy, which the dictionary says is what makes one a pirate, but "Neverland Swashbucklers" admittedly doesn't have the same ring to it.
</li><li> Kwazii Cat of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOctonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOctonauts">The Octonauts</a></em> constantly talks up his history as a pirate, but while he did spend time sailing on the ocean, the other activities he engaged in appear to consist mostly of telling sea stories and a little bit of treasure hunting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pinkie works at a local bakery but is only seen baking a handful of times over the course of the series, and more often than not it's for personal reasons rather than business. It might be that she gets all her work done in the fairly early morning, as a bakery well might, before the adventures. It's actually more likely that she works as a party planner, which she is seen doing quite a bit in the show.
</li><li> Some of the comics have shown that Princess Celestia does very little actual governance, and suggest that the role of a Princess in Equestria might simply be using their power and immortality to counter the more powerful evils of the world as well as ceremonial figurehead duties in peace.
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle gets promoted to princess at the end of the third season. The first episode of the next season briefly makes the point that this means she's in charge and has responsibility — ponies come to her for orders in the absence of the higher-ranking princesses — but she spends the rest of the season doing almost no princessy duties. The matter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1">"Twilight's Kingdom Part 1"</a>, Twilight spending much of the episode lamenting that her role as a princess is largely ceremonial.

</div><ul><li> Even prior to this, she lived in a library and was presumably Ponyville's librarian. The few times anyone actually asked for a book, they asked her less as a librarian and more as a friend. In <em>Read it and Weep</em>, she does give Rainbow a book... but it's from the hospital's collection, not the library's. When Rainbow wants to read the rest of the series, she borrows from Twilight's <em>personal</em> collection, rather than the library's.
</li></ul></li><li> Part 2 ends with her getting the title "Princess of Friendship", which seems to consist of doing about the same kinds of things she was doing before becoming royalty, except with a palace instead of a library and occasionally going out on specific quests. At least she's doing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">something</a></em> — you could say she doesn't do what princesses do, except that it's not like they're actually expected to do anything much. She still doesn't seem to do any ruling.
</li><li> This is actually addressed in the Season 8 premiere when Twilight Sparkle decides on a whim to start a school staffed by herself and her friends. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Chancellor Neighsay</a> raises the salient point that teaching is a full-time job and asks how Twilight can possibly expect to do it <em>and</em> her royal duties, and Twilight simply shrugs the concern off without even thinking it will be an issue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It becomes exactly that in the finale where she's forced to leave her school practically unguarded to do her royal duties, allowing Cozy Glow to usurp control and come so close to victory that it takes a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> to stop her.</span>

<ul><li> When the main character becomes a "Pirate King" by killing the previous captain, he quickly alienates the crew by turning them into this: not only do they stop going out and raiding people, but the one time they did, they let the fishermen go and didn't take anything because Archer didn't want to doom a working-class sailor to bankruptcy. Combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> personality, a mutiny quickly ensues.
</li><li> There's also Pam, before she became a spy. Pam was supposed to be the HR manager, but the only time you ever see her doing any HR work is during the first few episodes, where Archer beats her with her dolphin puppet, and also once creating an employee evaluation questionnaire. Even though dealing with sexual harassment complaints against Archer is supposed to be the body of her work, you never actually see her confronting him, and Mallory does a lot of things that you'd expect the HR person to do. It's probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">good idea writing-wise</a> because it would be annoying if another character (besides Lana) was constantly referencing the unprofessionalism of ISIS and also because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Pam</a> is usually doing a lot more interesting things than HR.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates">Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates</a></em>. All of Hook's Pirates are very eager to do some plundering and often talk about heading towards the Spanish main, but Captain Hook refuses to leave Neverland until he has dealt with Peter Pan, resulting in some very eager real Pirates that have nothing to do but act like stereotypical pirates who don't do anything.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LeapFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LeapFrog">Leapfrog: Numbers Ahoy</a></em>, the villain is a pirate. What makes him a villain, though, isn't anything resembling or labeled as piracy, but what he does on the side: kidnapping fish and keeping them in the hold of his ship. He's not shown to do anything else, and it's revealed that his fish-napping is part of a hobby separate from his "job" as a pirate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>: Throughout the series, Clay refers to his "stinking dead-end job" but he is never seen doing it. In fact the audience, and even his own son, doesn't even know what it is until the penultimate episode of the series when Orel goes to talk to the mayor and finds out that it's his dad.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">The three main pirates</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtleIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtleIsland">Turtle Island</a></em> are basically good literal examples, in the sense that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">certain reasons</a> for doing this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisGang">Yogi's Gang</a></em>: The Envy Brothers are said to be trapezists but they're never seen performing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewSchool">The Emperor's New School</a></em>: Yzma is Kuzco's advisor but doesn't give him any advice through the series because she's under the impression that, since Kuzco must graduate in order to become Emperor, she doesn't have to do her job until then. She's told otherwise by a board of people in charge of reviewing her work in "Take My Advice".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> wears <em>two</em> variations of a sailor outfit, but we seldom see him doing duties connected to the Navy. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> lampshaded this in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> review stating that Donald's been in the Army, a Boy Scout and even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">Nazi</a> but never a sailor. This gets lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013">Mickey Mouse (2013)</a></em> revealing that Daisy bought him his sailor suit and he knows nothing about sailing ships even though Daisy seems convinced that he does for some reason.
</li><li> The so-called "ninjas" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ninjago">Ninjago</a></em> don't do much in the way of acting as spies (as ninjas are wont to do), instead taming powerful dragons and battling undead enemies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">All while wearing extremely bright clothing.</a>

</li><li> In <em>Hoze Houndz</em>, our titular anthro dogs barely do any fire fighting activites at all despite the title.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A literal example of this trope: If the following <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/ap-impact-party-seems-over-somali-pirates-201115675.html">article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is to be believed, the Somali pirates are now doing other things to pass the time due to better ship security and international naval patrols.
</li><li> The Barbary Pirates. They did get their start with actual piracy by raiding Christian vessels and ports, but then they realized they could make their operation much more profitable by running a protection racket, effectively becoming something akin to the mafia — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">with seafaring vessels</a>. The entire Mediterranean Sea was their stomping ground, and many countries were all too willing to pay up just to keep the pirates from giving them trouble for defaulting on their protection money, until a certain new country known as the United States decided they'd have none of it and brought in their shiny new navy.
</li><li> In summer of 2010, 10 Russian spies were caught in America. However these aren't your badass Cold War Russians, as these spies were hanging around in Hoboken and raising families in suburbia. Though the spies were doing all sorts of James Bondian things, like bag switch offs and burying messages, there isn't any evidence that any of their information was of actual value. Most embarrassing are <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/Suspected-Russian-Spy-Anna-Chapman/ss/events/us/062910annachapman">the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/5575882/the-facebook-adventures-of-accused-russian-spy-mikhail-semenko">photos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the spies. The first of these were posted on <em>Facebook.</em>
</li><li> "Do-nothing Congress" is a common phrase in American politics, usually used by Presidents, presidential candidates or the minority party in Congress; the charge was most famously levied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> at the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_United_States_Congress">80th Congress<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1948 and by the Democrats against the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/109th_United_States_Congress">109th Congress<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 2006. Often it's an empty talking point that means "This Congress has done nothing I asked them to do," but occasionally it's used accurately. When the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives is closely divided between parties (and sometimes even when it's not), it's entirely possible that very few substantial bills will get passed. Likewise, when one political party strongly dominates the presidency and one house of Congress, the remaining house will very rarely get anything done, and even then only grudgingly.
<ul><li> Whether or not Congress <em>does</em> do anything is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">contentious issue</a> and "do-nothing" can be a desirable outcome depending on the issues on the table, party affiliation, philosophy (federalist vs. anti-federalist), etc.; moreover, "do-nothing" is usually used only in the context of passing legislation. Congress is technically responsible for overseeing the executive branch and crafting legislation, but as time has gone by representatives have created numerous subcommittees and it's now difficult to tell what Congress <em>isn't</em> responsible for, meaning that individual representatives may be doing quite a bit while the Congress itself does no legislating whatsoever.
<ul><li> President Obama has joked on several occasions about this subject during White House Correspondent Dinners
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>I want to especially thank all the Members (of Congress) who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight.</em> - WHCD 2012
</div><div class="indent"> <em>My charm offensive has helped me learn some interesting things about whats going on in Congress. It turns out absolutely nothing."</em> - WHCD 2013
</div></li><li> Presidents often receive a similar rap, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore">Michael Moore</a>'s allegation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> spent most of his first term on vacation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7q1m3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7q1m3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7q1m3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He did in fact spend a little over 1/3 of presidency "on vacation", in the sense of being away from the White House for reasons other than official business (ie not counting diplomatic trips, visits to military bases, etc), which is significantly longer than any other President for which records of such things exist. That doesn't, however, necessarily mean he was actually off the job; for example there were many occasions of foreign leaders making official trips to visit <em>him</em> while Bush was at his vacation home, and modern communication technology means the President of the United States can do most of his job from anywhere on Earth.</span> or Republicans' criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s golfing, vacations and parties during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill crisis. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> was similarly portrayed as a golfer-in-chief. Current President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> is often accused of spending more time lashing out at people who criticize him via Twitter than doing any presidential activities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8znam');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8znam" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8znam');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an accusation supported by his constant stream of tweets and the fact that he has taken more vacation days than the previous three presidents <em>combined</em></span>.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>, rules at Oxford and Cambridge were so lax thirty years ago that students could (and many did) get away with going to almost no lectures or tutorials their entire four years there. And not just the students, either: <em>professors</em> were at least rumored to get away with this.
<ul><li> Colleges in Japan are difficult to get into (a fact well-known to any Western anime fan), but are almost equally difficult to be thrown <em>out</em> of, so that many Japanese see their college "student" years as a nice break between the stress of studying for entrance exams and later employment.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a long list of people known as "Celebutante" who have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousForBeingFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousForBeingFamous">famous for no real reason</a> (actor, singer, musician, writer, model, etc., although they might dabble in these after the fact). They become famous for any number of reasons (reality shows, marrying a celebrity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">sex tapes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonAndKatePlusEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonAndKatePlusEight">churning out babies</a>, etc.) who are able to get by on "appearance fees" for club appearances and the like.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> have drifted into being Pirates Who Don't Do Anything in real life. Jamie Hyneman's actual business is <em>M5 Studios</em>, and he and his crew worked for years as very successful special-effects artists and product modelers. Jamie has since admitted in interviews that M5's activity has been declining since MythBusters hit it big, because companies that would have hired them don't want their products taking a backseat to the show's schedule, which as the show chugs on through ever larger projects is exactly what has happened.
</li><li> There was a period from 2009-2012 where a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> teams would "start and park" - they would show up at the track and qualify for the race, only to retire after just a handful of laps and collect the prize money for the bottom finishing positions. This practice eventually spread to pretty much any team that wasn't locked into the top 35 in owner points, the line above which teams were given an automatic starting spot regardless of qualifying speed. This may be why, in 2013, NASCAR switched back an older qualifying format that gave spots to the 36 fastest cars plus a handful of spots for owner points, while also reducing the prize money for the bottom finishing positions to the point where the start and park was no longer economically feasible for even small, mostly unsponsored teams. In 2016, NASCAR hit the nail on the head further by reducing the field for Sprint Cup races to 40 drivers from 43, and by replacing the top 35 rule with a new "charter" system, in which 36 teams that have participated full-time for the past three seasons were awarded "charters" that give them automatic qualification for all races.
</li><li> The Westboro Baptist Church spend most of their time picketing everything from other churches to <em>soldiers' funerals</em>, and they seem to rarely, if ever, do actual sermons or masses or anything.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton">Isaac Newton</a> was made Warden of the Royal Mint, the position was a pure example of this trope, being a sinecure given to people in the good graces of the government like Newton (to the point that his appointment letter even explicitly said the position "has not too much business to require more attendance than [Newton] can spare"). Much to the surprise of everyone, Newton turned out to be a real aversion, with the great scientist modernizing and rationalizing the operation of the Mint, while developing a network of informants to bring down a criminal mastermind forger. In fact, his work at the Mint is what got Newton a knighthood, not his scientific work.
</li><li> A German chapter of the Mongols Motorcycle Club is at best <em>nominally</em> an "outlaw motorcycle club", as it is more of a crime syndicate that cashed in on the United States-based biker gang's notoriety rather than a typical band of marauding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">bikers</a>. Mongols MC Bremen members <em>drive around in cars</em>, and in an ironic twist, the gang's former president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">accidentally killed himself</a> whilst trying to ride a motorcycle.
</li><li> The furlough schemes introduced in various countries during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic have meant that millions of people have continued to be officially employed, and earning money, without doing any work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You're embodying this trope right now if you're reading this at work.</a>
