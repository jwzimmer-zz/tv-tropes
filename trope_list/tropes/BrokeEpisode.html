<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> had an episode like this, also highlighting the fact most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloaders">Pretty Freeloaders</a> had no visible means of support. Further played around with in <em>Tenchi Universe</em> where Kiyone and Mihoshi have to work multiple part time jobs just to afford to stay on Earth, and later in the same series where the group is forced to open a bar in Kiyone's space cruiser just to raise money for fuel, all while on the run as the most wanted criminals in the universe.
<ul><li> This may however be justifiable, given that all of the characters who come from off-Earth would possess mainly currency that Earth governments would not recognize. Kiyone and Mihoshi's Galaxy Police salaries, then, would be unspendable on Earth, while Tenchi's family would have only Japanese yen, not recognized in the rest of the galaxy.
</li><li> This happens in one episode of <em>Tenchi in Tokyo</em>, in which the girls head out to Tokyo with meager amounts of money to work there. By the end of the episode, it was Sasami who made the most money, thanks to a street act she performed with Ryo-Ohki.
</li><li> And <em>further</em> played with in the manga series, especially volume 9 of the first (specifically titled "The Quest for More Money"), where the cast explicitly sails off for a treasure hunt. Stow away those questions about your first true love, there's gold in them thar planets! (Note that it was Tenchi and the girls who were out of money. Tenchi's father was in no way broke, but he was out of town and they don't have access to his money. Tenchi, naturally, vetoed Washu's suggestion of hacking into the bank records and giving themselves money.)
<ul><li> The volume ended with no actual money being acquired on the quest (in fact, they <em>lost</em> money in the process)...but then there's a final scene showing that Emperor Azusa sent Ayeka a container filled with gold bars. So many that Yosho says it would crash Earth's gold market if released into circulation.
</li></ul></li><li> A series of <em>yonkoma</em> released in the "Sasami Stories" book had a storyline of Noboyuki going broke due to a lack of construction. The gang attempts different methods <em>before</em> Washu opts to just hack the bank account and toss money in.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>'s characters are frequently wanting for money and especially food, despite their occasional lucrative bounties. Faye was the worst offender, constantly rummaging the ship for the other character's stashes of food or valuables. She also had a habit of gambling away her bounties at the track as soon as she cashed them in.
<ul><li> Almost every episode was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episode</a>. What keeps this show from the definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a> was that they never seemed to have any shortages of bullets, cigarettes, or oxygen, commodities that must surely have been pricey for an interplanetary lifestyle.
<ul><li> It's even mentioned in one episode by Spike that bounty hunting is a lousy way to live, since depending on the funds from hunting people down is no way to make a reliable living. Some weeks may be great, but other times there may be a dry spell of people to pick up and turn in. Not only that, but the show also showed that sometimes due to the high risk nature of their "business," sometimes the bounties didn't live long enough to BE cashed in. In addition, most of the time we just saw Spike and his crew go after the BIG bounties, the ones that would put them on easy street. When we did see Spike and his crew deal with minor criminals, the payday was quite modest.
</li><li> It's even mentioned in one episode that there are also "costs" to being a bounty hunter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">paying off all the collateral damage done.</span>
</li><li> To be precise, it was basically a rule of the show that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">the crew would never collect a significant bounty. Ever</a></span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> is almost as much about Broke Episodes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>. Like with Cowboy Bebop, most of the money is spent on the upkeep of their spaceship, such as docking fees, repairs and ammunition. It does <em>not</em> help that Gene's ego refuses to let him accept jobs unless they're suitably dramatic or high-paying enough.
<ul><li> Hilariously enforced at the end of one episode that ended with them bringing home a treasure trove of Dragonite. Unfortunately is was low grade, and the money received from it was just enough to cover the cost of damages and other expenditures for their ship, leaving them right back where they started.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the three major episode situations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a>,</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>. Usually the responsibility for getting money/food/other necessary items fell on Jin; Mugen and Fuu forced him to pawn his swords at least twice, and his <em>glasses</em> once.
</li><li> The Paper Sisters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die</a></em> were frequently broke, especially in the manga. This is because they would spend all of their food money on books. If only there were some way to make money out of paper...
<ul><li> Their powers over paper don't include being able to print things on it however. On the other hand if you've seen the OVA, there are interesting things done with actual paper money...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em>: Several episodes are dedicated to showing how the SVU2 manages during budget cuts, or simply due to the costly expenses of repairing and maintaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">the Labors.</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNextGenerationPatlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNextGenerationPatlabor">The Next Generation</a></em> takes this to its logical conclusion, by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">SVU1 was eventually disbanded, after the top brass of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">it was too costly to support both Labor divisions</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhantomQuestCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhantomQuestCorp">Phantom Quest Corp.</a></em>: In the fourth Incident File, the members of Phantom Quest end up having to take part-time jobs, just to get by, thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion">the Hadja</a></span> stealing all of their clients.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover">Honey and Clover</a></em> could be called one big broke series for some of the characters. As is life for people at college.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>: in episode 14, where everyone in the apartments has to provide 10,000 yen for bills. Also to a lesser degree in episode 6 where Shinobu and Motoko have to fund their 'rescue mission' by doing odd jobs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em> has Nobue often seeking a job to make money for cigarettes, although she is hardly above stealing yen from her younger sister, blatantly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em>: Abel, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">disorganized person that he normally is</a>, never has enough money when he needs it.
<ul><li> He states at least once during the series that this is because of a vow of poverty he took. He is not allowed to have more than a few coins at a time. He is after all a Catholic priest...though given that he's a field operative for the Vatican one would think he should have access to an expense account (which wouldn't be <em>his</em> money, but rather the Church's) to handle official business.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> are <strong>constantly</strong> broke to the point of showering in fountains and mooching food from vagrants. If they make an insane amount of money on a job, expect them to lose it all almost immediately. If they have a little left over, expect their car to get towed.
</li><li> Every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers">Nerima Daikon Brothers</a></em> focuses on the efforts of the title trio to get some easy cash, usually by stealing it from some con artist or other crooked character. By the end of the episode, the money was gone, either lost to the winds or confiscated by the mark's original victims.
</li><li> While never exactly the theme of the episode, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> plots involving Lina and company doing some service for money were common. Given their eating habits which often amount to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">two of everything on the menu, please</a>" <em>per meal</em>, <em><strong>per person</strong></em>, Lina's mercenary nature regarding being paid for doing almost anything inconvenient to her is potentially explainable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">A lampshade was hung</a> on this in the third series, TRY, where despite the fact that the entire group has enough money for their meal, Filia is the only one with local currency, hence her tearful exit leaving them unable to pay for their meal. Further referenced later in the series when they're unable to pay for something and Filia notes that if they didn't eat so much, they'd <em>have</em> money. There is also a brief point where Lina orders an even more extravagant amount of food than normal and tells the restaurant to charge everything to Amelia, who is outraged at the rudeness of eating on another person's credit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier">Grenadier</a></em>, Rushuna and Yatchan are often broke and hungry, and in one episode resort to performing entertaining stunts in the street for money, with little success.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> manages some of the most amusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> and subversion of this. At one point two minor characters are shown taking jobs at a convenience store to get by, ducking the manager to rush out and assist the heroes in their battle. Later, several of the incredibly powerful cast manage to find reason to let their hair down and do things like join in a little kids' soccer game, bake cakes under the direction of an expert chef ghost, etc. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> Renji Abarai, being a freeloader at the Urahara shop, is frequently pushed into helping with the menial tasks associated with such an establishment. (Ironically, despite being designated a "freeloader", it appears that for the duration of his stay Renji does more work than the actual employees.)
</li><li> The two sisters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari">Binbou Shimai Monogatari</a></em> are usually broke or pretty nearly so, which forms the subject of a lot of episodes. In fact, the entire series can be described as a "Broke Series".
<ul><li> The title actually translates to something close to: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">story of impoverished sisters</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> Train's group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> never have enough money to pay for a halfway decent meal (mooching off of the waitress' kindness of giving them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogFoodDiet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogFoodDiet">bread crusts</a>). And if they do get millions from a particularly good sweep, Train uses it up on all the damages he causes or on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">vast amount of food he eats</a>.
</li><li> The entire plot of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamadaTarouMonagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamadaTarouMonagatari">Yamada Tarou Monagatari</a></em> (<em>Yamada Tarou's Story</em>) revolves around the titular character's sunny outlook on life despite abject poverty that forces him to work multiple part-time jobs to support his mother and many younger siblings. He's also incredibly smart and attends a prestigious school on a full scholarship, though he has to be convinced to pursue higher education despite his obvious talents because he worries what his family will do without him around.
</li><li> Makino Tsukushi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em> often seems to be the only sane member of her family, and usually has to step in to solve her family's financial woes (often brought on by her nitwit father) by getting part-time jobs. She tells her family that she would gladly attend a school OTHER than the monumentally expensive Eitoku (which she loathes), but they refuse because it's so prestigious and makes them look good in addition to giving her greater opportunities for the future.
<ul><li> Despite eventually dating the richest guy in Japan (Domyouji Tsukasa) and pal-ing around with his uber-rich clique (The Flower Four), Makino routinely refuses to request their financial support. This doesn't stop them from helping her out in a pinch, though.

<ul><li> But it does- offscreen. When Luffy complains how the crew doesn't have much money when the White Berets' fines prove too much for them to afford with the little they have left, their immediate response is to show him the food bill.

</li><li> The earliest chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah!

The solution: having divine forces on your side helps. It's a slight subversion in that the protagonists don't get money (although Keichii eventually gets a good mechanic job much further into the series), but they do get good housing for free.

Curiously, the millionaire was Cornelius Van Lunt in one of his earliest appearances.

However, New York gives them Avengers Mansion as thanks and, thanks to Johnny Storm getting a monetary windfall, their problems are solved easily.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> get most of their money from a) licensing and merchandise or b) Reed's patents. When either of these get negatively impacted by bad PR, lawsuits, massive destruction, or whatever other crap gets thrown at them this year, they usually have a huge scramble, since they pour all their money into scientific research and building interdimensional stardrives/soul jars made of pocket universes/robotic toasters, not to mention a ridiculous amount of defense mechanisms; and repossession, etc, of their junk is as catastrophic as any supervillain attack.
<ul><li> The first issue with this plot is Fantastic Four vol 1 #9 (December, 1962). The leader of the team, Reed Richards, invested the team's money on the stock market and managed to lose everything. The team is forced to declare bankruptcy, and to liquidate their assets just to pay their creditors. They are broke and hopeless, until a mysterious benefactor offers them a lucrative job in his company.

He actually places the team through many dangerous situations for his own amusement. After having his sadistic fun with them, Namor pays them a salary large enough to restore them to their relatively wealthy lifestyle. (The story establishes that Namor invested his wealth from Atlantis in buying companies and film studios in Los Angeles. He can afford to be generous. )
</li></ul></li><li> A few Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Uncle Scrooge</a> stories suggests that Scrooge would be flat broke if the Beagle Boys, or some other cataclysm, successfully managed to deprive him of all of his cash money. For this to sound plausible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">you have to ignore the fact that he'd still own thousands of shops, factories, and mines</a>.
<ul><li> Actually, he usually only claims of being broke when that happens, in order to guilt-trip Donald into helping him (and offering him some free meals). When his business doesn't go <em>perfectly</em> right (temporary decrease of <em>0.01% in profits</em>, for example) he even claims he's going to become broke... <em>in a few centuries' time</em>. It's more about his personality than about being broke at all.
</li><li> By the time of the Don Rosa comics, Scrooge's giant money bin filled with cash — the Beagle Boys' favorite target — contains only the money that Scrooge earned <em>personally</em>. While this makes significantly more sense, it does mean that in subsequent comic stories Scrooge's personal position is never really in any danger.

Gina's rival Pennyn is convinced to loan Gina the money she needs, <em>if</em> she will cover Penny's niece's fast food job for a day.

Thankfully, he's able to blackmail the loan shark into not only calling off the debt, but also out of several thousand pounds extra.
<ul><li> The third series episode "Amy and Amiability" sees Edmund out of money and facing a mountain of bills. He tries his usual fix of asking Prince George for a raise, only to learn the prince is also broke thanks to gambling debts. A plan is hatched to marry George off to the daughter of a wealthy industrialist but it turns out they don't have any money either.

In the end it's subverted; her daughter Saffron reveals that she's still quite wealthy even without the money from her exes, and she merely let her think she was poor to teach her a lesson.
