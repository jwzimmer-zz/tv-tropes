</div></div><p>Say a character finds out about a paranormal phenomenon, or a sinister conspiracy. There wouldn't be much of a plot left if they could just call the police and let them take care of it.
</p><p>In these cases, heroes will simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">talk like stereotypical paranoid schizophrenics</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><ol><li> They will continually repeat a bizarre claim in a panicked voice.
</li><li> They will avoid mentioning what led them to believe it in the first place.
</li><li> They will be vague on details.
</li><li> They will never consider sticking to the provable parts of the story for the time being.
</li><li> Most important, they will be stunned and angry that anyone would find their claim implausible, regardless of how implausible it would be even if they <em>weren't</em> completely flushing any credibility they might otherwise have down the toilet in their method of persuasion.
</li><li> In extreme cases, they may respond to skepticism by wondering out loud if the disbeliever is "in on it" or "one of Them." And if anyone tries to calm them down, rather than taking a few deep breaths, sitting down for a moment, and coming back to the problem in a calmer fashion, they will immediately violently lash out, thus prompting the immediate summoning of the nearest security guards to have them ejected from the premises.

</p><p>What's more, this will give the heroes a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a> or being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader">Windmill Crusaders</a>, making it even harder for them to get anyone to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMereWindmill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMereWindmill">the threat is real</a>. Of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfMortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfMortality">senseless deaths</a> of the skeptics is often seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">karmic comeuppance</a> in favor of the hero, even if it <em>was</em> the heroes' fault they aren't believed in the first place.
</p><p>The other side of this trope is that, if the person making the claim sounds crazy, the listener will dismiss them to the point of <em>going out of their way to dismiss them</em>, no matter how simple it would be to investigate. When someone is screaming "<span class="asscaps">THERE IS AN ALIEN DIRECTLY BEHIND YOU WHICH IS ABOUT TO EAT YOU YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME I TELL YOU!</span>", you can be assured that the listener will <em>not</em> turn around; they will, in fact, <em>stubbornly and strenuously refuse to</em> turn around.

Given that Fluttershy does not in any way look like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mythical flying creature the Pegasi know as "buzzies"</span> and generally take about as seriously as we do UFO sightings, Rainbow Dash simply assumes that Fluttershy has gone a bit crazy under the stress of being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">unfavorite daughter</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">dysfunctional family</a>.

<ul><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenLittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenLittle">Chicken Little</a></em> uses this one a lot. Chicken Little's flabbergasted babbling as he attempts to explain himself isn't exactly helped by his own father apologizing for his "craziness" to the townspeople.
</li><li> The eponymous character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> attempts to contact the police and explain that her parents were kidnapped, but once she gets to the part about the Other Mother, they shrug it off. Admittedly, she could have at least convinced them that her parents really were missing, but that doesn't mean they could do anything constructive. She also tells Wybie what's going on, but she doesn't try very hard to convince him, and is more venting at him than trying to explain anything. (Also somewhat justified by Wybie being rather a smart-arse.) She loses all credibility (despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">telling the complete truth</a>) when she starts throwing shoes at him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> when Maurice raves to the dismissive townsfolk about the beast who imprisoned his daughter Belle.

And yet, the cops make no connection and just laugh each one out of the room.
</li><li> This seems to be somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> for Woody in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>, often to the point he tends to quote this trope almost verbatim:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory1">Toy Story</a></em>: When he accidentally knocks Buzz out the window, Woody tries to convince the other toys it was just that: an accident. Unfortunately, Woody's rampant jealousy of Buzz has led Mr. Potato Head to convince the others to tear the cowboy apart. It repeats twice when Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house (not helped by the fact he was trying to use Buzz's arm to convince the others to let him over, seeing as Buzz was undergoing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>), then again when he throws RC out the moving van to rescue Buzz from Scud.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2">Toy Story 2</a></em>: When Woody learns he's being donated to a toy museum in Japan, he is adamant to leave immediately to get back to Andy, but the other toys think that, because of his damaged arm, Andy is mistreating him, and he's better off going to the museum.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">Toy Story 3</a></em>: Andy's toys (sans Woody) accidentally get thrown out on the curb on trash day, and think Andy threw them away. As such, they decide to donate themselves to Sunnyside Daycare, despite Woody's insistence that Any was trying to put them in the attic. Since Woody was the only one of the toys not to be in that trash bag, they refuse to believe him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">Toy Story 4</a></em>: After Woody tries to explain how Bonnie's newest toy, Forky, is important to her, the rest of the toys think he's crazy, as he had just spent the last few weeks not getting played with, and assume his actions are him trying to make himself feel useful.

<ul><li> Several Abbott and Costello films involve Costello's character stumbling upon a dead body, only for the murderer to move the dead body before Costello can bring Abbott's character into the room to see the dead guy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>, Peter tries to convince Captain Stacy that Dr. Connors is the Lizard with nothing but his say-so to back it up. Stacy has him removed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but does ask one of his officers to look into it</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanDreamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanDreamer">American Dreamer</a></em>, Alan tries to explain things to the police, but he gives poor context for the situation, making the woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">who thinks she's an adventure novel heroine</a> look credible.
</li><li> Somewhat reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em>, as it's one of the walking corpses who's trying to convince the living protagonist, who dismisses them as a hallucination.
<dl><dd><div class="indent">"Goddammit, David, <em>please</em> believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time here."
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> Once he <em>does</em> come to accept dead Jack's claims, David accosts a London bobby and declares he's the one who killed several people last night. The fact that Alex is right there contradicting his claims doesn't help his effort to convince the bobby to lock him up, nor does his recourse to cussing and insulting prominent U.K. figures when the policeman just tells him to move alone.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BewareTheBlob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BewareTheBlob">Beware! The Blob</a></em>, the female lead witnesses the eponymous monster's first two victims, then almost becomes a victim herself. When it comes time to alert the public, the most coherent thing she can utter is "It came <em>after</em> us; it came <em>after</em> us!" She does get a little better by the end of the film; but by this time, as per the dictates of the trope, her credibility is done gone shot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a></em>, Frances suspects that Caligari and Cesare are responsible for the murder of Allan, a point he argues very poorly to the police, although justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's batshit insane</span>.
</li><li> Basically the entire plot of <em>A Cry in the Wilderness</em>, in which a father, suspecting that he might have contracted rabies, chains himself up in a barn, telling his son not to release him under any circumstances. Later he realizes that there is an imminent flood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeadCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeadCenter">The Dead Center</a></em>, Dr. Forrester briefly tries to explain what's going on to his boss, Dr. Gray.

But she won't listen because she's <em>livid</em> at him for not only secretly and illegally admitting a helpless patient, but drugging and seemingly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> assaulting</span> him as well. She's entirely justified in concern over lawsuits for the hospital and potentially ruining their careers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleJeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoubleJeopardy">Double Jeopardy</a></em>: Libby wails this verbatim when testifying in her own defense regarding her husband's murder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></em>, the hero experiences the day over and over and is hence able to see into the future. His efforts to tell his story are quite fruitless at first. Near the movie's end, he manages to get his comrades to believe him, having gained enough experience and credibility to explain the situation coherently.
</li><li> A review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty">Evan Almighty</a></em> posed the question that never seems to be answered in those kinds of movies — so Steve Carell tells his wife he's been chosen by God to recreate the Noah story and that's why all this weird stuff is happening. She doesn't believe him. Why doesn't he take her into the bathroom and show her how his beard grows back immediately when he shaves it, and so on? (Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">the movie as it is depends on characters assuming</a> that everything that happens to Evan is some kind of misguided attempt at humor he's engineered and is now refusing to let go, no matter how miserable it clearly makes him and how much he insists that it's not his fault.)
</li><li> Early in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Friday the 13th</a></em> series, "Crazy Ralph", a local vagabond, would show up to try to warn people to stay away from Crystal Lake. In the end, the only person to take him seriously is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jason Voorhees, who cuts Ralph's throat early on in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPart2">Part II</a>.</span>
</li><li> Played with in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrightNight1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrightNight1985">Fright Night (1985)</a></em>, when Charlie, convinced that his neighbor is a vampire who has been murdering local women, only tries to convince the police that his neighbor is a murderer, rather than a vampire. Sadly, when he doesn't have enough evidence, he goes right to the vampire story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em>, Jason Nesmith tries to tell his co-stars that the odd-looking fans at the convention were really aliens: "They were termites... or dalmatians!" They don't believe him at first, even when a couple of the Thermians (shapeshifted into humans) arrive. Aside from the general ranting associated with this trope, he's also unshaven and disheveled, with alcohol on his breath, and the people he's trying to convince were already pissed at him for apparently blowing them off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII">Ghostbusters II</a></em>, the Ghostbusters are institutionalized when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">try to inform everyone that the subways are filling up with malevolent slime and that a painting in the Metropolitan Art Museum is coming to life at midnight on New Year's Eve.</a> In a minor subversion, Peter is smart enough to realize that acting crazy and hysterical, as per the trope, isn't going to do anyone any good; unfortunately, the others aren't:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ray:</strong> As I explained before, we think the spirit of a 17th century Moldavian tyrant is alive and well in a painting at the Manhattan Museum of Art. <br/><strong>Psychiatrist:</strong> Uh-huh, and are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them? <br/><strong>Egon:</strong> You're wasting valuable time. He's drawing strength from a psychomagnotheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city. <br/><strong>Psychiatrist:</strong> Yes, tell me about the slime. <br/><strong>Winston:</strong> It's very potent stuff. We made a toaster dance with it. <em>[gestures to Venkman]</em> And a bathtub tried to eat his friend's baby. <br/><strong>Psychiatrist:</strong> A bathtub? <br/><strong>Venkman:</strong> Don't look at me. I think these people are completely nuts.
</div><ul><li> This is despite the fact that, in the previous movie, a giant marshmallow monster rampaged through the town. Somehow everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">believes that it was a trick</a>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the first film, when Winston asks if they are <em>seriously</em> going to tell a judge that an ancient god to going to destroy the city.
</li><li> Pops up again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016">Ghostbusters (2016)</a></em> when Erin, realising the true nature of the apocalyptic threat, tries to warn the Mayor to evacuate the city and doesn't do a very good job of it. It's partly her own fault, since she's both hysterical at the time and not the most socially competent of people to begin with, but matters aren't helped when the Mayor reacts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">with unexpectedly passionate rage</a> when she compares him to the Mayor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em>, this is what happens when the hero tries to explain the title creatures to the cops. And again in the sequel.
</li><li> Happens a lot to Nora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959">House on Haunted Hill (1959)</a></em>, who keeps seeing dead bodies and blood stains. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's part of an elaborate plot to keep her constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</span> By the time her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a>, Lance, eventually spots one of the severed heads she told everyone about, he's had it with this trope, so he grabs the head by the hair and takes it to show everyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>: As the alien ships arrive over major cities, David realizes that the weird signal he found is really a countdown to an attack. He immediately calls his ex-wife, the President's communications director, to warn her, but his out-of-breath and panicked speech (not to mention calling while the President is giving an emergency address) causes her to quickly hang up. He's a lot more calm when he goes to the White House to convince her and President Whitmore in person.
</li><li> The original ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1956" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1956">Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)</a></em> defines this trope, when the main character runs down the highway hysterically screaming at passing motorists that "They're here! You're all next!". The aliens even let him go, pointing out that no one's going to believe him anyway (and especially not if he's acting as hysterically as that). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the studio was not satisfied</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">ending on such a dark note</a>, and added a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> of the hero in a hospital telling his story to a pair of FBI agents, who don't believe him either... until a passing orderly mentions a car accident involving a truck full of strange, vegetable-like pods.
</li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMidnightMeatTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMidnightMeatTrain">The Midnight Meat Train</a></em>, where the protagonist (played by Bradley Cooper) is quite reasonable and diplomatic with the police detective, accepting that the evidence he has is not enough to convict Vinnie Jones of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>. Unfortunately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his paranoiac dedication to finding out the truth drives him crazy</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMist">The Mist</a></em>, David Drayton makes a very lame attempt to tell Norton about "the creatures in the mist". Even his companions comment this to themselves.
</li><li> Played with in the Israeli zombie comedy <em>Muralim</em>. When the hero first attempts to get in touch with the outside world, he babbles about zombies taking over the base - but then he takes a moment to think, and issues an very calm correction. What he ACTUALLY meant to say was that the base is being attacked by terrorists. Unfortunately for him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRadioDiesFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRadioDiesFirst">The Radio Dies First</a>, and neither message reaches the proper authorities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NonStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NonStop">Non-Stop</a></em>: Marks has to convince the crew as well as his bosses that he is not behind a hijacking. However, he doesn't explain himself to the passengers, for fear of provoking whoever is behind this or causing a panic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This comes to bite him when the passengers also believe he is hijacking them and decide to ambush him.

</li><li> The hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShockCorridor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShockCorridor">Shock Corridor</a></em> had himself declared insane and sent to the asylum, where he eventually fails to convince the shrink of his sanity.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers">Small Soldiers</a></em>. The main heroine is trying to call the police to help them against the attacking toys, and insists that it's not a prank call. Then she reverses herself and says that it is, "So you'll come over and arrest me, right?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">They hang up.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">The final scene of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">Soylent Green</a></em>, in which Charlton Heston's character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">desperately shouts the titular staple's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">secret ingredient</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis">is often played as this in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Parodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Parodies">parodies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">but actual scene doesn't really fit the trope.</a>
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>; when he's figured out what's going on, Kirk races into the bridge like a madman yelling about how it's a trap. Given his actions — plus the fact that he's pretty much a stowaway — Captain Pike is within seconds of having him locked up when Uhura validates Kirk's story with evidence and Spock (who has been given no reason to like Kirk) acknowledges both that Kirk's theory is logical, and Uhura's linguistic skills are beyond reproach. This plus the fact that Pike wrote his dissertation on the anomalous event Kirk is trying to prove is happening a second time gets Pike to give Kirk the benefit of the doubt. It also helped that Kirk was acting fairly calm and rational, at least compared to most people described on this page.
</li><li> At first the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TakeShelter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TakeShelter">Take Shelter</a></em> tries to hide his fears because he knows everyone will assume he's crazy.

He wakes up and, while still in pajamas and robe, heads to the airport.

Convinced his dream was a prophecy, he keeps trying to convince the passengers, crew, security and so on that the plane's going to crash and gets more and more frustrated by people not taking him seriously. In the climax, he's on the tarmac and sees a single-engine plane with a drunk pilot taxiing onto the runway, heading into the path of the airliner.

Initially, he starts off presenting his theories about why the Doctor keeps popping up in different parts of history in a calm and reasonable fashion, and presents a relatively plausible theory that she'd be likely to believe  they're all different men who are related and sharing a code name. Then, as he gets a bit carried away with having an audience, he starts getting a bit more worked up and intense, until he's convinced that Rose believes him fully and so blurts out his <em>real</em> theory (which is the truth)  that they're same man, and the Doctor is an alien travelling through time. Unfortunately for him, he hadn't quite won Rose over before this, who leaves believing that he's a nutcase.

Later on, during the eruption, she tries to warn fleeing residents not to go to the beach (where the ash cloud will be lethal), but no one listens.

Graham, meanwhile, averts it while getting information from his fellow bus drivers, by not mentioning he's looking for aliens when asking if they've seen anything unusual.

<ul><li> Played straight in season 2 since the government covered up what happened in season 1 and Molly suffered a nervous breakdown due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> John's death and Ethan's seizure by the government</span>. She is committed to a "rest home" and her efforts to convince people that she is sane quickly devolve into this trope.

For obvious reasons, she thinks he's delusional, and he can't get her to the hospital until after she collapses.
<ul><li> The next season he gets to try this again as a case of Magical Amnesia has wiped Juliet's memory of the event. This time he is much calmer, and makes sure that he can back up his claims by actually having some friendly Wesen transform into their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> in front of her.

Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">it doesn't help</a>.
</li><li> Played absolutely straight in season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland">Homeland</a></em> when Carrie goes to Brody's house and, in the most wild-eyed, rambling manner possible, tries to convince his wife and daughter that he's a terrorist.

Having been presumed dead for fifteen years, he returns to New York intending to reclaim his share of his father's megacorporation. He starts by walking into headquarters looking like a hobo and asking to see the CEO. When they don't let him, he breaks into the CEO's office by attacking the guards. Once he gets there and sees childhood acquaintances Ward and Joy, he repeatedly claims to be Danny without providing any proof and is shocked that they don't believe him. He sneaks into Joy's house and admits it to her face, then breaks into Ward's car and purposely nearly crashes it in anger. When he's put in a mental asylum, he violently lashes out on multiple occasions and insists on telling everyone he's spent the last fifteen years in an extra-dimensional land and has magical powers in his fist. On occasion he sees the potential value of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay">speaking about memories that only he would have,</a> but he ignores plenty of good opportunities to do this (especially when speaking with Joy and Ward), preferring instead to repeat ridiculous sounding claims and attack people when they don't believe him.
</li><li> Often happens to the marks on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> as they try in vain to get the authorities to believe that they were set up by an elite team of con artists.
<ul><li> In "The Very Big Bird Job", corrupt executive Romer calmly explains to the FBI that he wasn't fleeing the country to avoid insider trading charges and causing a deadly crash. Rather, he believed he was flying the Spruce Goose to save it from Iranians out to steal 70-year old stealth technology invented by Howard Hughes. Their expressions say it all.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheListener" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheListener">The Listener</a></em> Toby is unable to explain how he can read minds and thus simply insists others have to trust him on things like knowing when a crime is to be committed or a secret someone has. When he meets police detective Michelle in the season season, Toby decides the only way to avoid all this is to tell her the truth and then reads her mind, answering her questions verbally until Michelle believes him.
</li><li> This is the title character's usual tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>. He never has any proof, because obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>, and so it never works. You'd think he'd learn after a few tries. Or alternatively, you'd think the other characters would learn that no matter how insane Merlin's initial claims may seem (or however badly he goes about explaining it), he's always — <em>always</em> — proven to be right by the end of the episode.
<ul><li> Although this is finally subverted by <em>The Dark Tower</em>, when Merlin is trying to get the Knights to follow him. Arthur, being his usual ignorant self, starts to ignore him, but the Knights point out that it can't hurt as they're already lost, and ask Arthur to give him a chance.

</li><li> Commonly averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>.

</div></li><li> Another notable example is "Enigma", in which Gibbs' old CO enters stage left exemplifying this trope in full, with breathless panicked warnings about a massive black ops conspiracy going to the highest levels of the US government that's illegally manipulating wars, siphoning money out of Iraq, faked the death of Gibbs' old platoon leader to use him as one of their black operatives (before he defected to the colonel's side), and going to kill him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that the colonel <em>actually is</em> a paranoid schizophrenic, it was all in his head, the 'not really dead' guy is a hallucination only he can see, and the "massive conspiracy" was just a few guys embezzling some money that he stumbled across, and which his insane brain seized on and built up into a massive edifice of paranoia.</span>

Elsa confronts Anna in the dungeon and accuses her of treason, and then demands the guards leave her alone with her sister. Anna tells Elsa she would never even think of betraying her, pleading, "You have to believe me." Once she hears the guards close the door behind them, Elsa drops her angry mask and unlocks Anna's cell, assuring her, "Of course I believe you."

However, Mark, rather surprisingly, gives a calm and rational statement: "No Soph, look at me; honestly, she's in hospital. I can you give you her reference number.". This actually convinces Sophie, although it is unfortunately hinted that she may have already had her revenge.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>, an archaeologist discovers some artifacts that are potential weapons for the villains. Instead of visiting her as a Ranger and just explaining the situation, the Red Ranger shows up in civvies and tells her that people he can't talk about want the artifacts for reasons he also can't talk about, and can he have the artifacts for safekeeping? Not surprisingly, she says no.

Rather than realising what he's up to, Quatermass keeps interrupting to 'correct' the politician's supposed scientific error.

He's right, but unfortunately, instead of amassing evidence and going to his superiors, he proceeds to just start blowing Cardassian ships away left and right and then rants like a lunatic about how "they're all the same" and "I can smell their deceit" when Picard calls him out on it.

<ul><li> Joyce falls victim to this trope a bit, seeing as she has both naturally rather prone to anxiety and nervous tension and has been the victim of a campaign of discrediting/gaslighting by an abusive spouse even before her son went missing and gave her very good reason for hysterics, meaning that very few people are inclined to believe her when she insists that her missing son is somehow both alive despite all evidence <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including a body</span> and yet invisibly haunting the electrics of her home.

The two protagonists <em>always</em> jump straight to "We're from the future," never bothering to come up with some more plausible explanation for how they know what they do, no matter how many times it doesn't work.

Psychologist Tony Hill immediately demands that he be given the phone; he then adopts exactly the right inflection so that she not only listens to him, but believes him, gives the police her location, and agrees to lock herself into a bathroom stall until he will arrive, using his name as a pass word. This is an inversion in that it is the police convincing a citizen of a sinister plot and not vice versa, and an aversion in how professionally the task is handled. However, while Hill is a brilliant <em>theoretical</em> analyzer of criminals, he is also shown as very socially inept and in fact often more of a liability when interviewing friends and relatives of victims. For him to be <em>that</em> convincing is actually out of character, which might count as a hyper-aversion.

He usually doesn't rant and rave, but the fact that he talks about these things like they're perfectly reasonable and the person he's talking to is just a close-minded idiot doesn't help his credibility.
