The natural bane of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">The Corrupter</a>, and immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a>.
</p><p>While the people around them can be tempted by power, fame, sex, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">money</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">love</a>, this character is immune to succumbing to temptations. More <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundedCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundedCharacter">rounded characters</a> may feel the temptation and still resist. They will always do the right thing for the greater good, if not necessarily the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">nice thing</a>, at times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">even if violence is necessary</a>.
</p><p>They'll never lose their moral compass or idealism. Even having to engage in morally ambiguous acts, such as deceiving someone for a good cause, appears as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a> to them. They greet fame with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt">Think Nothing of It</a>, and often tell people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepTheReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepTheReward">Keep the Reward</a>; working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> causes, at most, mild annoyance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a> poses no difficulties to them. If they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">tortured</a>, they will endure. They will even — reluctantly — step aside and let others be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreHeroThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreHeroThanThou">More Hero Than Thou</a>, for good cause.

One argues for mercy - or that justice, in this case, will harm innocents; another may attempt to enforce justice, arguing that in the long run, knowing justice will be done to prevent harm to more innocents. While they are unlikely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander">slander</a> in any circumstance, some will let a lie or half-truth stand to prevent harm; others will tell the truth and damn the consequences.

They may also use their belief (if they hold one) in the fundamental goodness of humanity as a basis to offer second chances to people who would abuse it or reach out to help people who they should really be running away from.

Also very likely to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Hero</a>.
</p><p>This character is basically the polar opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a>, a purely <strong>evil</strong> character; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>, a character deliberately designed to be hated while Incorruptible Pure Pureness commonly invokes positive feelings in the audience. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">these characters are their most common enemies</a> for obvious reasons.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">Pure Is Not Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible">The Corruptible</a>.

My Goddess</a></em>: Belldandy defines the concept of a pure-hearted person. In the Season 1 Finale against the Lord of Terror, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Keiichi is infected by the Lord of Terror and possessed, she offers to take his place as the host. Seeing the opportunity to get rid of the human body he was using, the Lord of Terror separated himself from Keiichi to infect Belldandy, but couldn't. She is simply too pure. But because he had to move into something else, having detached himself, he moves into a nearby Floppy disk, leading to his defeat... at the hands of Skuld, armed with a small magnetic bar</span>. Her pureness also shows when, in the OVA, her angel is ripped out and replaced by a demon. Two minutes later, the demon radiates happiness and sparkles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill">Akame ga Kill!</a></em>: Tatsumi is the only member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroTeam">Night Raid</a> who respects others. He has faith that the team can save the Capital of the country from corruption, but unlike his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">teammates</a>, he has an optimistic hope for a brighter tomorrow and sees good within his fellow assassins, encouraging them to grow into kinder people. It's also one of the reasons why many female assassins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">develop an interest in him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>: Seiichiro Kitano is the scariest character to be incorruptibly pure.

In the Band of Hawk, where almost every member had some emotional baggage, Rickert's characterization, in contrast, came from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">innocence</a> despite being a mercenary. This comes to a head when Rickert meets Griffith, who offers him a chance to join him in his new kingdom, unaware that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Griffith sacrificed the whole Band of Hawk so he could achieve godhood and sadistically raped Casca his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> while Guts, his dearest friend and Casca's lover, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a> with his arm hacked off</span>. Despite stopping Guts from attacking Griffith, as soon Rickert learned the truth he was horrified and, when Griffith offered a second time, Rickert gave him a glorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourPiercingSlap">Armour-Piercing Slap</a> showing he is indeed incorruptible. Prior to the slap, Guts states correctly Rickert simply cannot hate Griffith like Guts does, as it's just not in Rickert's nature. While he did defy Griffith's wishes it was out of love and respect for the old Band of Hawk rather than revenge.
</li><li> Raki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> is like that.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Soichiro Yagami is a particularly heroic example; in spite of being surrounded by Death Gods and being manipulated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">his own son</a>, he's one of the only specs of white in a show that's otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Son Goku is the most famous example. Apart from being able <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyThePureOfHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyThePureOfHeart">to ride the Nimbus</a>, he also once survived an attack that worked by exploding one's heart with evil by the merit of not having a single shred of evil in him. His friends attributed this to him being really, really <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">dumb</a></em>. When he shook hands with Shin, the latter commented that his soul was indeed completely pure.
</li><li> Blue-haired Launch is this foremost female example of this, being the second person shown capable of riding the Nimbus. Unlike her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">bad blonde side</a> blue-haired Launch is selfless, affectionate and endearing even if her innocence makes her a little airheaded. The best example comes from Launchs appearance in the Buu saga where she freely gave her energy to Gokus spirit bomb not because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a> demanded she do it, Launch just liked Gokus nicer sounding voice when he pleaded for energy.
</li><li> Goku's sons Gohan and Goten are also this. Which is what allows them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingOnACloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingOnACloud">to ride the Nimbus cloud</a> before learning how to fly. Gohan, in particular, hated fighting and offered mercy to some of the evilest villains. Android 16 who has a similar mindset to Gohan consoled him saying peace was worth fighting for. This becomes poignant as Cell viciously destroys 16 in response and Gohan is driven over the edge and brutalizes Cell to a sadistic degree, Gohan never been this vindictive again and remains one of the most steadfast characters even purer than Goku at times. It helps Gohan lacks a lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies that plague Goku.
</li><li> Android 16 is one of the few characters who may just make Goku look bad by comparison, being a selfless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">nature loving</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>. Ironically 16 is by design a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> created to destroy Goku but harbours no real malice and doesnt hurt Goku in the slightest when he meets him, meaning 16 is incorruptible to his own programming. Though its 16 good nature that meant he was the only one who reaches Gohan emotionally and inspires him to kill Cell, 16 states (before getting his head crushed) that Gohan cannot love all life without also wanting to protect it from that which will destroy it.
</li><li> Future Trunks is another example which is amazing in itself since Trunks' parents are Bulma and Vegeta, two of the most selfish people in the whole series. Though considering Trunks was raised in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> where humanity's survival was the most important thing to him, becoming a polite selfless heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> was unavoidable. Present Trunks who had none of the aforementioned experience grew up to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> who's almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> by comparison.

And apparently purifying the spirit who possessed him, through soul contact alone, because Dark Yugi stopped coming up with creative Shadow Games and turned into a normal human being who happened to have a high school kid's body on timeshare. He has more overt flaws in the manga but is generally a pure-hearted, genuinely nice person.
</li><li> Ryo Bakura. After only knowing Yugi and the others for a day, he was willing to die to protect them from his dark side. In addition, his mom and beloved little sister died in a car accident, he was possessed by Yami Bakura, who would send any friends he made into comas by trapping them into RPG figures, he was bullied by the teachers for his creepy reputation, his dad was always gone and he more or less always was alone, and, by the time he met Yugi and his friends, he thought that there was something wrong inside of him.

He almost always does the morally upright thing, (for example he constantly saves his attackers from deadly situations, and in the event of a villain vs. villain fight he'll side with the losing party to prevent one from killing the other). He once defeated a villain that wanted to absorb and become him by the sheer force of his character - after defeating Spider-Man and having him at his mercy, the villain realized that he couldn't kill him and take his place since Spider-Man had never killed anyone, even in his decade long career as a crimefighter. He promptly gave up and left. One of the driving forces of the character is that he is so strongly compelled to do what he sees as the right thing that he can't give up being a super hero, even with all the misery and ruined relationships that it brings to his life.

<ul><li> Batman is sometimes depicted as being more incorruptible than Superman. The difference between them seems to be that Superman doesn't want to cross the line, where Batman <em>does</em> but simply can't bring himself to do it. Thus, Superman is good out of a desire to be good, while Batman is good because he is unable to be anything else, which makes him the incorruptible one.

A future Lex Luthor managed to corrupt most of the Teen Sidekicks and Legacy Heroes and came back in time to kill him because Jaime was one of the few heroes Lex couldn't corrupt, no matter what he did to the timeline. Also, Eclipso once tried to manifest Jaime's dark side by turning him into his darkest fantasies of power. Jaime turned into... a dentist.

Only the purest of heart are able to wield his hammer.

<ul><li> Sadly, Beta Ray Bill's hatred of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> (Bill's homeworld was consumed by Galactus) drives him to commit terrible deeds all in the name of destroying the planet eater.

</li><li> This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">depends on the writer</a>, however, and sometimes Superman and Wonder Woman are shown possessing these traits as well.

Billy's a troubled kid who cynically argues to the wizard that pure goodness doesn't exist, but the wizard sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">''enough'' good in him</a> to give him superpowers anyway.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> episode "Clash" revolves around Captain Marvel as a new member of the League.

He is naturally empathetic, due to his telepathic abilities. Considering how powerful he is, he shows a large amount of restraint. His real name J'onn J'onzz means "Light to The Light" in Martian.
</li><li> Likewise, one of the major themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> is invoking, subverting and playing with this trope. Matt Murdock created the Daredevil persona in order to rectify his Catholic faith with the fact that he saw evil to be fought against, distancing the actions from his "real" self. Every writer of the character since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a> likes to put Murdock through hell just to show that while someone pure of heart may bend when confronted with the evils of the world, <em>he won't break</em>.

<ul><li> Speaking of which, you know you're pure if the devil himself is obsessed with having your soul, treasuring it above all others. Mephisto was <em>introduced</em> in this otherwise mostly sci-fi comic, seeking to make the most pure soul in the universe fall. It's to the point where when it seems that the Surfer has finally snapped, given into his anger, and gone on a rampage, Mephisto, instead of saying "Hah! He's mine!" or "I knew nobody was <em>that</em> good!" he just rolls his eyes at the Surfer <em>thinking</em> he's gone dark, figuring he's going to scare some people, feel bad about it in short order, and undo the damage. Which is, of course, exactly what happens.

An unwavering supporter of the rights of the people and of the Jedi Order, Bail puts himself in danger multiple times during the rise of the Empire by either criticizing Palpatine's policies or aiding the Jedi. When Order 66 began, the safe thing to do was to stay as far away from the Jedi as possible. What Bail did was head straight for the spaceport and embark on a mission to the Coruscant temple to find any Jedi who had survived, and then to help them however he could. It was because of his incorruptible moral fiber that he became an enemy of the Empire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">it eventually led to all of Alderaan being destroyed</a>.

The two relatively tame sins that vex young Therese's conscience (picking a slightly larger piece of cake for herself, and continuing to read a novel when her sister had asked her to clean up) are about as scandalous as this movie gets.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em> does us a favor by introducing the characters in order of how pure and noble they are. The first character is a knight who is the epitome of perfection. He is spiritually perfect, and wears shabby clothes because he has transcended his desire for material possessions. Compare him to the next few pilgrims, such as his son who is perfect but for his lust, and a nun who is devout but loves fine clothes.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd">Parson</a> is probably the best example, out of the pilgrims. In the tales themselves, there's Custance in the Man of Law's Tale, St. Cecilia in the Second Nun's Tale, Griselda in the Clerk's Tale, the little singing boy in the Prioress' Tale, and Virginia in the Physician's Tale.

The honor of actually finding the Grail is reserved for Galahad, Percival, and Bors. (Even Bors was not perfect, but was allowed because of the perfection of his repentance.)
<ul><li> Galahad is an extreme example. The Siege Perilous was reserved by Merlin for the knight who would find the Grail. Since the Grail could only be found by the pure of heart, this essentially means that only people who were truly pure could sit upon it. As soon as he is knighted, he sits down upon the Siege Perilous, <em>before</em> the others can warn him. He doesn't die. Instead, his name is carved by magic onto the back of the seat.

However, when he defeats the genie and it offers him any wish with no skullduggery, all Eddie wants is evidence to prove that his client and his slutty wife were innocent, just like Roger asked.

Unlike his brother, he was upset about the possibility of Robb Stark dying despite them being enemies. Notably, he is on good terms with his entire family except for his aforementioned brother Joffrey, including his uncle Tyrion who is considered to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a> of their family. His only flaw in question is the simple fact that he can be manipulated easily, and this can be excused since he's still just a child. He also quickly realizes that a king needs to be wise.
</li><li> Carrot Ironfoundersson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, who has become less naive and more savvy but has retained all of his purity since coming to Ankh-Morpork.

<ul><li> A short list of things Vimes has resisted: The Gonne (which corrupted everyone else who held it except its creator and Carrot), The Summoning Dark (a quasi-demonic entity of pure revenge which managed some control before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being kicked out by the aforementioned construct</span>), and, several times, the urge to ignore the law, including one time when his boss was secretly standing behind him.
</li><li> Even criminals know him as incorruptible, and consider him to be so even if he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Vimes privately suspects himself of being a spoon.
</li></ul></li><li> Brutha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> as well. He's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a> of <em>Discworld</em>. He is also essentially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Jesus-equivalent</a> of his religion—except he manages to avoid the impending martyrdom, and hence the impending bloody crusades.

</li><li> Also Leonard da Quirm, who has been described as having "priceless, enquiring amber of Leonard's massive mind, underneath all that bright investigative genius was a kind of willful innocence that might in lesser men be called stupidity. It was the seat and soul of that force which, down the millennia, had caused mankind to stick its fingers in the electric light socket of the Universe and play with the switch to see what happened and then be very surprised when it did." He has also been shown to create designs of war machines in great detail but trust absolutely that no one would be evil enough to use them.

It is one of the hardest to find among human candidates, with only one hundred Earth Lensman graduating per year, though some other species have trouble even understanding the concept of corruptibility.

Unsurprisingly, novels set in this universe feature it quite often:

In one book, Major Rawne is urged to get himself out of Gaunt's regiment because Gaunt will get him killed, pointlessly, on a matter of honor, and that the Warmaster is amused by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsOldFashioned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsOldFashioned">old-fashioned honor</a>.
</li><li> While the reputation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, HERO OF THE IMPERIUM, that states he can thwart all attempts at diminishing his loyalty to the Imperium is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">an elaborate series of manipulations and half-truths</a> (and his aide Jurgen, a psychic "blank" that cancels all Warp abilities), his faith in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> is absolute, and his faith in self-preservation is even stronger. Not only is he incredibly resilient to the mental manipulations of Chaos for an untrained and un-augmented human (although often their sheer level of power overwhelms him), he is also immune to the brutal and ruthless mentalities so prevalent in the Imperium, and genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> (though he doesn't seem to realise it himself, claiming it to be part of the image he creates).
</li><li> This is the whole schtick of Grey Knights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Space Marine</a> chapter. Their self-titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreyKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreyKnights">novel</a> even has their commander (to bolster their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a>) specifically invoking the fact that for the whole millenia-long history of their chapter <em>not a single</em> Grey Knight has ever fallen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos</a>. Which is no small stuff, given that <em>all</em> Grey Knights are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psykers</a>, and as such are much more prone to corruption, but still no other chapter can put a similar achievement under its belt.
<ul><li> In the third book, Alaric <em>outwits a Daemon of Tzeentch</em> by destroying <em>every last facet of his mind and soul except the Grey Knight oath</em>, then picking the pieces up again.

In <em>False Gods</em>, when Loken is distressed by going up against rebels, their own people, rather than outsiders and worries about other rebellions, his friends intimidate they might report him for treason, and laugh at his reactions because he's so straight up and down.

One cannot be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure">Chosen as a Herald</a> without it, or at least the potential for it, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">Companions</a> make sure it stays intact.

The first King of Valdemar wanted a way to ensure that his descendents would always put the good of the kingdom ahead of their own interests, and wove a magic spell to this effect, then bound it up in a prayer to every god he'd ever heard of. The gods did him one better, providing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayRide">Companions</a> not only for the King and his heirs, but enough to establish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">a force of completely trustworthy agents and advisers</a>. The highest, most inviolate law in Valdemar is that the Monarch must be a Herald; any royal not worthy of being Chosen is passed over in the line of succession.

<ul><li> Michael Carpenter, along with his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paladin">Knights of the Cross</a>. Before agreeing to work with Harry, he insisted on a soulgaze (which is exactly what it sounds like; two people looking into each other's souls). Apparently Michael's soul was so beautiful it drove Harry to tears. Throughout the series, Michael maintains his faith in God and keeps being an honest, loving man despite all the horrors and evils he faces. However, as he is still a flawed man, there do exist things which would tempt him. The most prevalent is harming his children. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When a priest went rogue and tried to steal two holy swords Harry had in his possession, the man kidnapped Michael's daughter and put a bomb on her. So enraged, after beating the man with his old blade and a baseball bat, Michael was tempted to smite him in vengeance. He likely would have if Harry hadn't pleaded with him to not do it, or if it had to be done let Harry be the smiter. The words are enough for Michael to step back.</span>
</li><li> Harry himself seems like he would qualify. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He spends three to four years being tempted by the shadow of a fallen angel. During that time, she was slowly putting pressure on his temper to make it even more hair trigger. And while he did enjoy some of the perks the shadow gave him, like being able to speak dead languages, he never gave into the darker aspects of this. Eventually he converts the shadow angel to good, or at least good enough to sacrifice herself to save him. Though he hypothesizes that the actual angel would be as impossible to change as she claims, but as the shadow is imprinted in his mind, it's as malleable as that medium. For this action and his resistance, he was rewarded with Soulfire, Hellfire's opposite and called repeatedly "the fires of Creation."</span>
<ul><li> Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morgan, who unrelentingly harassed him when he feared Harry to be a warlock, comes to him for help. Lara even knows he is sheltering Morgan because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">people in trouble go to Harry, and Harry helps them</a>. Though the White Council is bent on executing Morgan even if he might be innocent — politics demands — Harry sticks through thick and thin trying to exonerate him.

And he points out to Mab that she's the LEAST EVIL of his choices. He's willing to take up Lasciel, or even use the Darkhallow, if that's what he has to do to get his daughter back. However, as told by Archangel Uriel, if he made his choice out of love, he will not wander so far from the path he couldn't make it back.</span>

He is essentially <em>purified</em> during his time in the monastery. He is still tempted, though, but resists the temptations with a will to sacrifice his own needs. His time as mayor on Montreuil seems to be a subversion, because he acts <em>righteous</em>, but still has his flaws.

In <em>A Just Determination</em>, he testifies on behalf of a captain whom he neither liked nor respected, did not think a good officer, and never wanted to serve under again, because while the man had done wrong, he was being hammered.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, several people are able to overcome the temptation of claiming the One Ring for themselves, or simply are not tempted at all. In the movies, the One Ring's powers of seduction are dialed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> to be almost active rather than passive and the characters' reactions are adjusted accordingly.
<ul><li> Faramir, despite what some might claim, <em>is</em> tempted by the Ring in the original. When he finds out Frodo has it, he smiles strangely, slowly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingOutLoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingOutLoud">thinks out loud</a> that the Ring is in his hands and the hobbits at his mercy, his eyes gleam, and he draws up to his full height. This alarms the hobbits who reach for their swords. However, Faramir rejects the Ring, because he understands the temptation and danger of the rings, partially thanks to tutelage from Gandalf.
</li><li> Gandalf and Galadriel are tempted at Bag End and Lothlorien, but they are able to resist because they, like Faramir, are Wise with a capital W. Galadriel also doesn't go radioactive.
</li><li> Aragorn never explicitly voices desire for the Ring either, though much like Faramir his eyes gleam and he stands up straight when he says he could get it for himself if he wanted to, alarming the hobbits. In light of the Faramir sequence above, he could also have resisted temptation at that moment. At the Council of Elrond he denies that the Ring is his by right when Frodo suggests it.
</li><li> At one point Sam has the Ring all to himself, and the Ring gives him visions of becoming a mighty lord, overthrowing Sauron and transforming Mordor from a wasteland to a gigantic garden. But Sam rejects this because he only wants to tend a garden on his own, not to lord it over others (and have them do the gardening), and when tempted to simply have a ginormous garden to himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">he simply shrugs it off</a> under the reasoning that he wouldn't be able to tend a garden that big.
</li><li> And Tom Bombadil is not tempted by the ring at all, and is probably the truest example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> in the book, but it's unclear as to exactly why or how that is. Maybe he was significantly older than the Ring. Or maybe he was in a whole other ballpark power-wise (he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">Inexplicably Awesome</a> - see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/TheLordOfTheRings">WMG for Lord of the Rings</a>).
</li><li> Frodo is given the task of delivering the Ring to Mount Doom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">specifically because of this trait,</a> but he actually turns out to be a deconstruction. Not only is the constant process of resisting the Ring's influence an enormous psychological and even physical burden on him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he eventually succumbs to its lure after lugging it all the way across Middle-earth to Mount Doom. No one, not even Frodo, is that pure. In Frodo's defense, he finally gave in to the temptations of the Ring only after bringing it to the single-most evil place in all of Middle-earth, which was so evil that even the Phial of Galadriel (which explicitly has the ability to shine where all other lights go out) stopped working</span>.
</li><li> Bilbo himself was tempted by the Ring for a short time when Frodo arrived at Rivendell, but like the others, the was able to shrug it off quickly, though he did ask that Frodo never show him the ring again. This is more significant than the other examples on this page, as Bilbo was in possession of the Ring for <em>sixty years</em> and was still able to resist it as readily as the others. Bilbo also remains the only person aside from Sam known to have possessed the Ring and willingly given it up.
</li><li> A dark example: Shelob is not even the slightest bit tempted by the ring, because it can offer nothing to someone that only wants to eat.

<ul><li> Jesus is offered dominion over all the Earth if He'll just bow down and worship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>. His response is predictable, given that it's Jesus.
</li><li> Other Biblical examples include Noah, Job, and Daniel.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>A.D Chronicles</em> series, being a Biblical historic fiction series about people affected by Jesus during his time on earth, has more than a few examples.
<ul><li> Jesus himself, obviously, although this series shows exactly how pure and how remarkable it is even better then the Bible at some points. The series is set during one of the most violent periods of Roman occupation; most of the Roman rulers (and quite a few of the Jewish ones) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monsters</a>, most of the religious leaders are corrupt, self-serving, or stubborn, and quite a few of the main point-of-view characters aren't exactly saints.
</li><li> The most pure human character in all the books is definitely Peniel, the blind beggar that Jesus healed on the Sabbath. He has been abused, horribly mistreated, and called a mistake ever since he was born, even by his own family. The only person who ever loved him, his older brother, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drowned when he was a child after jumping into the water to save him. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">mother</a> still blames him over ten years later and flat out says that he is a abomination who should have died instead.</span> The series continues to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> in various ways. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He loses his last gift from his brother, a bowl, when his tormentors smash it; his parents kick him out of their home and shun him, and even some fellow outcasts hate him.</span> Despite it all, he is one of the sweetest, most cheerful, and most hopeful people in the series. When he gets a good amount of money begging, he often shares it with his fellow beggars who are worse off (despite many of them being ungrateful) and,when given the first flower from a sacred bush, he gives it to a woman who recently lost two young children during riots. He also has an extremely strong faith; at one point, he humbly states that he has no right to be called knowledgeable about scripture, and honestly asserts that his only ambition is for the Messiah to come and relive him of his suffering. Despite not being a priest, who were believed the only ones capable of such a thing, he is often visited in his dreams by the spirits of important Jewish patriarchs; the visits started as a child, when he prayed to God for someone to talk to about scripture because he was lonely.
</li><li> Actually, the extent of Peniel's kind and innocent nature is a major point of confusion for other characters in the series, and also for characters from the follow-up <em>Jerusalem Chronicles</em> series. In Biblical times, being born blind or otherwise handicapped was a sign that either your parents had sinned, or that you were inherently completely sinful and irredeemable. Either way, it was believed that you were destined for hell and that your disability was God's punishment on you in this world. Despite being jerks and not very good people, Peniel's parents are fairly well-respected, so most people in the series generally believe that he's responsible for his own condition. However, his kind heart and cheerful nature confuse many of the other characters because it completely turns the popular belief on its head. His healing actually came about because a Jewish teacher told Jesus that he didn't understand; if disabled people were sinners, how could a blind beggar be such a good-natured and honest person? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jesus replied that Peniel wasn't a sinner; he was born so that Jesus could show His true power, and that Peniel himself would bring people to God with his faith. It is both indirectly implied and more or less stated in the books that he is the living embodiment of "Blessed be the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</span>

He does have some moments where he fails—big time. To be fair, it's not easy when magical forces that run the universe are trying to assert their dominance over you. As far as personal will goes, he never chooses to do anything malevolent or be dissuaded from his course of action.
</li><li> Number Ten Ox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds">Bridge of Birds</a></em>. Master Li says that he suffers from "an incurable case of purity of heart". It's also the reason for him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">subconsciously recognizing and worshiping Lotus Cloud as a goddess in disguise, whereas Master Li, the one with a "slight flaw in his character", did not for a long time</span>.
</li><li> The titular heroine of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> universe is this. Many characters in-universe have commented on her parents' apparent precognition at having named her Honor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyARetellingOfBeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyARetellingOfBeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty: A Retelling of Beauty and the Beast</a></em>, the Beast explains that his ancestors claimed to have this, and were so obnoxiously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> about it that a local wizard decided to curse them in order to teach them some humility. But it didn't stick, because they actually <em>were</em> every bit as pure and good as they claimed to be. So the wizard settled down and waited, figuring that sooner or later <em>someone</em> in the family was bound to step out of line enough for the curse to stick.
</li><li> This is interestingly the quality about women that Ambrosio lusts after in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonk">The Monk</a></em>. When it turns out that purity can indeed be corrupted, he turns petulant and spiteful. And violent.
</li><li> Cassie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> is presented this way: while all five of the other main characters experience significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> over the course of the fifty-four book series, Cassie stays the same from start to finish. Her particular brand of morality, while not always black and white, is portrayed as always <em>right</em>, and though she criticizes her teammates from start to finish and puts them at risk several times to justify her worldview, she is never faulted for it or called out on it. At one point she makes the call to sentence an enemy to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> and it's <em>Rachel</em> who takes the blame, even though Rachel was just doing Cassie's dirty work.
</li><li> Seemingly played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> with Dumbledore... until the final book. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore, the personification of everything that's Wise and Good, turns out to have been just as bad as Voldemort during his youth, as he was willing to enslave the Muggles with his friend Grindelwald. A fight on this matter with his brother resulted in the death of their sister, and was the defining event in his entire life, which led him to become the man we see in the books.</span>
<ul><li> On the other hand, Dumbledore considers Harry this, and repeatedly explains that this is his greatest power over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort</a>.
<ul><li> On the other other hand, Harry's successful use of the Cruciatus Curse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em> implies he's not so pure and incorruptible, as the spell requires real, cruel malice in one's heart to be able to perform it. Sure it was done against one of the more despicable Death Eaters, but given he previously failed to use it when an even more despicable one (Bellatrix), killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sirius</span>, it's clear that while Harry will never stoop anywhere near Voldemort's level, he's not <em>completely</em> incorruptible.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the central heroes, Hermione Granger is arguably the best example; unlike Harry, who wasn't above using an Unforgivable Curse and could be manipulated into rash, terrible decisions out of impulse, and Ron, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was for a time corrupted by the Horcrux locket, which led to him abandoning Harry and Hermione for weeks in their dangerous quest to destroy the Horcruxes</span>, Hermione is clever enough to find the most effective but least lethal way out of conflicts, resists all temptations to cruel acts or possession, is unquestionably the wisest of the three, and acts as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> to both boys.
</li><li> Minerva McGonagall may be a straighter example, as she is arguably the most morally upright character in the series - though she isn't above bending or breaking rules <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">when it's the right thing to do</a>.

A year's worth of indoctrination, rituals, and honors follow, but it only confuses him more. At the ceremony that "elevates" him to be permanently above and apart from other Kindar, he panics, telepathically shouts to everyone that he doesn't want to be "above" anyone and sends an "I love you" to his family.

<ul><li> Clark Kent, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and all. The related acts are too numerous to list, but here are a few: First of all, there's the fact that he's the most powerful being on Earth, and yet he never tries to take over or dominate the world or other people in any way. His main worries are: A. how to best help people, and B. how to protect his secret for the sake of his loved ones. Darkseid realizes that Clark is the single greatest threat to his power on Earth, as Clark is so good that he inspires the rest of Earth's population, and can potentially get them to rise up and reject the darkness being emanated from Apokolips <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Clark succeeds at this</span>. A desperate and frustrated Darkseid bellows in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> to Clark that "Eons have passed since I came face-to-face with a force that could possibly tip the balance to the light. You are the light! You cast out the darkness from Oliver Queen, and you will obliterate my darkness from the rest of the world if you are not stopped!"
</li><li> Jonathan and Martha Kent, naturally. <em>They are the canonical reason</em> why Clark himself becomes so incorruptible. Jonathan, as Clark's adoptive father, serves as a moral compass for Clark and serves as an example of what a man should be. He's not perfect, but he overcomes his very human flaws and serves as a guiding light in Clark's life. Martha is also a moral compass for Clark, and in "Beacon" Clark is in awe of her as she single-handedly rallies support for heroes all over the country. Lionel <em>tried</em> to tempt Martha to the dark side, but his attempts failed and Martha remained a hero. It really says something that while the rest of the world reveres Clark (or rather, The Blur) as their hero, Clark himself reveres his parents as <em>his</em> heroes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> for some is seen as this trope as well. During Season 6, she is mingling at a political gathering, and rather than play nice with a corrupt tycoon (like she was asked to do for the sake of not making a scene), she bluntly calls him out for his unscrupulous dealings. In another episode, Lois gets the ultimate power: she absorbs Clark's abilities. But rather than be corrupted by it like Lana was in another episode, Lois is eager to be a hero. She's so fiercely loyal to her loved ones and doing the right thing that even Darkseid failed to corrupt her, much to his frustration. She also never resents Clark for hiding his powers from her, and when she finds out about them, she actively tries to help him in his missions and notes that she completely understands his reasons for keeping them a secret. Lois even helps him brainstorm ways to preserve his identity going forward.
</li><li> Kara Zor-El, aka the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, is also seen by some as this trope sometimes. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darkseid</span> attempts to mind-control her early in Season 10, she—like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> in the same episode—has a heart pure enough to resist it.
</li><li> Even the "evil" versions of Clark (usually due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Green Rocks</a> of varying actual color) cause him, to, at worst, be a little more willing to entertain himself and slack off than normal, but still basically never at anyone else's expense. Sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">Poke the Poodle</a> personified, as red-k Clark and brainwashed Kal-el are still noticeably better people than average.
</li></ul></li><li> Kenneth the page in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> retains his sunny optimism despite being surrounded by unscrupulous business men and jaded industry types.
<ul><li> Probably the best example is the season 4 finale, in which he is unjustly fired. He crashes a party and announces that he's finally going to tell everyone present how he <em>really</em> feels about them and the way they have treated him over the years... he loved every minute of it and will see them all in heaven.
</li><li> In another episode, Jack, who is actively trying to corrupt Kenneth and test his virtue, traps him in an elevator with eight other people and informs him that since there is only enough oxygen for eight to survive long enough to be rescued, one person has to die (via the conveniently placed pistol in the phone box). Kenneth immediately grabs the pistol and tries to blow his own brains out, and when it turns out to be unloaded (duh), tries to strangle himself with his belt. This causes Jack to flee from the elevator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">completely unnerved</a> and spluttering, "What is <em>wrong</em> with you??"
</li><li> Though the episode does end with a subversion. After Jack gives Kenneth an expensive TV as an apology gift, Kenneth succumbs to the temptation of stealing cable.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Fred Rogers</a> might very well have been a real-life version of this trope. Let's face it, the man was just <em>GOOD.</em> Pure and simple. (But the man never did put his street shoes back on when he left for the day. Go ahead, check.)
</li><li> Fraser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em>. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysGetsHisMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysGetsHisMan">mountie</a>, gosh darn it!

Played straight with Arthur, however, and implied with Galahad.
</li><li> Alexis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion">Castle's</a> daughter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>. In one episode, Castle gets paranoid about his teenage daughter having done something illegal, like drugs. Alexis assures him that she's not and hasn't been in any kind of trouble. The next morning, Alexis wakes him up, tearful and guilt-ridden about having lied to him in their earlier heart-to-heart, and painfully forces herself to confess the truth... she jumped a subway turnstile without paying when she had a desperate need to catch the train. (The next day she swiped her card twice and didn't ride to make up for it.) He punishes her... with mandatory ice cream for breakfast. She has to punish <strong>herself</strong> with being grounded for a week. In another episode, she admits to her dad that she'd gone back to a store and secretly paid after some of her friends used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFingerDiscount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFingerDiscount">Five-Finger Discount</a>, despite the fact that <em>she hadn't stolen anything herself.</em>
</li><li> Captain Sheridan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, so much so that in the show's universe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he becomes a mythical figure himself, after Earth is bombed back to the middle ages.</span>
</li><li> Edith Bunker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em> is sweet and nice to everyone and completely honest, providing a contrast to her bigoted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> husband, Archie, whom she tolerates with endless patience. In the episode "Archie and Edith Alone", Archie even calls out her for it: "Good thing, that's you all over! Always doing good! Edith the Good! You never get mad at nobody, you never holler at nobody, you never swear, no, nothing! You're like a saint, Edith! You think it's fun living with a saint? It ain't!" He challenges her to "do something rotten"; she tries to insult him, then crash a bowl of flowers, but she can't do either.
</li><li> Rick from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> refuses to betray his ideals or leave a man - even a jerk like Merle - behind.
<ul><li> Subverted beginning mid-way through season 2, where Rick is a lot more willing to get his hands dirty and thrown out the window by the season's end, where Rick is effectively done being the nice guy.
</li><li> Glenn is the only member of Rick's group who has <em>never</em> killed a living person. This is despite the fact that he lives in a world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a>.

She never does anything objectionable and is always kind and follows her good morals. Also, Daniel Zapata and Carmen Carrillo never seem to get into trouble, are kind to everyone, and do well in school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger">Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger</a></em> has Hakuya Ryouga, whose character is defined by his inability to hate anyone, no matter what. A monster-of-the-week weapon that showed Yukito visions of his emotionally abusive father didn't affect Ryouga at all. His opposite number is Abarekiller, who terrorizes people because he thinks it's more exciting than being a good guy...but this just means Ryouga can prove his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> cred beyond doubt.
</li><li> Felix from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOddCouple">The Odd Couple</a></em>. He's one of the most innocent characters on the show, quite possibly <em>the</em> most innocent. He's shown to always want to do the right thing, and often serves as a moral compass to the others. Even when Oscar tries to get him to lie to help someone, he's extremely hesitant. He ends up doing it, but he feels so guilty about it that he cries, and later finds himself unable to stand the guilt, so he goes and tells the truth. There are several other instances where he outright refuses to do morally questionable things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamsonEnGert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamsonEnGert">Samson En Gert</a></em>: All the other cast members will lie, cheat and fight with each other, but Samson always remains the voice of reason and feels himself to be above all this quarreling and dishonesty.
</li><li> Willow Jenks from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> is so pure that, no matter what they tried, Miss Denby and Robert Frobisher-Smythe couldn't get her to sin and turn into a Sinner.
</li><li> Leo Fitz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> seems to be gearing up to this trope, having inherited the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a> from Coulson. Increasingly, Fitz shows himself to be willing to sacrifice his own life, his relationship with the person he loves, the trust of his friends - basically, anything that doesn't compromise another person's safety - in order to stick to his own moral code, which basically boils down to the idea that everyone is capable of good and therefore no one can acceptably be written off as collateral damage. Notably, he only ever wields a lethal weapon against an enemy mook when another person's life is in immediate danger; actively helps out his romantic rivals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">even when no he one would ever know it if he screwed them over</a>; and, perhaps most significantly, he is the first and most vocal supporter of the rights of Inhumans who isn't an Inhuman himself.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JusticeBao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JusticeBao">Justice Bao</a></em> was renowned in China for his stern and uncompromising morals. The series itself shows how often the corrupt and wicked would try to seduce, bribe, or undermine Bao Zheng, only to fail because he could not be bought or intimidated. In an era where bureaucratic corruption was rampant, Justice Bao earned a reputation for both unflinching honesty and his constant battles against corruption, to the point that he left a stern warning to <em>every future generation of his family</em> on his deathbed, explicitly blocking any corrupt family members from rejoining their kin in death:
<div class="indent"> "Any of my descendants who commits bribery as an official shall not be allowed back home nor buried in the family burial site. He who shares not my values is not my descendant."

This doesn't stop him from adhering to his morals and ideals and even passing them on other people (to some minor degree). It probably helps that he turns out to be a suprisingly capable manipulator with a knack for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>, so he can actually outmatch the jerks every so often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadMansGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadMansGun">Dead Man's Gun</a></em>: Leo Sunshine in "The Imposter" is notable for never abusing his power and being perfectly nice to the people around him after assuming the role of town marshal. He just wants to talk to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledDove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledDove">Soiled Dove</a> Angela instead of getting her to sleep with him. He takes good care of Marshal Hays horse. He shuts down his deputy's protection racket, saying that the salary the town pays them is what they agreed to and they shouldn't take more. He refuses to let a saloon owner run another peddler out of town (the way he used to) and buys something from the man while encouraging others to do so. When he hears that Angela is leaving town to open a dress shop he doesn't get jealous or upset, but is instead happy for her, despite thinking that he'll miss her. And at the end of the episode once he decides to leave he initial contemplates leaving his horse behind due to feeling the town will be able to feed it better than he will.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElSanto">El Santo</a> is usually remembered this way. In truth, the Santo gimmick was conceived as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rudo">rudo</a>, but fans were more intrigued by him than anything, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">EMLL</a> officially turned Santo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tecnico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tecnico">tecnico</a> to reflect reactions he got. Santo did have a bit of competitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a> that lead him to continuously challenge The Blue Demon, even after Blue Demon also became a tecnico specifically to avoid facing Santo in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliatingWager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliatingWager">a mask vs mask match</a> because he never got a win over Blue Demon that truly satisfied him, but was otherwise a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">Humble Hero</a> through and through. Santo's grandsons Axxel and Santo Jr seem to be similar in this regard, but his son, El Hijo del Santo, did become a rudo in CMLL. Even then Hijo del Santo was only bought as a rudo in CMLL and cheered at all of his independent appearances.
</li><li> Mil Mascaras, who was originally conceived as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> for Santo and is considered one of the big three of lucha libre second only to Santo and The Blue Demon, perhaps qualifies even more than his inspiration since there wasn't even an attempt to make him a rudo. This also applied to the rest of his family, until his brothers El Sicoledico and Dos Caras, as well as his nephews, proved to be effective rudos in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">the neighboring fifty states and Puerto Rico</a>, <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Dos Caras Jr</a>, although attempting to bring Dos Caras Jr's rudo routine back to Mexico fell flat every time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickySteamboat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RickySteamboat">Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat</a> wrestled in many countries and spent his entire career as a babyface, from his debut in the mid 1970s all the way through his retirement in 1994. Even in his recent appearances on WWE TV, he has never been the heel. Apparently, he wanted to turn heel but was told that even if he went out there and shaved off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">All-American Face</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s arms off with a chainsaw, the fans <em>still</em> wouldn't buy it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TitoSantana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TitoSantana">Tito Santana</a> is another wrestler with a long and distinguished career who never went heel.

This in fact worked against her, as she was practically unbeatable in the ring but would not stoop to the more underhanded tactics of her rivals, who often went to ridiculous extremes to keep Fiji from winning. Thus she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">never a champion of anything.</a>

He <em>has</em> been a heel a few times, but he came across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a> who didn't like what he was doing during all of them and fans still cheered him anyway.

The fans outright refused to go against him the few times he was heel, because he was such a nice guy. AJ never managed to become a <em>real</em> heel until he quit TNA and went to Japan to join the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> is commonly portrayed as this, and for the most part he really is. However, he's still a thug at heart, and will occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a> if you get him angry enough. His feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> hinged on the big monster attempting to get Cena to "embrace the hate", in order to corrupt him, as it were.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a>. Despite debuting alongside a heel in Mike Knox, being the focal point of WWECW's most hated group and getting quieter pops than some other baby face women, has never ever been a heel. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2y9ep');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2y9ep" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2y9ep');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">WWE was planning on turning Kelly heel in 2011. It would have had Kelly being revealed as the one behind bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens">Kharma</a> to WWE (which is why Kelly was never attacked by her) and would have led to Kelly having a long reign as Divas Champion with Kharma as her muscle. When Kharma got pregnant in real life, it was scrapped and Kelly remained a face.</span> She did manage to play with this somewhat, eventually adopting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a> persona in the ring, and <em>some</em> of her offence was a little heelish.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> is a notable example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.

</li><li> In an odd way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a> became this in WWE. On the independents, she had usually played an obnoxious arrogant heel. In WWE any attempts to make her heel didn't work and she has been held up as one of the most likable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">Faces</a> of the New Era. She finally turned heel at SummerSlam 2018, but like Sting (whom she's often compared to by fans), the turn comes across as half-hearted and most fans are on her side since she turned on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a>, who is considered by fans to be both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>, for hogging the spotlight away from other woman and coasting on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">father</a>'s name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Naomi">Naomi</a> is another woman who has rarely been a heel. She started as one in FCW and reverted a couple of times, but fans just loved her too much - and her natural likability and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround">impressive athleticism</a> made her a perfect face. WWE tried to turn her heel in 2015 but she came across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a> and eventually turned back face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that she knew the heel turn wouldn't work but went along with it for the sake of a title opportunity. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> portrayed her as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> among the other women.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> himself also qualifies, he never lies and he never tolerates injustice and sins, but he still forgives and loves those who faithfully follow his path. And it never changes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception states that Mary was free from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Original Sin</a> from the moment of her conception, so that she would be fit to be the Mother of Jesus. Mary embodies this trope especially in Catholicism and (to a lesser extent) in other churches.
</li><li> Out of many examples in Mormon literature, Alma the Younger stands out. He began as an outspoken enemy of Christianity, but after a miraculous conversion that parallels that of St. Paul, he becomes Christianity's greatest advocate. He eventually becomes so righteous that he is transformed into an angel and never dies.
</li><li> In Buddhism, beings that have achieved nirvana are said to be free from desires.

<ul><li> In the 1st through 3rd Editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, members of the Paladin class were required to maintain their Incorruptible Pure Pureness or lose their class abilities. Unfortunately, many problems arose when people played them as merciless, smite-happy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a> and GMs didn't call them on it, or when GMs interpreted even the slightest bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">grey morality</a> as an excuse to strip the paladin of their powers and players didn't call them on it. 4th Edition abolished this restriction, but they are expected to stay in line with the ideals of their patron god (so if your patron god expects you to be a bastion of Incorruptible Pure Pureness, then think twice about putting the orc kids to death. If your patron god is a slaughter-happy maniac, then think twice about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">petting those puppies</a> unless you intend to snap their necks while doing so)
<ul><li> 3.5 has a series of feats that grant absurd bonuses if they follow incredibly strict disciplines like taking a Vow of Peace (a feat requiring you to <em>never deal lethal injury to a living thing</em>, in exchange for <em>tremendous</em> numerical bonuses). The feat Vow of Poverty is the most extreme one, which grants the character a few bonuses in exchange for them never owning any material possessions save for the very basic essentials. Enforcing "fluff" rules (like non-mechanical penalties for starvation) is the only thing that limits them (other than the whole "can't lethally injure something" or "can't own shinies" things). In addition, a character must remain Exalted on top of the additional restrictions for the Vow itself (i.e. Exalted characters are to Good characters what regular Good characters are to Neutral ones).
</li><li> The end of 3.5 gave us <em>Heroes of Horror</em> and the near-definitive ruleset for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">taint</a> of evil, which treated evil that was vile enough as a physical thing that could corrupt the bodies and minds of characters. Characters with the Pure Soul feat were incorruptible, and immune to taint.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> has a class of characters called "Innocents" who share this trait. They get a certain amount of protection from the horrors of the Demiplane of Dread, but they lose it if they do evil or even get <em>exposed</em> to it in certain circumstances. The goal of the PCs is usually to keep that from happening. There's also a "True Innocent" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> that jacks this up to eleven. Paladins are brought back closer to this trope as well in said campaign setting: Paladins are such beacons of goodness that they <em>slightly dissolve the fabric of Ravenloft itself</em> enough to make the various Darklords able to sense their general location...
</li><li> This is the schtick of the Kender, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Hobbits</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting. Their entire racial fluff is about how they are eternal children, full of hope, innocence, wonder and optimism, and so they never fall into evil behavior or mannerisms.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed</a> by the Unconquered Sun in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. He's pure in four different ways that don't interact well, and deals with the stress by hanging out playing the Games of Divinity for, oh...about the last two thousand years.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> tends to subvert these kinds of characters whenever they can, the High Elf Everqueen seems relatively immune. Helps being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>, and she's so pure her very presence dissolves daemons and dark magics. The powers of the Everqueen come directly from the elven Mother Goddess Isha, so in a very real sense the Everqueen is the living avatar of a fragment of a divinity.
</li><li> Outside of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> literature mentioned above, there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">were</a> the Sensei, descendants of the Emperor who can't even have negative feelings like hate and envy, and the Star Child, the incorruptible innocence of the Emperor that he had to discard in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill his favourite son after purging him of all the evils that led to the fighting.</span>
<ul><li> The Grey Knights Chapter subjects its recruits to the equivalent of 666 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rapes</a> as part of their training, then erases their personalities at the end of it, <em>on top of</em> the nightmarish training regimes of a Space Marine, ensuring their complete incorruptibility. For the whole millenia-long history of their chapter <em>not a single</em> Grey Knight has ever fallen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos</a>, despite this being a setting where reading the wrong book or talking to the wrong person leaves one open to Chaos taint. Supposedly their purity and piety is so extreme that demons find it <em>physically painful</em> to even get near them (apart from the physical pain caused by the boltguns and flamethrowers, that is).
<ul><li> The 5th edition codex adds another layer of pureness, the Purifiers, who are considered even more incorruptible than their fellow brethren. And then there's their champion, Castellan Crowe, who's so pure that he carries around a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">daemon sword</a></em> with no ill effect.
</li></ul></li><li> The Exorcists chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> are an unusual take: Each member is subjected to possession (by as weak a Warp denizen as they can find, with as much security as possible) then exorcized, after which the Exorcist is immune to possession (apparently becoming invisible to daemons).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Sisters</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">of Battle</a> have had only a single Sister fall willingly after many thousands of years of constantly battling Chaos.
</li><li> Darnath Lysander, Captain of the Imperial Fists 1st Company, was lost in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a> for a millennium. When he finally got spat out again, he was captured by the Chapter's arch-enemies and tortured. He broke out of his prison, <em>unarmed</em>, and returned to his Chapter. The Chaplains and Apothecaries tested him for six months for any sign of taint. He passed, and was given command of his old company. He then proceeded to hand the asses of his captors to them on a silver platter.
</li><li> The thirteenth company of the Space Wolves have been fighting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">the Eye of Terror</a>, uncorrupted, for approximately <em>ten thousand years</em>. Though that has a lot to do with them being already corrupted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">in a different way.</a>
</li><li> Tau as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">Commander Farsight</a> aside, their unshakeable belief in the "Greater Good", their resistant neurology and limited contact with Chaos in the short time they've been a spacefaring species mean they cannot be corrupted by it's effects. This is used to underscore their naïveté in the setting, as such in one short story where they believed they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">slain</a> "Slaanesh", when they had really just mistaken the patron Chaos god of some cultists for the name of their leader. Were it not for their anti-Chaos physiology and Greater Good philosophy protecting them, the Tau would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight</a> character in the board game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talisman">Talisman</a></em> represents this trope by starting the game with the Good alignment, and this cannot be changed throughout the game by any spell or effect that would normally change the alignment of a character. In practice, this means that the Knight can never use objects or followers that Good-aligned characters are prohibited from, they always take damage when encountering the Graveyard board space, and they are not affected by any board space, creature, stranger, event, or place card that specifically benefits or hinders characters of neutral or evil alignment.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://imgur.com/qQ3j7MB">This tale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has its protagonist, a kind (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">if rather dim-witted</a>) ex-fisherman in a cruel world whose kindness was taken advantage of all the time, and yet he never minded. His heart was too good to really be tarnished by it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> the party lived in was about to get worse, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> had acquired a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal">Power Crystal</a> that gave godlike power, but multiplied "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">corruption points</a>" by 100. The party was supposed to have stopped him <em>before</em> he got the crystal, so they were pretty much screwed. After managing to beat the Big Bad through luck and good use of an evil-vanquishing special power, the fisherman acquired the crystal, and used it. The DM declared the fisherman the new Big Bad, however there was one problem: The fisherman had <em>no corruption points at all</em>, and 100 times 0 is still 0. As a result, the world got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood">God of Good</a> it desperately needed, and became a better place because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> features the god Kurgess, a once mortal man who gained great acclaim through his many feats of athleticism and might. This inspired jealousy, and his rivals set a deadly trap for him during a race. Kurgess sacrificed himself to save the other participants, and after his death was elevated to godhood by Cayden Cailean and Desna, making him the rare mortal to achieve divinity simply through acts of morality, rather than supernatural means. As a god, he preaches fair play to all.
<ul><li> Shelyn seems to be this as well. It seems par for the course for a god of love, art, and beauty, but her brother Dou-Bral was one too. After leaving to explore the far reaches of the cosmos, Dou-Bral returned twisted and evil as the sadistic god of pain and darkness Zon-Kuthon. He and Shelyn battled, and during the fight she realized that his glaive was whispering to him. Wresting it away from him did not undo his corruption, but he did cease his attack and has refused to harm his sister ever since. Shelyn kept the glaive, and has endured its maddening whispers for countless centuries, but remains as pure-hearted as ever.

<ul><li> Sarah Brown from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls">Guys and Dolls</a></em> is an example of this, and this trope is parodied by her mission band's inability to "save" any souls until Sky makes the other gamblers come to the testimonial.
</li><li> The protagonist Violaine in the play <em>L'Annonce faite à Marie</em> (<em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.archive.org/stream/tidingsbroughtto00clau/tidingsbroughtto00clau_djvu.txt">The Tidings Brought to Mary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>) by Paul Claudel. Violaine is moved by pity to kiss a leper, and gives him her engagement ring to help finance the church. This does not sit well with her fiancé Jacques — especially now that she has contracted leprosy herself. Jacques marries Violaine's sister instead, but when their child dies, the saintly Violaine, blind and forsaken in the lepers' colony, brings the kid back to life.

<ul><li> Desdemona from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em> is the embodiment of rational virtue, making it all the more tragically ironic when she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating">Mistaken for Cheating</a>.

However, whether this trope <em>actually</em> fits her or not is open to interpretation, and almost all adaptations end up subverting it.

<ul><li> Terra Branford. While she was mentally enslaved by the Empire and forced to do horrible things while being controlled, when she is freed she later becomes a pure-hearted protector. She ends up caring for a group of orphans in Mobliz whose parents were murdered by Kefka after the Apocalypse. Once she finds out who she is, she becomes a protector, who fights not to kill, but to protect and to ensure hope. Completely driven by love, she never has hatred in her heart.
</li><li> Celes Chere is described as having a spirit as pure as snow, but she plays more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> as she has done past evil actions under free will due to being a general for the Empire. It can be said that she does fall under this trope later in the game, as the Empire tries to bring her back to their side on the Floating Island, but she refuses.
</li></ul></li><li> Aeris/Aerith Gainsborough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> is probably the only person alive in the world who could get The Planet to condone a Holy, besides the fact that she's the only person alive with the means and knowledge of how to do so. Nevertheless it seems that this might have been common among the Cetra when there were a lot of them. (This doesn't stop her from being a bit of a smart-aleck, though.)
</li><li> Firion in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasyOperaOmnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasyOperaOmnia">Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia</a></em> appearance. He feels no embarrassment in openly admiring the more experienced warriors of the group, is part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> and eagerly offers to help the party, and immediately insists that they help every princess who comes through a Torsion because they remind him of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Hilda</a>. He also declares that he trusts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">everyone</a></em> in the party.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em> he is forcibly transformed into a wolf. Even in this bestial form, various characters note that it hasn't diminished his nobility one bit. Interestingly enough, those characters who <em>don't</em> freak out when they see Wolf Link are usually innocent characters themselves (Agitha the wide-eyed bug collector and the innocent simpleton lantern salesman at Faron, among others).
</li><li> Princess Zelda also qualifies.

</li><li> The whole point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em> is for the main protagonist to become this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has quite a few examples, due to being about the nature of the heart:

There is no darkness in their hearts whatsoever, which gives them strange powers and makes them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Cosmic Keystone</a> when assembled.
</li><li> In <em>Birth by Sleep</em>, several characters observe that Ventus's heart is similar to theirs - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because his corruptible impurity was removed and molded into Vanitas a few years earlier.</span>
</li><li> By <em>3D</em>, Riku has gone from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible">The Corruptible</a> to a strange example of this. He may not have a heart of pure light, but he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">in complete control of his darkness.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not even <strong>Master Xehanort</strong> can turn him into a vessel, he can dive into the very deepest and darkest abyss without anything happening to him, and he can freely use its power now without any detrimental effects to him.</span>
</li><li> Sora and Mickey are the "regular" version of this - though their hearts may not be pure light, they have pure and incorruptible spirits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though constant physical and mental battles against Darkness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">eventually eroded the former's enough</a> that in <em>3D</em> Master Xehanort chose <em>him</em> in place of Riku as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">13th vessel</a>, and nearly fell completely to Darkness if not for Ventus's heart interfering, but even that isn't able to keep him down for long, and he bounces back to his normal, happy-go-lucky self once Riku frees his heart</span>. Same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Aqua</a>, being the only keybearer of the BBS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> to achieve the rank of Keyblade Master. Her purity isn't quite as much a part of her character as it is with Ventus or Sora, but it was still sufficient to allow her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to survive for more than a decade in the Realm of Darkness without her armor or her normal keyblade. Not the case anymore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em>, since she has fallen to darkness.</span>

As it is implied that Tifa (and possibly Aerith as well) represents Cloud Strife's light to oppose Sephiroth, who represents Cloud's darkness, it could very well be the case that both Aerith and Tifa either have hearts of pure light, or have developed extremely strong resistance against darkness.

She's noted as being so selfless she starved herself in order to buy medicine for those who couldn't afford it. Upon encountering the vampire Valvatorez, she offered him her blood willingly rather than see him feed on someone else. When she was eventually accused of being an enemy spy and executed, she was reborn as an angel in Celestia (implied to be an <em>extremely</em> rare occurrence in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>).
</li><li> In a weird way, Valvatorez becomes this, thanks to Artina. He was a bloody tyrant, and so offended when Artina expressed no fear that he swore he would drink no blood until he showed her true terror. His failure to take this promise seriously led to her death (he was supposed to protect her, because he needed her alive to scare her). Remorseful, he keeps his promise and abstains from blood for <em>400 years</em>. In the process he lost all his power, and is now a lowly Prinny instructor. He is now completely determined to keep any promises he makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">at all costs</a>. He also cares for the Prinnies (who are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">butt monkeys</a> of the universe), and enacts a Netherworld-wide campaign of reform to protect them.

She's a demon "delinquent", so she always attends class, obeys a self-inflicted curfew, and does volunteer work. This is delinquency because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad">Bad is Good and Good is Bad</a> in the Netherworld, and it's initially implied that this is merely a way to show how badass she and her friends are. But Raspberyl Mode reveals that it's more than that; she and Mao have been rivals since childhood, and it's this rivalry that keeps him motivated. When he drops into a funk after the events of the game, she strives to be even <em>more</em> delinquent by charging into Celestia and demanding to know how she can have the "heart of an angel". When Flonne gets her to admit that the reason she works so hard to be good is because she cares about Mao that much, she reveals that Raspberyl already <em>has</em> the heart of an angel.

Reason? He has the Heroic Heart, which resembles a star, that got separated from his main body when Kirby was split into ten and almost wiped out of existence by Necrodeus.

S/He also has quite the effect on various mob bosses: one of them can go from ruthless to respectable leader of a space station, while another can be convinced to <em>turn to charity work instead</em>. However, to truly fit the trope, the player must refrain from using any Renegade Interrupt. That's right, even the blade-breaking one.

As explained in the fifth game, <em>The Final Cinderella,</em> "Cinderella" is not actually a name but a title conferred upon young women of exceptional goodness and purity of heart.

He's a paladin, predictably. He's willing to lose his life, family, power, and everything he's ever known to save someone who saved him. Even after another rather pure paladin "strips" his powers and cuts off his connection to the Light (basically God in Warcraft), Tirion is STILL able to use his powers. The Light knows how pure Tirion is and won't stop supporting him just because of human laws. He's also able to purify a sword that was corrupted for years by pure evil just by touching it, and he shatters the demonic sword Frostmourne with a single touch from that sword he purified. He also (barely) survives destroying something that is basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a>.

She's vaguely aware of the <em>existence</em> of evil but has difficulty conceiving of it in others (with the possible exception of Sister Marguerite, with whom an antagonistic relationship would be an improvement for poor Claire). Her chipper innocence almost gets her in serious trouble when Gabrielle takes her to a supernatural nightclub.

We've only seen her get even slightly angry five times, and all were rather extreme circumstances: the return of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-warping</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">chaos</a> who wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse">make existence a living hell for all her subjects</a>; her favorite student inadvertently brainwashing the whole town into a brawl simply so she could complete a school assignment; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twilight's failure - from Celestia's perspective - to apply her friendship lessons when the former drives Princess Cadance (really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter">an impostor</a>) to tears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass">by accusing her of being evil</a></span>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow">said shapeshifting imposter</a> having attempted the murder of her niece and favorite student, and currently menacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">the rest of Celestia's beloved subjects</a> with the threat of a kingdom-wide invasion</span>; and Twilight admitting she spent the greater part of an episode lying to Celestia's face about her lack of acting talent to preserve her feelings. All other times, Celestia has shown the patience and virtue of a saint, been presented as infallible in her wisdom, and demonstrated a great capacity for forgiveness whenever Twilight was concerned. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic S7 E10 "A Royal Problem"</a></em> shows that Luna at least is able to get under her skin. Celestia acts uncharacteristically petty and mean-spirited when she perceives Luna to be ungrateful and unappreciative of how easy she (thinks) Luna has it.
</li></ul></li><li> Shows up via one-shot character Johnny Lovely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em> episode appropriately named "The Ballad of Johnny Lovely." Forced to take cotillion by their well-meaning parents, the neighborhood children wind up meeting the titular teen as he attempts to explain to them the value of manners and politeness, even stating he finds it so easy because that's how he was raise. Surprisingly, for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a></em> show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the normal cast doesn't instantly like him</a> and proceed to mock and harass him. Undaunted, he takes it in stride and tries to teach them how the cotillion lessons can make them better people, even managing to slightly impress Penny Proud. Ultimately, tired of being shown up by the new guy, the boys frame Johnny for a prank that gets him expelled from the class. This too he takes in stride, opting to instead leave a copy of "The Lovely Guide to Being Lovely" in each of their mailboxes. Finally getting the point, Penny attempts to find the mystery boy and apologize for their behavior, only to discover the spot they met him in was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">at the corner of Johnny Avenue and Lovely Street.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a> isn't pure; several times it's shown he has a serious rage problem, lashing out at his surroundings when things get exceptionally bad. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">sword</a>, though, was forged by the gods out of pure righteousness and cannot harm the innocent when in the hands of evil. It's so aligned with good that it abandons Jack for fifty years when he gives in to his rage, and doesn't return until he's mastered his anger and regained his good side.
</li><li> Similarly, the titular weapon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GaltarAndTheGoldenLance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GaltarAndTheGoldenLance">Galtar and the Golden Lance</a></em> literally cannot be used for evil. The very last episode of the series showed Galtar developing a potential rage problem toward the villain, Tormak, that made the Lance act unusually, but since there was no second season we don't know how this might have progressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: The titular sponge is always positive and chipper toward anyone, even the naughtiest and the cheapest. He's so loveable to the point that Plankton's Jerktonium has no effect on him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, the main protagonist Steven is a happy-go-lucky boy who just wants to help and befriend everybody he meets. He even shows some concern for enemies. Though Steven has his own flaws and insecurities about himself. He is genuinely kind hearted, compassionate, and innocent.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> with his mother, Rose Quartz/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink Diamond</span>. She is certainly a very compassionate gem, and whenever she does something bad, it's never out of malice. However, she has also made some pretty callous decisions, and is representative of a fallen angel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Optimus Prime</a>. There's a reason no other leader of the Autobots has gone uncontested. The one time that someone tried to force him to commit evil, he overcame the brainwashing and saved the day as well as all of the Autobots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em>: Wander. As an eternal optimist who sees the good in everyone, Wander will stop at nothing to help even the cruelest of villains find their way onto the path of good. However, he unable to reform Lord Hater, and by a bigger expense, Lord Dominator.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em> gives us Zeta, who in essence becomes this after his moral epiphany during the pilot. Though he did immoral things before hand, once he obtains sentience he becomes a soft spoken, loving, gentle, compassionate person who is innocent to the ways of the world. He seems to have a self imposed moral code of never killing anyone and doing his best not to hurt anybody, and his sincerest wish is to live his life peacefully.
</li><li> Apparently a racial trait of the illiops in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTeddyRuxpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTeddyRuxpin">The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin</a></em>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization">MAVO</a> succeeded in acquiring all of the crystals and ushering in their much prophecized Age of Darkness, Teddy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Burl</a> were the only good aligned characters unaffected by the magic. In point of fact, illiops are such founts of goodness and purity, they constitute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> for the predominately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> denizens of the Land of Ying.
</li><li> A stated benefit of being a vessel for the Power of Grayskull in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</a></em> and its sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a>.</em> The Horde had to straight up brainwash Adora to keep her on their side and still had to hide their evil nature from her. It apparently extends to their animal companions as well, as Beastman's mind control powers had no effect on Cringer when he tried to use them.
<ul><li> In one of the Horde's plans to defeat She-Ra, they created a female golem that copied the heroine's powers. It backfired because the golem copied She-Ra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">a bit too well</a>, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopiedTheMoralsToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopiedTheMoralsToo">her pure heart</a>.
