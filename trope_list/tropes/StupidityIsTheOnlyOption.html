They need to be captured by the guards, inadvertently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinDeliveryService">allow the villain to get the MacGuffin</a>, be betrayed, walk into a trap, or free the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>. Setbacks and challenges are a core building block of narrative, so this is fine... sometimes. Video game stories, however, have the protagonist controlled by you the player. What happens when the plot needs you personally to fail? Why, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">force the error</a>, of course. Whether it's due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">Cutscene</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a>, the game simply cannot progress until the awaiting disaster is triggered.
</p><p>In more 'literary' game stories, this might be explained for the same reasons as in a book - the character makes a mistake for perfectly understandable reasons, and perhaps even the other characters realize this. This is fine; great characters make great mistakes. In other games, a player sees where a plot point is going - or perhaps a villain-cam scene outright shows the betrayal awaiting Our Heroes - but the <em>characters themselves</em> are clueless, so this is also acceptable. There's a third option, though: enforced stupidity. Too hard to figure out a way to trick the player, or at least the character, into the blindingly obvious trap? Just force 'em in. Stupidity is the only option.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</a></em>, the game begins with you meeting Impa, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">skin is inexplicably blue</a>, and having to get through a rock that only the Hero can push. Of course, it turns out that she's possessed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Veran</a>. What makes this even stupider is what happens if you do it in a linked game, as Impa appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">Oracle of Seasons</a></em> and yet seems to not remember you at this point in <em>Ages</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, when you board the Ghost Ship, you are asked by a creepy girl to help rescue her sisters. Even though all four girls are extremely suspicious (including doing their damnedest to get you captured by monsters), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">you have no choice in the matter</a> and need to save them, at which point they turn out to be the dungeon boss. At least killing them afterwards is pretty satisfying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures">Four Swords Adventures</a></em> starts with you being dumped in front of a sword in a pedestal Shadow Link jumps around. You're flat out <em>told</em> that pulling the sword out will release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>, but if you refuse you'll just be stuck there until you do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>: In the "Enduring Resolve" Legends map, after you beat on him a bit Ghirahim turns tail and flees, crying that he's outmatched against you. You're ordered to pursue him... right into the heart of the enemy stronghold. Even if you catch up to him before he can make it and attack him some more, when at low health he just stops taking damage and can't be defeated. You have to let him run to the enemy base and chase him there. No prizes for guessing what happens next.
</li></ul></li><li> Several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, Amaterasu has to make a blind leap to advance the plot (once is straight down the gullet of a massive Water Dragon). After a while, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">companion</a> Issun comments that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">leap before you think</a>" is pretty much their motto. Also, you find an artifact that is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s source of power and must not fall into evil hands. So what do you do? Turn it right over to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">secretly but obviously evil</a> NPC, of course.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>, you have to push a red button with a sign saying "<span class="red">Don't Push!</span>", which frees King Boo and fifty Boos throughout the mansion. You must catch five Boos before a Toad will let you into the first-floor washroom, which contains the key required to proceed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> has a classic one in Chapter 3. To explore the train station, you need to prop the door open to let in some light. Your first inclination is to use the wooden pallet that is conveniently about two feet from the door, and your second is to use one of the paint cans that is about ten feet from the door. Unfortunately, neither of these work. Instead, the game forces you to jam the door open with your melee weapon, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which of course leaves you wide open for the zombies that were waiting patiently inside for you to do so.</span>
<ul><li> Then there's the end of episode 4, where Lee goes chasing after Vernon under the mistaken assumption that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kidnapped Clem</span>. While not completely outside the realm of possibility, did Lee and company really forget about the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> creepy stranger who has been talking to Clem over her walkie-talkie, found abandoned on the ground only moments before</span>? Though in their defense, it wouldn't have mattered since they would have had no idea where to start looking.
</li><li> In season 2, Omid warns Clementine to keep an eye on all her stuff when she heads into a bathroom. Thus, when she knocks over a water bottle and has to go after it, a savvy player will likely try to pick up her gun first. Except you can't, resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">another survivor stealing it and killing Omid</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime">Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</a></em> has this setup for the finale: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Carmelita</a> is bound and gagged, in a darkened room aboard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad's</a> zeppelin with a <em>frigging spotlight shining on her</em>. The player knows it's a trap. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Bentley</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Murray</a> know it's a trap. <em>Sly himself</em> knows it's a trap. There's about a thousand ways he <em>could</em> go about it, but he just runs right in and promptly gets captured.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider (2013)</a></em> has no less than three separate occasions where the player is required to do serious damage to the structural integrity of a location in order to proceed (detonating mines in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">the Scavenger's Den</a>, tearing down the roof of the Mountain Monastery, and exploding natural gas veins in the Geothermal Caverns). Each time other people are killed and Lara barely escapes with her life. Every time another character is captured and Lara is hidden and in the perfect position to just shoot the villain with any of her various guns (most of which <em>aren't even optional</em>), a cutscene happens where Lara takes out her bow and is as loud and as incompetent as possible which leads to Lara herself getting captured and/or the other captive getting injured.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a></em> a skill Lara can gain is highlighting traps before she walks into them. If you have it, in one optional tomb it will highlight a pressure plate in the middle of a passage Lara has to go through. Although the plate is small, the passage is fairly wide, and Lara has previously demonstrated her ability to squeeze through tight spaces and be able to navigate very narrow ledges, branches, beams and rock formations, there is no way to use the plentiful space on either side of the plate to get by without triggering it.
</li><li> The Murder desk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em> drops a couple bits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> early on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first person of interest in the first Murder case is a temp bartender, and one of the first POI's in the third Murder case is a full-time bartender working in <em>another</em> bar, who casually mentions that one of their temps was working around the time of the murder and "would probably know more."</span> To prevent the player from instantly making the game about four or five missions shorter, you are given no option to follow up on this rather obvious clue.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> games require some stupid player actions in order to follow the plot of the books. E.g., in some versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">the first game</a>, you can't put your invisibility cloak back on after sending Norbert away, since getting caught is essential to the plot of the source material. And in the Xbox version, because the invisibility cloak had functionally no effect to begin with; you'd get caught by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> anyway. This is not exactly helpful when the point is <strong>not</strong> getting caught for once.

Gee, what could possibly go wrong? What you mean it's a trap? And yes, the only way to beat the boss is to put all of your god energy into it. (To be fair, it was either "Put all your godly energy into a sword" or get flattened by metal statue that was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>.)

At best you can use your prior knowledge to preemptively fall down the pit before the trap and put yourself in a safer position than if you just blindly ran into the trap.

After hearing that "something" is lurking in a mysterious forest and killing/eating locals and wildlife, you come across a hideous, decrepit, Gollum-like, hissing old creature constantly letting slip obvious comments about wanting to eat you, all the while claiming to be a "poor old ladyyyy... hiss... jussssst picking bones... I MEAN FLOWERS, yessss, flowers, for my sssssteeeeew...". You are then forced to walk home to her little cave/hovel in the dark/evil part of the forest where she locks you in. It's made all the worse by the fact that April seems perfectly aware that she's wandering into a trap via her meta-comments regarding the fairy-tale-esque world in which she's adventuring, but that the logic and decision making sections of her brain are not communicating too well...

You enter battle with the priest, with no evidence other than the word of the cultists, and the priest forgoes the superstrength of the Snatchers for a simple punch attack which does little damage. The game cannot continue until you shoot the priest, killing him instantly and losing your job as a result, forcing you to go undercover under the mantle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Solid Snake</a> (as insisted upon by your wife) in order to clear your name.

The two are obviously acting at cross-purposes to each other, so whatever is beneficial for one character will be detrimental to the other, and you are always required to do a bare minimum of beneficial actions for one character in order to advance the plot: at which point you switch to the other character, and so on and so on ad infinitum.
</li><li> The adventure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom">Loom</a></em> has a few examples, all of which should make you feel fortunate that this is the type of game where can't die:
<ul><li> At around the midpoint, you get snatched by a dragon and taken to her lair. She and her treasure hoard are blocking the only way out, and it soon becomes clear that she has no intention of letting you go. What to do? Simple: use a reverse Straw to Gold draft to turn her entire hoard into worthless rubbish. This unlocks the "A" note on your distaff, allowing you to cast a Sleep draft on her, whereupon she sets fire to the straw and flees in terror, allowing you to escape.
</li><li> In the Blacksmiths' Guild, you eventually come across Edgewise working on the last of 10,000 swords contracted by Bishop Mandible. The noise is awful and making your head hurt. How to deal with it? Why, simply cast Twisting (or reverse Sharpness) on the sword so Edgewise can't work on it anymore, not to mention tick off both Mandible and the leader of the guild, both of whom are in the same room that very moment.
</li><li> That, naturally, results in you getting captured by Bishop Mandible, who locks you up in a cage and then pretty much dares you escape. Of course, you can easily do this with the Opening draft, but you know that the bishop is expecting this and will be ready to respond. Except for there isn't anything else that you can do.

What you're supposed to do is use the access codes you learned post-assimilation to defeat the Borg, sufficiently impressing Q with your ability to "think outside the box". There are also a few subversions, puzzles that offer you several fatally stupid options, where the real solution is to do <em>nothing</em> and let the timer run out. Your character being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime">Heroic Mime</a>, the rest of the crew consider this a compelling argument.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostCrown">The Lost Crown</a></em>, you find the titular artifact and then are presented with the dilemma of finding a safe place to put it. What you're <em>supposed</em> to do is put it in the trunk in your bedroom, but after you do a guy breaks in, steals the crown and gets killed. However, to have gotten that far in the game, you need to have found the safe in the basement of your house and inspected the contents, meaning you know the safe's there and how to open it. Putting the crown in <em>there</em> only becomes an option after the guy gets killed.

The player actually has the option to search behind the target, but if they elect to do so, Hopkins insists that there is nothing there. The only way to proceed in the game is to kill the victim.

<ul><li> The "walking into a scripted trap" seems to be a common trope since the dawn of FPS games to force your character to start from scratch to keep the game from getting boring after you've gained all the cool weapons and ammo. The earliest iteration of this that comes to mind was the segue at the end of Episode 1 of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> where after killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">boss monsters</a>, there's nothing left to do but teleport to hell and die, thus starting Episode 2 with nothing but a pistol and your fists. <em>Doom</em> was also known to have situations where you <em>knew</em> it was a trap but had no choice. See that keycard you <em>need</em> to complete the level? Is it isolated in a well-lit alcove in an otherwise dark room? Then you can guarantee that the second you grab it, monsters will come flooding into the room. Even if you know it's a trap, you have <em>no option</em> other than to fight your way through it.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, you find yourself in the middle of a filthy, wrecked room with a barely functioning vending machine full of dirty syringes. You have to pick one up and jam it into your arm to continue the game, infection risks and common sense be damned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>: it turns out you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Controlled</a>. Several early actions that the player character takes make a lot more in-universe sense once this is revealed; the whole thing is, among other things, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> and commentary on the illusion of choice in video games.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, there's a mandatory plot sequence where Gordon is captured by HECU marines. The room where this happens has a conveniently placed health charger and is the only way to proceed. On subsequent playthroughs, no matter how hard you try, you cannot fight these enemies. You can lay down grenades, fire into the room until all your ammo is gone, whatever, but once you walk in there, they get you. The doorway is fairly innocuous and the subsequent capture does tend to come as a surprise; it's only really frustrating when you go back and try to find a way around it and figure out there isn't actually one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> gives the player no choice but to climb into a Stalker pod in the Combine Citadel. And after being (of course) captured, stripped of your weapons, and escaping due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, you are later required to step into another, identical, pod, <em>and be captured again</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who congratulates you for delivering yourself to him so conveniently.
</li><li> In many non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame">Stealth Based Games</a> that nonetheless possess a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth Based Missions</a>, the player will often sneak deep within the bowels of some heavily guarded location to accomplish some goal only to, upon reaching whatever you're after, be confronted with a shunt of absurd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">Insurmountable Waist Height Fences</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Musts</a> that force you to do some idiotic thing that you know will immediately blow your cover, raise the alarm and force you to fight your way back out in order to complete your mission. Prime examples would be <em>Red Faction</em>, <em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, and <em>Medal of Honor</em>.
<ul><li> The <em>MoH</em> series gets special mention here, seeing as how your character always sets 10-second timers on bombs that he plants during stealth missions (and sets off remote-detonated bombs barely out of blast range), making it impossible to get far enough from the explosion to avoid immediate implication.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> series falls victim to this, in which the only way to advance the level forward is for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">YOU</a>, most often a mere private, though sometimes as high as a Sergeant, to be the first one to break cover and move out, even if the enemy is close enough to start shooting at you as soon as you break cover—your allies will do nothing and not move to support you or take down those enemies unless you move first.
<ul><li> Similarly, Private Allen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em> is sent to infiltrate Makarov's terrorist organization to stop him from plotting attacks. Despite having a clear shot at the entire terrorist squad for the entire mission, Allen is forced to play along the entire time while they massacre civilians (read: perform exactly the sort of attack Allen was sent to stop). He has no option to attempt to subdue Makarov for capture. Naturally, at the end Makarov betrays you and pins the whole attack on the USA. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is later explained that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was Allen's commanding officer, but from Allen's and the player's perspective, it still comes off looking completely stupid.</span>
</li><li> A more unique example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty2">Call of Duty 2</a></em>: At one point in the Russian campaign, you are attempting to sneak through fuel pipelines to get past German soldiers and support allies at a heavily-defended station. The pre-mission journal entry even says that it's best to not let the Germans know you're in the pipe. So, naturally, as soon as you get to a hole in the pipe that would allow German soldiers to see you, one of your allies sent ahead <em>blocks the path forward until the Germans in question discover you</em>. Also naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">said ally gets himself shredded by machine gun fire before he can exit the pipe</a>, which shows you which path <em>not</em> to take.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the last campaign missions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em>, walking up the stairway to the train platform near the end of the mission results in you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">getting ambushed by a terrorist hiding around the corner</a>. However, the way that he is positioned makes it fully possible for you to see and shoot at him before you actually finish walking up the stairs, or to toss a grenade so that the blast manages to hit him. Unfortunately, the terrorist is protected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability">Story-Driven Invulnerability</a>, as taking him out before the ambush would break the entire chain of events leading up to you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> losing track of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics">Suitcase Nuke</a> before it detonates and takes out half of Paris</span>.
</li><li> For a hardened criminal with opulent experience doing time, Riddick does some surprisingly stupid things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromButcherBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromButcherBay">Escape from Butcher Bay</a></em>. Immediately upon his arrival to the slam, some fishy dude with a nervous voice and shifty eyes all of a sudden offers him a shiv (an illegal and relatively valuable item, mind you) completely for free. Although you can practically hear admiral Akbar shouting at that point, you have no choice but to go into the dude's cell and fall into an ambush. Later you must make him try to open a door with a retinal scanner, although him being an escaped inmate, it's clear from the start that it's not going to work but will instead trigger an alarm. Conveniently, the alarmed guards will open a necessary door for you.
</li><li> There's a level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> where you have to fall out of the (landed) spaceship to the ground, and spend a fair chunk of the level trying to find a way back in. It's designed so that the hole is difficult to see and easy to step on; most players are caught the first time around, because they're not expecting it. If you do see the hole and try to turn back, the game congratulates you for avoiding it, but then spawns ever-increasing aliens to attack you and drive you back, prompting you to jump through the hole to escape them.
</li><li> <em>Vivisector: Beast Inside</em> forces you to get into numerous obvious traps during the first third of the game, which is even more frustrating when said traps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">are designed to make you into a sitting duck for wave after wave of enemy mooks</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>'s "Dead Air" campaign features, at the last leg of the penultimate map, a metal detector. Because of all your weapons, walking through it sets it off and triggers a horde of infected. Naturally, everyone will want to skip around its sides, which is easily done. Even <em>the AI</em> understands this and goes around.

</li><li> In <em>Torgue's Campaign of Carnage</em> you have to fight Pyro Pete to gain access to a sponsor, whom he has locked up. Torgue, who's understanding of subtlety is on par with that of a rocket launcher, narrates Pete's entire plot of setting up the arena as a trap for you, <em>before you actually step in</em>. You still have to do it, considering you still need that sponsor and the whole thing is a televised show, but Pete is understandably less enthusiastic now that Torgue stole his thunder.

The very same gnoll chieftain who you actually have been told by that point by one of the very few characters that isn't a moron, is the leader of the moderate faction. a few zones later, you wind up needing to more or less defeat the entire species in a battle that would have been avoidable had you actually listened to what people were telling you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse">Phantasy Star Universe</a></em>, the second part of the Episode 3 story mission Ambition's End offers you the choice between taking one of four NPCs. Each one is effectively as useless as the others, but nevertheless each at least has some offensive potential, some variety of useful ability, and the potential to act as a passable meatshield when required. No matter which you pick, you are instead forced to take the most useless NPC in the game, a laughably weak liability named Lumia Waber who has pathetic weapons, inflicts pathetic damage, has absolutely no special abilities, dies if an enemy breathes on her too hard and who more often than not will choose to overwrite your level Awesome buffs with her level Useless ones.

When you get to the library, there's no way to get a book for yourself (or if there is one, it's far from obvious); however, the librarian has the question mark over his head that denotes that you're supposed to talk to him. And he says the book doesn't exist. Then you go back and talk to your teacher again:
<div class="indent"><strong>Drake:</strong> You <em>talked</em> to the librarian? Didn't I instruct you not to? ...(sigh) You disappoint me.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has a depressingly large amount of quests where your character has to be incredibly gullible, usually by being tricked into doing something that helps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the quest. Granted, <em>Runescape</em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">fourth wall problem</a>, and it has a rather silly sense of humour.
<ul><li> The Priest in Peril quest, where your character is trying to find the missing priest Drezel in the temple of Paterdomus. The temple, as it turns out, has been taken over by a band of Zamorak monks who have imprisoned Drezel. When your character finds the front door locked, you are given the option to knock. The dialogue from the Zamorak monks is so jokey that it's hard to believe that the protagonist doesn't at least suspect that there's something up and it's not really Drezel telling him/her to kill the temple's guard dog. But you've got no choice but to do it anyway, and then be subjected to King Roald berating you for your stupidity. Otherwise, you'll never finish the quest, and never have access to Morytania and all its related places, mini-games, and quests.
</li><li> Other examples aren't quite as bad. A player who hasn't read storyline spoilers might believe that a certain character in In Search of the Myreque is an ally of the Myreque <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and therefore be legitimately caught off guard when Venkstrom Krause is revealed as their enemy</span>. Still, one would think the protagonist would become a bit more skeptical about certain things certain shady characters ask him/her to do, especially if the shady characters in question don't give a really good reason for doing those things.
</li><li> Another big one is the Regicide quest. The player character is sent on a mission to assassinate King Lathas's evil brother, King Tyras. There are several hints that King Lathas is the real evil one, but there is no option to refuse. Even if you figure out what is going on, you must kill the good King Tyras to continue the storyline.
</li><li> The Legends' Quest is one of the few cases where stupidity isn't the only option, however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">the player might not realize this unless they are using a guide</a>. While exploring a dungeon, the player character encounters a ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">whose name is obviously an anagram of the name of the demon they recently fought</a>. The ghost asks the player to help them by killing an undead wizard using a dark dagger. The player can instead exit the dungeon and show the dark dagger to an NPC who will recognize what it is and give you an item that forces the ghost to reveal himself to be the demon. This path makes the quest take longer to complete and forces you to pay the cost to enter the dungeon a second time, but it makes the second and third battle with the demon much easier.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are many minor cases where the player is "tricked" into working to advance the bad guys' plots. Granted, the first time a player does this, it's probably a surprise, but given how the game encourages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis">Alt-itis</a>, you still have to do the exact same quests the second (and third, and fourth...) times through.
</li><li> Teron Gorefiend is perhaps the quintessential example of this in <em>Burning Crusade</em>. Appearing as a mysterious spirit, the player must acquire a variety of items associated with Teron Gorefiend on his behalf, returning him to his body.
</li><li> Drakuru in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> is a surprisingly friendly troll who for some reason is set on betraying and massacring his own people. Following his quest lines results in the player undermining the Drakkari army, allowing the Scourge to invade and begin turning their Empire.
</li><li> Horde players in Northrend will pick up a quest chain from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Royal Apothecary Society</span>, helping them to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> perfect the plague they're planning to unleash indiscriminately against all sides</span>.
</li><li> The "Dagger in the Dark" scenario opens with Garrosh showing an intense hatred of Vol'jin before sending him into an uncharted cavern with several of his loyalists. Sure enough they attempt to kill Vol'jin.
</li><li> In <em>Legion</em>, there's a quest chain in Stormheim in which the Tauren initially giving you quests suddenly disappear and are replaced by some extremely suspicious goblins. They constantly let slip their real intentions, are obviously just playing for time while they load up all the Taurens' stuff that they're stealing, send you to quests that they expect to kill you, and give rewards that are described as looking valuable (but are useless as items) and are later revealed to be absurdly worthless. But unless you first do the quest chain (and earn the in-game title "the Gullible"), the story doesn't give any option to question them or take them to justice. You can either leave them there or be "fooled" first so that you get a chance for revenge later.
</li><li> Xal'atath's quest line in <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> has shades of this. Players begin by finding a dagger which is suspected to contain an Old God and proceed to follow its every direction. This results in Xal'atath being freed, N'zoth awakened, and the player marked with a maddening third eye.
<ul><li> On the Horde side, Queen Talanji reprimands players for blindly following the dagger's directions which makes what happens next even <em>stupider</em>. After finding the dagger again there is a new presence inside which directs the player to take it to Sylvanas. And the player <em>does so</em>, thus exposing the Warchief and her council to potential corruption by an Old God.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the missions in the "Cloaked Intentions" series begins with the player's ship (investigating the disappearance of another vessel) warping into the system to find a mysterious satellite surrounded by several drifting derelict hulks. Naturally, the only way to proceed is to fly right up to it, scan it with your sensors, and get stuck in the flypaper yourself.
</li><li> Another mission ("Divide et Impera", mercifully removed entirely from the game in 2015) had you following the orders of an admiral of Starfleet Intelligence on covert ops mission. The admiral joins you for the mission and orders you to do more questionable acts in the pursuit of your objective, including killing innocents. Not once are you allowed to disobey orders or even question them. At the end, guess what? Your admiral was an evil shapeshifting alien spy using you for his own diabolical ends! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">You are given no choice</a> but to carry the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> for the entire mission until she beams up after a brief firefight and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">gets away scott free</a>.
</li><li> Yet another mission has you doing an EVA on the hull of a space station, clomping around with magnetic boots. One section involves going through a damaged area with electrical discharged and burning plasma fired which you can easily just take another path to completely avoid, but the mission will not let you use a security panel you need to access unless you go through the hazards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior">Tree of Savior</a></em> has a moment of this as a funny side event in the Crystal Mines. While you're there, you may come across a plate of potato dumplings at the miner's resting hall. Even though you're explicitly told they don't look like they should be eaten, your only options are: "Eat it," "Try eating it," and "Must try eating it." Suffice to say, be glad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItTastesLikeFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItTastesLikeFeet">it's your character who's eating them and not you</a>.

<ul><li> Played straight many times with most of the Epic quests. For the most part, you're just a silent accomplice who tags along to the NPCs in their utter idiocy, but one of the worst examples is when you actually do get a choice (spare the orc prisoner to use him for a hostage exchange or kill him because he's too dangerous to live), you are overruled if you say that he must die. To make it even worse, you're later (earlier) called out by Celeborn for making such a poor choice of allowing him to live! Sure enough, everything in the questline would have gone more smoothly if you had simply killed him when you first captured him.
</li><li> In the Broadacres plotline in Western Rohan, the story involves a minor lord who is secretly working with Saruman to kill off his regional rivals and usurp his liege lady's position. Unfortunately, Turbine went out of their way to telegraph his intentions so discovering that he's evil is certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">The Un-Twist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal">Captain Obvious Reveal</a>. Your character is already suspecting a traitor, he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">main minion</a> keep assigning you quests where you are ambushed and upon your return are surprised you survive, his wife points out his suspicious behavior, he suggests very odd strategies, is extremely callous towards his liege lady's children, and by the end of the plotline his minion isn't even really hiding his anger at your continued survival anymore. Despite that, it takes his wife to point out to you that <em>he's the bad guy</em>.

(These are not spoilered out because they're not going to actually surprise anyone old enough to read and it's not like knowing what's going to happen can change the result anyway.)
<ul><li> On one of your missions a character more or less invites himself along, even though it's obvious to pretty much anyone that he's going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> at best.
</li><li> Having done that, he then does something <em>painfully</em> stupid during a cutscene, while the player character more or less just sort of passively watches like, "eh, why not".
</li><li> <em>Exactly</em> how bad that was isn't <em>immediately</em> revealed, but that it was indeed bad is clear. What are you gonna do, though? You head off with him like "Oh, that went well, let's go home."
</li><li> The next advancement quest in the guild has him invite himself along AGAIN. And because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a>, sure, you'll go meet him out in the middle of nowhere. With his hired swordsman to "protect" you.
</li><li> Subverting things slightly, the swordsman does indeed help you rather than run you through. Until he leaves just before Obviously Evil Dude says "Why don't you go take a look in that dark cave."
</li><li> Which you <em>do</em>, and then <em>turn your back on him</em> in a cutscene.

<ul><li> A few times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>, there is a sequence in which Samus's escape route is blocked by rubble, forcing the player to find another escape route. The sole route available passes through a high security area for which you have no clearance. Several plot revelations later, you finally make it back to the main area to be informed that you will most likely be arrested for breaching a secure area.
</li><li> Also in <em>Metroid Fusion</em> is the data room (where you install new abilities) in Sector 2 (TRO). True, you're forced to take a rather long detour to get back to the Navigation Room thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">SA-X</a>, but there really is no reason you can't take that same route back to the room other than it taking a bit of time. You can actually go back whenever you want, but Adam instead acts as if it's become completely inaccessible and forces you to keep unlocking security doors to reach new rooms (and inadvertently allowing the X to infest more areas of the station).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>, while hunting down Gandrayda (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">rival bounty hunter</a> who has recently defected, and whom the introductory sequence has <em>explicitly established</em> as being a shapeshifter), Samus encounters a lone Federation Marine in the middle of the Space Pirates' home planet. He neither explains why he's there nor bothers to explain why, exactly, Samus should come with him, only that they "have to take the elevator to get out." His first transmission to the player, before one even sees him, has the player thinking "it's Gandrayda", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and they're absolutely right. However, the cutscenes make it clear that Samus wasn't fooled, and was using Gandrayda to advance further</span>.
</li><li> Also in <em>Corruption</em> is a stage that requires you to call in your spacecraft to airstrike a shield generator. Said generator is surrounded by several blatantly obvious anti-aircraft cannons... but the doors leading out of the area are locked, and the game won't allow you to proceed until you actually call in your ship and get the crap shot out of it. At another point, you waltz into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a secret Pirate lab</span> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Metroids trapped in forcefield cages</span>. When you find the local weapon upgrade, it's in a forcefield container. To get it, you have to disable all the forcefields, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">with predictable results</a>.

With no way out, the player could ultimately decide to commit suicide by running off of the top of the tower... at which point, a floor magically appears underneath you! Turns out the only way to beat level 12 is by simply walking off of the edge of the tower.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>: In order to get the PSI blast power, Sasha Nein claims Raz has to defeat 1000 censors in his mind then walks off.

Some platforming and a boss battle later, Sasha gives you the PSI blast power and tells Raz to never mention the incident again... however, if you go back to Sasha's mind afterwards, he will say he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching">actually wanted Raz to overload the machine</a>.

The VERY FIRST MISSION of the game involves using a tiny Soviet force to infiltrate a massive Allied base and rescue three scientists, then try to get them out of the base, presumably using some kind of stealth or strategy, and escape via boats. The ONLY option is to have the scientists run as fast as they can RIGHT THROUGH THE ALLIED BASE while under HEAVY ENEMY FIRE from artillery that, although sluggish in targeting, can kill ANYTHING YOU HAVE with one hit.

</li><li> Earlier in the game, you come across an urn resting on top of a coin block. There appears to be nowhere else to go, aside from a section above you that requires you to jump on the block to reach it. In short, there is nothing to do but jump on the block or hit it. Either way, the urn falls and breaks, and you are accused of breaking it and forced to pay back its value if you wish to proceed. The rest of the chapter consists largely of paid slave labor. This one was also Mimi's doing. Basically, this seems to be Mimi's gimmick. She sets very obvious traps that you have to set off to keep the game going. Such as the time in Sammer's Kingdom where the Sammer King suspiciously shows up about 1/3 of the way through the chapter to just <em>give</em> you the Pure Heart. Instead of just giving it to you, he tells you that it's in that totally unsuspicious treasure chest that was just left on the arena.

<ul><li> The next-to-last mission for the Fighters' Guild quest series has you infiltrating the Blackwood Company, the evil unscrupulous murderous puppy-kicking rival to the Fighters' Guild. Despite having been warned repeatedly that the Blackwood Company hires people out for any job, however illegal or unscrupulous, despite the fact that your sole mission in this company is to find any incriminating evidence against them, and despite the fact that you are handed a flask of what they <em>tell you</em> is a highly illegal berserker drug and ordered to drink it as part of your induction into the Blackwood Company. Needless to say, by the time you snap out of your drug-induced walking hallucination/berserker rage, you've helped massacre an entire village full of innocent people while under the delusion you were just fighting goblins. Well, hey, at least you got your evidence, right? Oh, wait. Your <em>next</em> mission is to now go back to the Blackwood Company hall (which you are now a deserter from, thus meaning you have to fight your way back in against <em>the entire Blackwood Company staff in residence</em>), go into the basement, and destroy their drug production lab. Granted, it's possible to leave the village during the attack without harming anyone, but you still have to go back in and shut them down.
</li><li> The sidequest "Where Spirits Have Lease". You're supposed to evict the spirit of an <em>Evil Undead Wizard</em> from a haunted house. When you find his tomb, he asks you to rejoin his hand to his body in order to give him rest. A player's first thought is, naturally, "Trap!" Naturally, you can't just toss his evil corpse into the river. You have to rejoin the hand, causing you to have to fight a very powerful lich in order to destroy the spirit. The spirit even lampshades your gullibility.
</li><li> In one of the Mages Guild quests, you have to meet with the Count of Skingrad, and a man tells you to meet him at the Cursed Mine at 2:00 AM. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> You get attacked by a group of necromancers led by that same man, and when the Count shows up to save you he insults you for being so stupid</span>. Though this one might catch you off guard if you have prior knowledge that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the count is a vampire</span>, making his request to meet you in the middle of the night somewhat understandable.
</li><li> At the end of the Dark Brotherhood questline it's revealed that you've been following the assassination quests of someone else and not your leader, through "deaddrop" notes. The stupid part? It's completely obvious that the sources for the letters have been switched after the first two. The first two letters contain a clinical mission objective (such as "Kill so-and-so") whereas the fake letters are in a handwritten font and have more personalised orders (such as "so-and-so is wanted dead because they did such-and-such). You have no choice but to follow the instructions of the obviously fake notes until the questline's conclusion, getting your leader and half the Dark Brotherhood's Elders killed in the process. Worse, when you "discover" (in-character) the betrayal by finding the impostor's diary (and his mother's decaying head), you then meet with the heads of the Brotherhood, who have killed your boss thinking he was the traitor. The diary you've read (and could very well be carrying on your person) explicitly states that he wasn't, and that one of the other leaders of the Brotherhood is. Nonetheless, there is absolutely no option to mention this to the heads of the Brotherhood, no way to show them evidence of your boss's innocence or the fact that the traitor was still among them. Instead you have to go with them to the Night Mother's shrine, <em>exactly as the diary said the traitor was planning on</em>, and allow the trap to happen. You can even take the decaying head out and show it to him. His dialog clearly shows that he is the only one affected by this, but you can neither tell the other members, nor do they notice his reaction.

You have to cross the causeway, which the Mudman naturally causes to disappear again with you on it. And, in the beginning of the game, you are warned not to open a certain door. If you open it, what comes out will destroy your entire village. But if you don't, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">nothing will ever happen</a>.
</li><li> Also, at a certain point in the game, you have to sneak through a castle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in which Meilin creates an illusion of your childhood friend trapped in a dungeon (who had NO way of getting there). Shortly after being rescued, Ark falls into exactly the same trap AGAIN.</span>
</li><li> At another point, you have to wake the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Beruga from his cryogenic sleep. If you don't, the plot stops advancing. If you do, Ark gets killed by Beruga's drones a minute later (but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">gets better</a> again afterward).

There are about a hundred things the hero could have done that would have been more intelligent than simply walking up to the bad guys with only half his party and bearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> they're after.
</li><li> A lampshaded moment from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em> here (<a class="urllink" href="http://lparchive.org/Ultima-VII-Part-2-Serpent-Isle/Update%2022/">linky<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> Few examples are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> than one particularly bad scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms1">Wild ARMs</a></em>: Princess Cecilia has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">pendant the bad guys very clearly want</a> called the Tear Drop. At one point, an evil army raids and burns her hometown <em>just</em> to try and get the Tear Drop. The King is fully aware of what they're after, and orders Cecilia (and the rest of your party) escorted to the most secure inner sanctum of the castle and watched by a team of armed guards so as to protect them and the Tear Drop from the invading hordes. Then, Cecilia has the brilliant idea that if all they want is the Tear Drop, then she can stop the slaughter and destruction of her people by giving it to them. Not only is this a blindingly obvious bad idea to absolutely anyone except, apparently, your party, and not only does the game force you to actually walk up to them and hand over the Tear Drop instead of seeing it in a cutscene, but the game goes as far as making you play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">stealth minigame</a> to sneak past the guards and escape the well-defended inner sanctum so that you can walk up to the enemy lines! <em>Amazingly enough,</em> it turns out later that letting them have the Tear Drop was actually a bad idea, and the way the King scolds you for this is incredibly annoying. Bad enough that it was directly addressed in the remake. The elaborate lead-up where you're required to sneak out and personally hand it over is cut, and it's made clear that the choices were either "Give them the Teardrop and save the kingdom, hopefully giving you a chance to recover it before they can use it for evil" and "Don't give it to them, the kingdom and the heroes die, they get the Teardrop anyway, and now there's no-one to stop them."
</li><li> Probably every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> has at least one stupid trap the player must fall into.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> has an elf king living in a decrepit castle in the middle of nowhere, who supposedly dropped his crown in a dungeon. Despite the party having - presumably - heard about how a random dark elf, Astos, stole Matoya's crystal ball, they go through the dungeon and give the elf the crown. Guess who the elf was. Making things worse, the dungeon you have to go through to get the crown is (in the original game) a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a> over everything that came before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> has a point in the story where you return to your base and are told by just about every single person in the base that the queen has been acting very strangely, some speculating that she might have lost her mind after the death of the king. She then invites the lead protagonist to her bedroom specifically excluding the rest of his party. Considering that at worst, this is some kind of trap by the villains influencing the queen in some manner, and at BEST trying to sleep with a clearly very emotionally unstable person, you are still given no option but to follow her into the bedroom hop into bed and make no effort to resist at all. The truth is that the queen was replaced with a monster and the ONLY thing that saved the hero from getting stabbed in the back was that one of your party members was spying on you for fun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a point where the villains demands the last of the four crystals in exchange for the life of the protagonist's love interest. Instead of refusing or at the very least switching the real crystal out for a fake one like any other smart person would, our brainless heroes decide that the only option is to trade the world away for the life of one person. Even in this regard they nearly fail, as they hand over the crystal before they get their hostage back or even see that she's safe. In order to get her, they have to fight their way through a large dungeon and still barely manage to save her in time before she's executed.
</li><li> Twice in the face of decisive battles, the party decides, "Let's make the women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a>!" Yes, they're the game's best spellcasters and the only reason they have made it this far. The men decide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">big boss battles are exactly where not to bring the heal spells and earth-shattering summons</a>. Even worse, the first time they do this they get their asses handed to them and still get one of the girls abducted, but learn absolutely nothing from it. Admittedly, the first party split is suggested by the King of Fabul, and he has a good reason (both women have healing magic and the infirmary will need help.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, right after arriving in the second world, there is a scene where a monster kidnaps Lenna and Faris, and Bartz must fight it one-on-one so that he can be dragged off to the villain's hideout. Should he lose, he goes straight there, but if he wins, you'll be taken back to the area you were in, with a treasure chest that wasn't there before. It's quite obviously a trap (one containing sleeping gas, to be specific), but since Bartz can't leave the area and there's no other way to advance the story...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has the part where the emperor pretends to be regretful for what he's done and to lock Kefka away, while commanding you to go make peace with the Espers. There is no reason for your characters to believe this guy who's been a villain the whole game, but every attempt to assign blame or reject him has a "But Thou Must" that sets you up for the sudden but inevitable betrayal. To add insult to injury, the entire *nation* is in on the conspiracy, despite being decimated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, for example, sports a scene where the perverted mob boss you just ruthlessly interrogated actually points out that the only reason he would give everything away so easily is because he was sure he would win. And then you get trapped. For added stupidity, the party was on their way to Sector 7 anyway, and it would be much easier to take the land route (and possible open the gate between Sectors 6 and 7, which is how Tifa got into Sector 6 in the first place) than to fall for that trap. All it took to get there was to just keep on walking and leave the lech to his own fate. Stupid, stupid Cloud.

After rescuing Teim, you go to confront Duram, but instead of simply showing him his daughter is safe so he will no longer have a reason to rob anyone or block the path, Tiem suddenly walks up to him in disguise and refuses to comply with his robbery demands. Duram ends up killing Teim, and then blows himself up when he realizes he murdered his daughter. The final result is the tunnel is no longer blocked, but also two needless deaths that could have been easily avoided with a few sentences of dialog.

<ul><li> The game features the four challenges of the Jungle Relic. The player goes in to test their skills but is repeatedly told not to complete the fourth challenge as doing so would cause some disaster to befall the region. After completing the three available challenges, which all involve capturing a tough Pokémon, your companion suggests that you look at - but not do - the last one. Once there, the villains <em>announce their presence and tell you to capture a Charizard they found there</em>. The one up-side is that you try to leave, your companion will tell you to go back and help the Charizard so you can at least blame them when things go to hell.

Given that you've been told before this that sleeping Pokémon are ridiculously easy to catch you'd think you'd be given the option to just chuck a pokeball at it and wake it up that way. Nope, you have to use a pokemon flute to wake it up first so you can THEN battle it! One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwkwardZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwkwardZombie">Awkward Zombie</a></em> comic lampshades this stupidity.

<ul><li> You venture into a Vault in search of your missing father. The vault's run by some friendly enough robots who assume you're simply a late arrival, and has a sophisticated set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">sleeper pods</a> at its centre, whose occupants are clearly in there for the duration.

</li><li> In the original ending of the game, you are forced to choose to either sacrifice yourself or Sarah Lyons by entering the irradiated water purifier. If you happen to bring along a companion who is immune to radiation, you can attempt to send them in instead, but they will refuse to do it for basically no reason. Including Charon, who is brainwashed to obey the commands of whoever holds his contract (you) and thus should be <em>physically incapable</em> of telling you to go fuck yourself. This was fixed in the Broken Steel DLC, which lets you send an appropriate companion in and gives them dialog along the lines of "Oh yeah, that <em>would</em> make more sense, wouldn't it?". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonPerlman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonPerlman">Ron Perlman</a> still calls you a coward for not doing it yourself, though.

The class on field-trip made all the wrong choices to make when dealing with ancient ruins. Sometimes the player is asked "should we keep going" but gets shot down if the answer is the obvious "no". They making things really easy for the bad guys. Later, during the Altin Mines arc, you find yourself at a dead end, with a huge boulder at the end of a corridor with a sign next to it saying not to touch it. While you're supposed to use the Force Orb to knock it down then channel the spirit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> to outrun it, allowing it to blast a hold in the floor that leads to the boss' room, it's possible to skip getting the orb and get a different cutscene where Garet <em>kicks</em> the boulder. And if that wasn't enough, the entire plot got started because <em>a giant boulder killed the main character's parents</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge">Geneforge</a> 5</em> the player is given the mission to track down the origins of an assassination attempt of a ranking member of the government, with explicit orders not to let that attempt be revealed to anyone. The clues lead to a fortification commanded by a general with the arrogant discrimination and control-freak methods typical of the culture, but the game cannot progress unless the players reveal their purpose for being there to the guy in charge. In spite of being the hardass overseer type he knows nothing about what's going on in his fort in this case, but suggests that he couldn't possibly know anything that might be going on in a deathtrap that has been barred to everyone, leaving him as the only one with the authority to enter.

When you use the skull, you are transported to another world where you immediately run across a spirit trapped in a giant skull-shaped statue. It declares that it was once a famous knight, trapped in the skull by an evil necromancer. To the surprise of absolutely nobody, it's really the necromancer. Predictably, there is no other option than to free him. Once you do so, he mocks you for being gullible and tries to kill you.

<ul><li> There's also the hotel in which you stay on your first night in Innsmouth. The developers must have been worried that some players wouldn't pick up the atmosphere of "subtle" menace that suffuses the place, its proprietor, and every line of dialogue he speaks, so they helpfully included an easily accessible (almost impossible to miss, really) <em>room full of hacked-up human bodyparts</em>, complete with a bloodstained journal recounting the hotel owner's murders.

</li><li> In the 2004 flash horror game <em>Exmortis</em>, the protagonist reads <em>two separate journal accounts</em> of people who read the English translation of the Exmortis and were subsequently plagued by unspeakable horrors, their lives taken and ruined by supernatural forces. So naturally when you finally come across the book, the only option to move the game forward is to read it yourself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> seems to be very fond of forcing people to make stupid choices, especially when confronted with the eponymous Tome... one instance, in particular, with a franciscan monk, seemed quite out of character: "Should Paul Luther claim the Tome of Eternal Darkness?" For a catholic priest during the inquisition, one would think it would be more appropriate to "Burn the Tome of Eternal Darkness, its pedestal and the whole room with its screaming walls and moaning floors". Alas, the choice is between leaving with your new book made out of human flesh, or not leaving at all...
<ul><li> Again, in the same chapter: "Shall you put an end to this heresy?"

</li><li> And again: you have to pull the rope of the church bell to call the Custodian (which fortunately is still on your side), but that doesn't seems quite a good idea when the rest of his order is also hunting you for killing purposes...
</li><li> Human Pious Augustus: first, he hears suspect voices calling to him, to which he can only respond by getting to a strange stone circle to be teleported to his doom. Then the voices ask him to smash a statue of himself (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">quite metaphorical</a>) to open a door to his doom. And then he's confronted with three artifacts of unimaginable power (and, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">doom</a>). One would assume that after the first time you've died and been through hell and insanity for over two millenia, you would have learned to be more considerate before touching them again... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> instead you've got to do it two more times for the true plot to unfold!</span>
</li><li> For all intent and purposes, the endgame section is one giant stupid choice forced upon Alex and enacted with extreme determination: first <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you got to descend into the labyrinthine city of madness that dwells under Roivas Manor, after reading of a character that barely survived the ordeal (it didn't last)</span>; then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you'll learn that the only way to stop an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">eldritch abomination</a> from being unleashed upon the world is to summon an EVEN WORSE eldritch abomination, which, by the time you are done with the final boss, you'll have absolutely no way to send back (this is reversed, courtesy of Alex's dead grandpa, though it still counts as Alex had no way to know it at the time)</span>.

Thinking he's going to report a corruption story, Miles goes to the asylum and finds military vehicles parked outside and the door locked. Not taking this as a cue, Miles breaks into the asylum and finds barricades, blood on the walls, and no people, and keeps going anyway. It takes a guy impaled on a spike telling Miles to go for him to consider leaving, but by then he's been locked inside.

If the player goes after her, he comes upon a train car spattered with an obscene amount of blood and a large, mysterious figure shuffling away. The only option that progresses the story is to follow after this deranged, monstrous murderer with no weapon and no plan for survival. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Then again</a>, there's nothing stopping the player from doing what any sane person would do, conclude that Josh's wife (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">kind of a bitch anyway</a>) is almost certainly dead and run as far away from this madness as possible. The monsters do not pursue the player, so the player can turn off the game right then, satisfied that Josh wisely hid until the train reached its destination, reported the incident to the proper authorities, and then went about his newly-single life.
