Their family name is loaded with history.
</p><p>Unhappily, that family name is pretty much the only thing they have left. The great estates have long since been lost or sold off, the servants have left (except, sometimes, for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldRetainer">Old Retainer</a>), and the mortgage is due on the family castle. Whether by war, revolution or simple bad luck the noble dynasty is left penniless. This is made even worse since there are usually things their noble blood <em>obliges</em> them to spend money on, such as clothing befitting their roles or the upkeep on a needlessly large house that the family cannot sell without shame. Even worse, though some take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob">Fallen-on-Hard-Times Job</a>, others feel that doing a hard day's work is below them, or actually are legally forbidden to take up an occupation, or any one at which they could make real money — or are <em>incapable</em> of making their own money. They feel obligated (or may even be legally obligated by their title) to preserve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a>, although the author often disagrees with them about how good they really are.

</li><li> Lord St. Simon in "The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor" plans to marry an American woman because her father struck it rich in the California gold rush.
</li><li> In "The Three Students", one of the students is the son of an aristocrat who spent the family fortune on horses and alcohol.
</li><li> Holmes himself is hinted to be a milder version of this. His family were "country squires" — not a terribly wealthy brand of nobility to begin with. His older brother Mycroft lives much more comfortably (though given that Mycroft's entire life centers around his desk job, his flat, and his club, he likely doesn't have much in the way of expenses).

Lily's family, though they're farmers, are steadily moving up the monetary ladder, while Snow Flower is finely educated and has every refinement you could ask for, but can barely afford new clothes.

<ul><li> Count Vorfolse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACivilCampaign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACivilCampaign">A Civil Campaign</a></em> has the misfortune of having had his predecessors for the last several generations consistently choosing the losing side in every Barrayaran rebellion or civil war. So now, despite being the effective Head of State for a small country, he lives in a small apartment with a single, aging Armsman.
</li><li> Ghem-Lord Yenaro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cetaganda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cetaganda">Cetaganda</a></em> is in similar straits, being descended from the general who was responsible for the ultimate failure of the Cetagandan invasion of Barrayar. He allowed himself to be used as a pawn by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the hopes of getting a minor court position, and from there hopefully repair his family's fortunes. Miles rather sadly notes in his internal monologue that Yenaro didn't need any help to restore his family's <em>financial</em> fortunes, as he had genuine creative talents that he could easily have spun into a lucrative career if he'd put his mind to it, but he was so fixated on restoring the <em>status</em> of the family name that the idea seems not to have even occurred to him.
</li><li> This is actually fairly common for a number of the ghem, especially those who are lower-ranked or younger. Due to Cetaganda being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">hierarchical society</a> and a gerontocracy, most of the actual wealth is in the hands of the haut or upper-ranking ghem.
</li><li> While not technically true in the absolute sense, most Barrayaran nobles consider the Vorkosigan family to be poor, as many other districts were far wealthier. This is due to a number of justifiable factors. First, the Vorkosigan district suffered the most intense fighting during the war against Cetaganda, causing the better part of a generation's efforts to be spent in repairing the damage (some areas are still dangerously radioactive three generations later). Second, the Vorkosigans had, for at least three generations, spent most of their time serving the empire as a whole, rather than their own district in particular, which is patriotic but not conducive to bringing in wealth. At the end of his regency, Aral even makes a point of giving away enough money to reduce his family's personal net worth to exactly what it was at the <em>beginning</em> of his regency. Third, Mark was literally the first member of the family in five generations to go into business and turn a profit.

</li><li> This is common enough on Barrayar that Kareen Koudelka noted an established social protocol when visiting. If a 'Prole' host is shorthanded when preparing things the guests are encouraged to lend a hand, whereas the 'Vor rules' are to sit patiently and pretend one does not notice the lack of servants.

The girls are withdrawn from school, the household take in several lodgers, the two older girls start working for wages, and only after years of this does Sylvia think of moving out of a large house in a highly select district of London, getting a job and laying off two of her 3 servants (the remaining one is her own nanny, who has become surrogate grandmother to the Fossils and hasn't actually taken any cash pay for years). It's not entirely ignored that this isn't real poverty, especially when the novel was set (late 20s-30s). The brilliant, unpretty, unlucky Winifred's family are actually poor by normal standards. Also the house originally belonged to Sylvia's Uncle, she was essentially acting as a caretaker. It was only after she discovered that title had been put in her name that she could have sold it.

Only later does he come to appreciate her father's wealth, after his own father reveals the family is broke. He refers to his wife (who is from Scotland) as a "Scotch pension."

<ul><li> In the backstory, Robert's father, the 6th Earl of Grantham, was running low on cash but still had to maintain the eponymous ancestral estate (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>), which is why he arranged for Robert's marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Cora Levinson</a>, the daughter of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Jewish dry-goods magnate from Ohio</a> (can't get more American than that).

</li><li> In the third series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out that Robert idiotically invested the whole fortune in the Grand Trunk Railway, which crashed and was nationalised by the Canadian government — leaving the family's assets at almost nothing. The family gets ready to sell Downton Abbey and move to a smaller place (which was still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">gracious home</a>), but Robert's son-in-law/third cousin once removed/heir-presumptive Matthew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance">unexpectedly inherits</a> a large sum from his late ex-fiancée's father (yes), allowing him to invest in the estate and keep it in the family. Phew.</span>
</li><li> Additionally, numerous one-off characters, all peers and friends of Lord Grantham, are shown to suffer the fate that he narrowly avoided. A major theme of the show is how the aristocracy is transitioning into the modern age, becoming less and less able to enjoy their previous lifestyle as landlords living on massive estates staffed by small armies of servants. At one point, the estate is studied by a government official doing research on aristocratic bankruptcies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poldark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poldark">Poldark</a></em>: The Poldarks are a noble family from Cornwall in the late 18th Century, who have traditionally made their money from farming and mining copper. At this time, Wales was starting to produce more copper: driving down the price. At the same time, smaller farms are being bought to create massive industrial wool farms: wool being the other traditional product of Cornish estates. Combine this with the predatory (and highly discriminatory) judicial system of the time, and things get hairy pretty quickly.

The king's ancestors managed to keep the royal titles but had to earn their own living. The king himself avoided this trope because of excellent investment advice provided by Sherlock's father. However, the king's son has not been so good with money and decided to restore his finances through a royal adoption scheme. He legally adopted more than a dozen wealthy Americans in exchange for thousands of dollars in fees. The adoptees can now legally claim to be princes/princesses. When the king finds out about this scheme he is not amused and on Sherlock's advice, he disowns his son. This revokes any noble titles held by the the son and his heirs and opens up the son to lawsuits from his disgruntled "offspring".

Alternately, their family may have fallen on hard times and they become adventurers to win enough gold and/or glory to restore the family's prestige.
</li><li> Fairly common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, for several reasons. First, there are a lot of wars and a noble's holdings (which can range in size from a manor house to an entire planet) might be attacked and destroyed or conquered. This was especially true during the Clan Invasion, when numerous planets were overrun by the Clans, who operate in a caste-based command economy. Second, nobles sometimes fall out of favor after backing the wrong side in a power struggle or just because whoever's in charge of the Successor State they belong to doesn't like them. Third, quite a few noble titles really aren't worth anything. It's quite possible for someone to be "rewarded" for their services with a barony that consists of a patch of rock that can't be farmed and has no mining or industrial value, thus earning no money.

The Cobblepots were originally quite wealthy, to the point where between them, they and the Waynes pretty much bankrolled the construction of most of Gotham in the 19th Century. They fell into decline because they insisted on competing with the Waynes directly, resulting in their new businesses failing because they were in areas they didn't know how to run properly while the Waynes did, and their old businesses failing because they were being neglected in favor of the poorly run new businesses. Penguin refused to acknowledge his own family's role in their decline and chose to blame it all on the Waynes.

<ul><li> 78-year-old "Big Edie" Beale and her 56-year-old daughter "Little Edie" Beale, subjects of the famous documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens">Grey Gardens</a></em>. Big Edie and Little Edie were members of the very rich Bouvier family. They were, respectively, the aunt and first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Unfortunately, husband/father Perce Beale left them, and Big Edie's father John Bouvier disinherited her, and Little Edie never married. By the time the film finds them, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCatLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCatLady">Crazy Cat Ladies</a> living in a filthy, dilapidated mansion that is all they have left.
</li><li> In the United Kingdom, it was very common for a family with a lot of land to squander it on women, horses, gambling, and alcohol.
<ul><li> Many, many aristocratic families have ended up paupers. A particular example came in the first half of the 19th century: cheap grain from the United States and Canada (and to a lesser extent South America) started to crater the price of food in Britain. While this was good for most British people, it was a disaster for the aristocracy, who were mostly large farmers and earned most of their income from selling grain. They managed to pass the Corn Laws restricting the importation of foreign grain for a time, but eventually these were repealed, and the bottom fell out of the grain market, leaving the fortunes of the British aristocracy to fall with it. Rising wages, inheritance tax and the reduced influence of the House of Lords in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did the rest.
</li><li> This was sometimes resolved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney">marrying into new money families</a>, like an American young lady named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Consuelo</a> Vanderbilt marrying the Duke of Marlborough.
</li><li> Or Jenny Jerome marrying the Duke of Marlborough's uncle, Lord Randolph Churchill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Definitely a marriage that had its effect on history</a>, given that Lord Randolph and Jenny's son was none other than Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Despite his reputation as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman">Quintessential British Gentleman</a>, Winston was very proud of his American heritage, once upbraiding British military brass for insulting the US military in his presence. The fondness for America definitely helped his special relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">FDR</a>, and no doubt his American ancestry contributed to the Congress' decision to grant him honorary citizenship of the United States (the first person so honored).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4nip3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4nip3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4nip3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Churchill would not at that time have been eligible for actual American citizenship through his mother. In the late 19th century, American women who married foreign men generally lost their American citizenship upon marrying, and even if they retained their citizenship they could not pass it on to their children born abroad. It wasn't until 1934 that children born outside the US to an American woman married to a non-American man could inherit U.S. citizenship from their mothers, and until 1978 they had to live in the US for a certain amount of time to claim it. In the event, Churchill never qualified.</span>
</li><li> A couple of notable recent examples of British aristocrats who ended up impoverished were Edward FitzGerald, 7th Duke of Leinster, who was part of one of Ireland's oldest noble families but died by suicide in a bedsit in London in 1976 and Angus Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester, who on his death in 2002 had lived in a flat in Bedford for many years. Ironically, Lord Manchester's great-grandfather had earlier married one of those American heiresses, and that lady was also called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Consuelo</a>.
</li><li> A lot of rich Americans made their way to Britain in the 19th century, creating a lot of Anglo-Americans in the British gentry (the most famous being the aforementioned Winston Churchill). Another famous one is the Astor family, a family of German immigrants to the US who made their fortunes in the US (you may have heard of their hotel in New York, the Waldorf-Astoria...) who managed to not only marry British nobles but have the male line ennobled itself (as the Viscounts Astor). Nancy Astor, the first female MP in Britain and inveterate House of Commons opponent of Churchill <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zws0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5zws0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zws0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Mr Churchill, if you were my husband, I'd put poison in your tea." "Lady Astor, if I were your husband I'd drink it."</span>, was herself an American who married into this family (confusing ain't it).
</li><li> On 1478, George Neville, 1st Duke of Bedford, was stripped from his peerage for lack of money to maintain the style of a duke.
</li><li> Coming at this from the opposite direction, Louis of Battenberg—a junior German prince and son-in-law of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> who decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmigrantPatriotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmigrantPatriotism">become fully British</a> and join the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy</a>—disclaimed all his German titles (and what little German property he had) during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. His nephew George V insisted that Prince Louis be made a British peer in compensation (and in recognition of his skill as a naval officer), and initially wanted to make him a duke; Louis had to beg the king to give him some other peerage, as his only income—his naval salary—was not enough to support the style of a duke. George obliged—but made him a marquess (only one step below duke) to show his gratitude.
</li></ul></li><li> By the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesTheFirst">James the First</a> came to the throne of England in 1603, a century of war and inflation had practically bankrupted the Crown. He quickly began selling knighthoods (and inventing the concept of a baronetcy so he could sell <em>those</em> for <em>more</em> cash) and demanding money from the nobility. The nobility, in turn, were running out of money, increasingly leaning on the rising merchants... You can see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">where this is going</a>, right?
</li><li> Many common last names from Eastern Ireland (such as Fitzgerald, Morell, D'Arcy, Grace, Burke, and Russell) can be traced back to old powerful Anglo-French and Norman noble dynasties who lost all of their wealth, land and power during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> and ended up as poor serfs and farmers under the rule of the Tudors and the plantation system.
</li><li> Many of the early <em>Conquistatores</em> came from landless <em>hidalgo</em> families. When you have all the military training and constrained career choices that other nobles have, but no land, the New World sure seems like the place to be.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Valdivia">Pedro de Valdivia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <em>many</em> other Spanish <em>hidalgos</em> fell into poverty in the Renaissance times and later, so they came to America in search of riches, lands, servants, and specially honor and a name for themselves. The results were... well, varied: some <em>did</em> become famous and powerful, others died in either poverty or the war, etc.
</li><li> Japan:
<ul><li> Happened with a lot of aristocratic families in Japan around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai">Sengoku Jidai</a>, to the point where lords and even emperors were reduced to selling their calligraphy for money. Also, around this time merchants were the ones with all the wealth; unfortunately they were despised and rules had to be made so they wouldn't look wealthier than their betters.
</li><li> In the Tokugawa period, low-ranking samurai could easily be as poor or poorer than the peasants they were supposed to rule over (A key part of this was that the daimyos traditionally paid the samurai in rice, which the samurai would resell for whatever else they needed. When the rise of the merchant class caused the bottom to drop out of the rice market, the buying power of their salaries went down with it even though their pay was technically unchanged). Many went so far as to sell their swords or replace the metal blades with wood or bamboo.
</li><li> Happened yet again in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration">Meiji era</a>, with the (at least outward) abolition of the feudal system. The daimyo (feudal lords) managed okay (for instance, the Tokugawas, who had been overthrown as Shoguns, are today shipping magnates). A lot of the samurai didn't.
</li><li> Some Japanese <em>Emperors</em> were forced to work to pay for their own coronations. One's wife had to sell flowers to pay for her husband's coronation. Since the Japanese Emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">has been little more that a figurehead for centuries</a>, this is hardly surprising.
</li></ul></li><li> Baron Sir Benjamin Slade, the (childless) last scion of a British noble family that had fallen on hard times, famously announced in 2006 that he was holding "open auditions" for an heir who would be able to afford to maintain the house's ancestral holdings after he died. The following year, he named distant cousin Isaac Slade, lead singer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFray">The Fray</a>, as his successor.
</li><li> The Roman Republic was full of them:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> and Lucius Sergius Catilina. Both were pretty fair examples of people who thought that their family's position should have granted them a higher station in life than they actually had and led them to challenge the system. It worked out pretty well for Caesar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">until the end</a>), but less so for Catiline, who would be on the receiving end of one of the greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">condemnatory speeches</a> in human history. There is no real consensus on Catilina. Depictions vary from just another corrupt politician using the poor for his own gain to someone along the line of the Gracchi brothers.
</li><li> Lucius Cornelius Sulla definitely started out as one of these.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> came from a wealthy family that fell into poverty while he was a child. His grandfather was very rich, but after his death his fortune was badly mismanaged by relatives.
</li><li> The descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> (or rather, the descendants of his relatives) fit this trope. One of the (disputed) heirs to the throne has studied management. The other is an economist. Napoleon himself grew up as this.
</li><li> Many, <em>many</em> royal families were overthrown and lost their stuff after the two World Wars:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Tsar Simeon of Bulgaria<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was forced out of Bulgaria when it became a satellite country under the watch of the USSR... and made a comeback by becoming Prime Minister half a century later. He is the only person to have been a hereditary monarch and then an elected head of government. A few others have been both, but usually it's the other way around.
</li><li> While King Peter II of Yugoslavia spent the war in England, the Yugoslavian resistance fractured became between Communist partisans and royalist Chetniks. By the end of the war, the Communists had gained control of the country, and Peter was prohibited from returning. As a monarch in exile, he managed his money poorly and was in frequent need of funds. His wife suffered depression and attempted suicide twice. Peter became an alcoholic and died at the age of 47 from an unsuccessful liver transplant.
</li></ul></li><li> More than one Catholic saint of either gender had a background like this too. For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Hurtado">Saint Alberto Hurtado<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> came from a well-off family, but once his father died when he was a kid his family soon went into bankruptcy and had to sell their land, which was a <strong>big</strong> deal among Chilean elite back then. He went to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScholarshipStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScholarshipStudent">Scholarship Student</a> in both school and university, growing up into a lawyer and Jesuit priest and <em>the</em> advocate for social Christianity in Chile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, whose mother was a Dutch baroness. During the war, her Dutch/Belgian family's property, bank accounts, and even heirlooms were confiscated by the Germans. Audrey and her family suffered greatly from the Dutch famine of the winter of 1944-45, and the effects of malnutrition remained with her all her life.
</li><li> During the 19th century in Spain, nobility lost their privileges, most notably tax exemption. This hit the lower nobility, whom often became landless laborers as a result, particularly hard.
</li><li> The small town Bethlehem during Antiquity. It was known for farmers and shepherds who were descendants of King David.
</li><li> The von Trapp family — yes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> guys. It wasn't in the movie, but it's described in Maria von Trapp's book. Financial difficulties after the "Anschluss" (Annexation of Austria) caused a lot of bank failures — including theirs — and all of Captain von Trapp's savings were wiped out overnight.
</li><li> One of the last members of the Timurid dynasty which ruled Central Asia and India (as the Mughals) is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/5114995/The-Last-Mughals-descendants-to-be-traced.html">a tea vender in Calcutta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Angelo Roncalli's family were sharecroppers, but they descended from a very secondary branch of an Italian noble clan. Angelo himself would go the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> (sorta) way and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope St. John XXIII</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntoineDeSaintExupery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntoineDeSaintExupery">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a> was <em>born</em> to a well-to-do old-money family: his father was a count and an insurance executive (France, having long been a republic, got used to working nobles long before Britain began thinking about it). However, he died when Antoine was 3 years old, leaving the family with far less income. As a result, his mother had to severely cut back in order to send her children to good schools.
</li><li> Pu Yi, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">last ruler of a pan-Chinese Empire</a>, spent time in various prisons and sanitariums after being deposed. After being released from a Communist prison, he was allowed to live in an ordinary residence in Beijing. He spent the last three years of his life working as an editor for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for 100 yuan per month (which was a pretty high pay for 1967 Beijing).
</li><li> Unsurprisingly, impoverished nobles formed the bulk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies">Anarcho-Communism, Communist, and Socialist</a> groups' leadership in Imperial Russia. This is because the middle class was equally prominent among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies">Anarcho-Capitalist, Classic Liberal, and Social Liberal</a> groups and the two kind of hated one another. The countryside-dwelling peasants who made up the vast bulk of the Russian population tended to be suspicious of the Impoverished Patrician-led groups because Anarcho-Communism was basically advocating a way of life (village communes) that they already had but with some unwanted changes (i.e. the collective ownership of all property), Socialism and Communism focused almost exclusively on urban issues, and Communism also was against private property. The Anarchist Bakunin and Communist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> were of noble birth, albeit lesser nobility, as was Felix Dzerzhinsky (the founder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">VCh</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">Ka</a>).
<ul><li> Author Alexey Tolstoy, for example. A member of the famous Tolstoy clan, but quite poor when growing up. After fleeing Russia after the Revolution, he decided that being a poor artist, his aristocratic heritage didn't matter too much, and came back. He became a staunch supporter of Stalin and was considered a major figure in Socialist Realism, although his reputation fell by a lot after the fall of Soviet Union. However, his work of science fiction and children's literature are still regarded fairly highly.
</li><li> Similarly to the Hungarian example below, there existed a whole social class of "Odnodvortsi", or "One-yard nobles"  that is, basically a common farmers with a noble title, usually received as a military award or descended from the minor nobility tasked with the military service, which in 1866 was largely folded into Cossacks. One chief distinction that separated them from common peasants was that they had the right to own land (and sometimes even serfs), even though few held more land than an average serf.
</li><li> After the revolution, some Russian nobles exiled in France ended up as taximen; in Shanghai, they ended up as bodyguards or even <em>caring for running dogs</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Some section of the Hungarian nobility, the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_nobility#Groups_within_the_nobility">nobles with one parcel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> were merely farmers and craftsmen with nobility titles and lived in separate villages.
</li><li> In medieval Poland, nobles were allowed to add a -ski to the end of their family names (the equivalent of an English knight adding a Sir in front of his name). Many of the lower nobility were rather poor which became an issue during the Elective Monarchy period when all the nobles had the right to vote on major laws and who would became the next king. Foreign powers would bribe the lower nobility into voting against the country's best interest which eventually led to Poland being taken apart by its neighbours. Once the nobility lost their power, most people stopped caring about enforcing the naming conventions and many non-nobles added -ski to their names in order to improve their social standing. This was so prevalent that it is mostly impossible to tell on the basis of names alone who is descended from impoverished nobles and who from upstart peasants.
</li><li> The country nobility of France under the Ancien Régime often fell under this. For instance, Louis-Nicolas Davout, future Marshal of the First Empire, could trace his lineage back to the 11th century but he was born in a rented farmhouse.
</li><li> Given the length of time that nobility in some form has existed and the way human populations work, it's safe to assume that very close to <em>every</em> poor person is the descendant of at least <em>one</em> noble house. Be it the Egyptian Pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty, Charlemagne or some chieftain in the Americas a millennium before Columbus. It's just that some people <em>know</em> it and think they're special because of it.
<ul><li> On that note, many Brits and Americans of British descent, including all the U.S. presidents (even Barack Obama), can trace their ancestral lines to William the Conqueror. Of course, not all of them are official members of the Royal Family, and, with the passage of nearly ten centuries, few of them are rich, let alone filthy rich.
</li></ul></li><li> Until his death in October 2016, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigeli_V_of_Rwanda">Kigeli V<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the exiled last king of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rwanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, lived in Section 8 (government) housing in Virginia and received food stamps. During the 1980s while living in Nairobi, <em>tourists gave him schillings</em> in exchange for being allowed to photograph someone who once wore a real crown. His "chambellan" (read: driver), meanwhile, worked at Sears in his 80s.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cherrychapman.com/2018/07/17/monflanquin-a-true-twisted-machiavellian-plot-that-swindled-a-familys-chateau/">Védrines family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, aristocrats ennobled on 1828, became this as a result of being brainwashed by cult guru Thierry Tilly, who met them on 1999 and who pushed a persecution complex on them, while fleecing them. As a result, they lost around 5 millions, including their family castle in Montflanquin, which they owned since <em>four centuries</em>.
