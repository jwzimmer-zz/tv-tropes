<ul><li> Happened when British comedian Tommy Cooper had a heart attack on live TV in 1984. He was declared dead on arrival at the hospital shortly afterward, although going by the video recording on YouTube it (thankfully) seems like he died pretty much within seconds. Since part of Cooper's stage routine involved frequent minor technical mishaps, the audience continued to laugh even as Cooper collapsed, assuming it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">just another gag</a>.
</li><li> Redd Foxx died of a heart attack on the set of his sitcom <em>The Royal Family</em> in 1991. His best-known role was on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em>, which had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about his character faking heart attacks; <em>and</em> the working title for the show he was filming had been <em>Chest Pains</em>. Due to his role as Fred Sanford, the rest of the cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">thought he was just faking it</a> until it was too late. The show tried to continue without Foxx for a few episodes, but it was canceled shortly thereafter.
</li><li> During the late 50s, the British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a> series of one-off plays <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArmchairTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArmchairTheatre">Armchair Theatre</a></em> was broadcast live on Sunday night; during a play called <em>Underground</em> about survivors from a nuclear attack hiding in the London Underground one of the actors, Gareth Jones, had a fatal heart attack when he was just about to make an entrance. The play continued with the other actors covering for his failure to appear, and they managed to improvise right up to the end, with some plot discussion with the director during a commercial break. The actors were not told that Jones had actually died until after the play had finished, but were told only that he was too ill to continue. Sadly, no recording of the play survives, so we can't be sure exactly how this was worked around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter">John Ritter</a> was rehearsing on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules">8 Simple Rules</a></em> in September 2003 when he collapsed with a previously unknown heart problem. He died later that day.
</li><li> Jerome Irving Rodale, author and publisher of <em>Prevention</em> magazine, died during a taping of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickCavettShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickCavettShow">The Dick Cavett Show</a></em> in June 1971. Cavett's next guest, journalist Pete Hamill, heard a snore-like sound from Rodale and tipped Cavett and the staff to check on him. Rodale had <em>suffered a fatal heart attack</em> while sitting on Cavett's couch. The episode never aired. Ironically enough, Rodale made several quips during that very interview that he had "never felt better" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">"planned to live to 100"</a>. He was 72. Legend has it that Cavett said "Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?" after Rodale's snore, but both Cavett and Hamill later denied this; a transcript of the episode cited in Rodale's 1974 biography says Cavett actually asked Rodale if he was alright upon hearing the sound.

Gathers had collapsed during a game earlier in the season and was diagnosed with an abnormal heartbeat. He didn't respond well to medication and LMU's notorious fast-paced offense (which averaged 122 points a game) probably didn't help matters.
<ul><li> Similarly to Gathers' was the Reggie Lewis incident three years later.

However, during Game 1 of the 1993 1st round playoff series against the Charlotte Hornets, Lewis collapsed to the floor. Lewis briefly attempted to return in the 2nd half but was pulled after continued wobbling. He was then hospitalized at New England Baptist Hospital and diagnosed with advanced heart disease, but Lewis, claiming he and his wife weren't given opportunities to discuss the initial diagnosis, transferred to another Boston hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a benign nerve problem. Sadly, two months after the initial collapse Lewis collapsed a second time while shooting baskets at the Celtics practice facility and died soon after.

During a game in October 1862, Creighton suffered a serious injury to his abdomen during a swing but played the rest of the game anyway. After the game, he began to experience severe hemorrhaging, and he would die at his father's home four days later. Modern analysis suggests Creighton died of a ruptured inguinal hernia, and his heavy workload - he threw over 300 pitches per game due to strikes and balls not being called in that era - likely contributed to his death.

<ul><li> George O'Hanlon, who voiced George Jetson in all incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em> up to that point, died of a stroke in the recording studio right after recording some of his lines for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JetsonsTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JetsonsTheMovie">Jetsons: The Movie</a></em> in 1990, after having suffered an initial stroke.

<ul><li> Long-running television actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VicMorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VicMorrow">Vic Morrow</a> and child actors My-Ca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen (both working illegally, without proper work permits and at 2 AM, far later than the times allowed for child actors), were killed when a stunt helicopter crashed near them during the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></em>. This led to nearly a decade's worth of lawsuits, changes in the law about child actors doing stunts, and fewer helicopter scenes in movies thereafter until CGI made it possible to put them in digitally. Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLandis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLandis">John Landis</a> was acquitted of manslaughter charges, but his career went into decline after this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonLee">Brandon Lee</a> was fatally shot on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em> in an accident. A B-unit filming close-up scenes had no professional armorer with them and built their own dummy rounds (for a shot of the cartridges in the revolver) by simply pulling the gunpowder from it. The trigger was pulled at some point, and the force generated by the primer exploding shoved the bullet into the barrel. The same gun was later reloaded with blanks and used for the scene of the murder of Lee's character; nobody had checked the gun and the blank fired the bullet into Brandon Lee's chest.
</li><li> Actor Kevin Smith (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">no relation</a>), best known for playing Ares on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em>, died just after wrapping filming on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarriorsOfVirtue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarriorsOfVirtue">Warriors of Virtue</a> 2</em> when he fell from a prop tower on a nearby set.

</li><li> During the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice">You Only Live Twice</a></em>, John Jordan lost a foot in a helicopter accident. Years later, he was Second Unit Director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em>, and refused a safety harness while filming in an airplane. He was subsequently sucked out of the plane when the door opened and fell to his death.

Scholl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords">Last Words</a>, as his Pitts Special spun past its safe recovery altitude, were, "There's a problem - there's a real problem here."
</li><li> During a production shoot on location in the Philippines for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris">Chuck Norris</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BraddockMissingInActionIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BraddockMissingInActionIII">Braddock: Missing in Action III</a></em>, a Philippine Air Force helicopter hired by the Cannon Film Group crashed into Manila Bay killing four Filipino soldiers and wounding five other people, including a member of the film crew.

</li><li> Famous stunt pilot Paul Mantz was killed in the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlightOfThePhoenix1965" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlightOfThePhoenix1965">The Flight of the Phoenix (1965)</a></em> when he misjudged the rate of descent and crashed into a small hillock.
</li><li> The 1928 production <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark_%281928_film%29">Noah's Ark<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCurtiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCurtiz">Michael Curtiz</a>, had three stuntmen drowning in the scene of the flood (plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">the main actress getting pneumonia, one of the actors breaking two ribs, and an extra needing a leg amputation</a>). This film directly led to the creation of the Screen Actors Guild to prevent such a thing from happening again.
</li><li> In October 2011, stuntman Kun Liu <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15499964">died while filming a stunt for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables2">The Expendables 2</a></em> in Bulgaria.
</li><li> On August 2, 1920, during the filming of the silent film <em>The Skywayman</em>, stunt pilots Ormer Locklear and Milton "Skeets" Elliott were flying a biplane during a nighttime shoot. At the end of the scene, they were supposed to make it look like they crashed the plane. The sky was lit with several floodlights. Locklear had instructed that, because he would not be able to see the ground at night, the floodlights had to be turned off as they approached the ground so he would know to pull up. For some reason, this instruction was ignored. Locklear and Elliott died when the plane hit the ground going at full throttle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaBassett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaBassett">Angela Bassett</a>'s stunt double fell to her death on the set of the 1995 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VampireInBrooklyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VampireInBrooklyn">Vampire in Brooklyn</a></em>.
</li><li> H.B. Halicki was crushed by a telephone pole felled by a broken cable during the filming of an unfinished sequel to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneInSixtySeconds1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneInSixtySeconds1974">Gone in Sixty Seconds</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XXx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XXx">xXx</a></em>, stuntman Harry O'Connor was killed when he crashed into the side of Palacky Bridge instead of going under it. The footage, up to the point where he disappears behind one of the bridge columns, was used in the final film. The director points it out in the commentary.
</li><li> Roy Kinnear died after accidentally falling from his horse on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheMusketeers">The Return of the Musketeers</a></em>.
</li><li> A stuntman died during the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRightStuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRightStuff">The Right Stuff</a></em>. He was in the scene where Chuck Yeager bails out of a crashing F-104 prototype. There are conflicting reports on it, but his helmet filled with smoke, which either knocked him out, and prevented him from opening the chute, or screwed up his sense of when to open it.
</li><li> Stuntman Paolo Rigonu became the first fatality on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> movie when he was killed when the bobsled he was driving overturned while shooting a chase scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">For Your Eyes Only</a></em>.
</li><li> During filming of a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneFishin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneFishin">Gone Fishin'</a></em> where a boat was supposed to jump over a ramp, fly over a hedge of mangroves, land between two other boats, and stop in the water, the boat slid off the side of the ramp, flipped over, and landed on a crowd of crew and extras, killing stuntwoman Janet Peters Wilder, and injuring both her husband Scott Wilder and his father Glenn R. Wilder.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerDelgado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerDelgado">Roger Delgado</a>, during the filming of <em>Bell of Tibet</em> in Turkey, was killed with two Turkish film technicians while riding in a car that plunged off the road into a ravine. This deeply affected his close friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>, who was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">Third Doctor</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> at the time of the accident, with Delgado playing his archenemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaster">the Master</a>. Two years later, Pertwee left the role and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> took over. However, Delgado's untimely demise made it difficult to bring back the Master, and he did not return for several more years until his role was eventually recast to Peter Pratt, with the Master returning as a decrepit husk of his former self.
</li><li> <em>Midnight Rider</em>, an adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand">Gregg Allman</a>'s autobiography, ended up being shelved due to this. After filming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> scene illegally on a train track which involved actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHurt">William Hurt</a> lying on a hospital gurney, the cast and crew tried to remove the equipment from the track before an oncoming train approached their filming location when the hospital gurney got stuck on the track. When the train hit the gurney, second camera assistant Sarah Jones was in turn struck by the gurney before being propelled by the recoil into the train's path where she was struck again, dying instantly. Hurt, who was on the gurney before the train hit it, was able to run to safety. The accident wouldn't have occurred had director Randall Miller listened to others that the scene was too dangerous to film at the location he'd picked, or if he had simply arranged with a railroad company somewhere to film the scene legally at a time when trains weren't running or on a track that wasn't active. Hurt quit the film a month later, while Allman was outraged by the incident and sued the production to stop the film from being completed. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">OSHA investigation</a> on the incident led to Miller being charged with manslaughter and the film being canned.
</li><li> Silent film actress Martha Mansfield died from burns sustained on the set of <em>The Warrens of Virginia</em> in 1923. She was burned when a carelessly tossed cigarette ignited her frilly Civil War-era dress.
</li><li> In 1907, the Clarendon Film Company attempted to shoot a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARailway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARailway">Chained to a Railway</a> scene with a local resident, Mr. Zeitz, playing the part of the victim. Thanks to a series of communication errors, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bromley-coppard.com/Stoatsnest/">Zeitz was run over by the train and killed.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2">Deadpool 2</a></em>, stuntwoman Joi SJ Harris was killed when she lost control of her motorcycle and crashed into a building.
</li><li> Rob Stewart, creator of the documentaries <em>Sharkwater</em> and <em>Revolution</em>, disappeared on February 4, 2017 while on a deep-sea dive filming for a sequel to <em>Sharkwater</em> at the wreck of the <em>Queen of Nassau</em>. Two days later, his body was found about 300 feet from where he went missing.
</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilTheFinalChapter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilTheFinalChapter">Resident Evil: The Final Chapter</a></em>, a crewman was hit by a US Army Hummer and crushed.
</li><li> A stunt performer drowned off the coast of Malibu during the filming of the skydiving sequence in wacky sex comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DontMakeWaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DontMakeWaves">Don't Make Waves</a></em>.
</li><li> Sound director James Emswiller died of a two-story fall during filming of the biopic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulDayInTheNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulDayInTheNeighborhood">A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</a></em> after suffering a heart attack on set.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter">Steve Irwin</a> was filming his own documentary, <em>Ocean's Deadliest,</em> when he was fatally stabbed in the chest by a stingray spine while snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef. Irwin was completely unaware of the stingray's presence until it stabbed him. The episode being filmed wasn't about stingrays. And stingrays aren't even all that dangerous; they're usually quite docile unless you step on one. Even then, while painful, the sting isn't deadly. It just happened to stab him in the heart, and on top of that Irwin instinctively pulled the stinger out, leading him to bleed to death.
</li><li> Stuntman Tip Tipping was killed when his parachute failed to open while he was filming an episode of the British series <em>999</em>, which was - ironically enough - a show with the premise of reenacting dangerous accidents.
</li><li> Boris Sagal, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOmegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOmegaMan">The Omega Man</a></em> and father of actress Katey Sagal, died like Vic Morrow; he was nearly decapitated when he walked into a helicopter blade during the filming of the miniseries <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldWarIII">World War III</a></em>.
</li><li> In 1986, a man named Michael Lush fell to his death while rehearsing a bungee stunt for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VarietyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VarietyShow">Variety Show</a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Late,_Late_Breakfast_Show">The Late Late Breakfast Show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which included an item called "the Whirly Wheel" in which audience members were trained to do a different stunt each week. The death followed at least two potentially-fatal screw-ups involving earlier contestants, which had been covered up or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (one woman was injured doing a human cannonball act, and a car jumping act led to one vehicle crashing into a crowd, and a second landing on its roof and leaving the contestant with multiple injuries). The show was canceled immediately and the scandal nearly ruined presenter Noel Edmonds' career. Lush's death prompted a serious tightening of safety regulations for all stunt sequences on BBC shows and a total ban on dangerous stunts involving members of the public.
</li><li> Actor Ken Steadman died when he flipped a dune buggy on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em>.
</li><li> TV actor Jon-Erik Hexum accidentally killed himself in 1984 with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFakePropWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFakePropWeapon">blank cartridge</a> on the set of the CBS series <em>Cover-Up</em> by firing it into the side of his head. He was goofing around with the prop in an attempt to lighten the mood on set, and apparently, he either thought the gun had been unloaded between takes or was simply unaware that blanks were still dangerous when fired at close range. The muzzle pressure generated by the blank proved sufficient to blow a plug of his own skull completely through his brain in much the same way some nail guns use blank cartridges to drive nails into concrete and steel. The show continued the rest of its first season with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">new actor playing a new character</a> replacing Hexum's, but was not renewed by the network.
</li><li> A jeep crane driver was killed during the filming of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KraftSuspenseTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KraftSuspenseTheatre">Kraft Suspense Theatre</a></em> episode "The Jack Is High".
</li><li> In 1990, magician Joe Burrus attempted to replicate one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a>'s most dangerous trick: escaping from a coffin while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">Buried Alive</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23b50');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23b50" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23b50');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not even Houdini was able to pull off that particular trick, nearly dying in his attempt</span>. He would be bound in a straitjacket, handcuffed, and chained in a Plexiglas coffin that was buried under dirt and concrete, the intent being to escape from the coffin and emerge from the wet cement. Unfortunately, the dirt and concrete were far too heavy for the coffin, which <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Go4FwvpVQ">collapsed, the cement crushing him to death<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> During production of the season 8 premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, one crew member was killed and six others were injured when a power line struck a scaffolding, sending a 4,800-volt charge through the 15-foot-high structure.
</li><li> Brazilian soap opera star Domingos Montagner <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37381477">drowned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after he decided to take a swim in a river near where the soap <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VelhoChico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VelhoChico">Velho Chico</a></em> was being shot after a day of filming, but he quickly found himself overcome by the currents. One of his co-stars tried calling for help as he was swept downstream but the locals apparently thought that they were shooting a scene from the soap and did nothing to help.
</li><li> In Phoenix, Arizona on July 27, 2007, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Phoenix_news_helicopter_collision">two helicopters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from stations KTVK and KNXV-TV collided in mid-air over a public park while covering a police pursuit, killing all four: pilot Scott Bowerback and photographer Jim Cox in the KTVK chopper, pilot Craig Smith and photographer Rick Krolak on the KNXV side. Smith's last words were "Oh jeez!" right before the crash.
</li><li> In 2015, during the filming of a French "wilderness survival" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow">Reality Show</a> called <em>Dropped</em>, three contestants - all French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic medallists</a>, Florence Arthaud (sailing), Camille Muffat (swimming), and Alexis Vastine (boxing) - and seven crew members were killed when two helicopters taking them to a filming location collided with each other and crashed with no survivors. The show was immediately canceled with the completed first episode never broadcast.
</li><li> In June 2019, Filipino actor Eddie Garcia was rushed to the hospital after tripping on a cable wire and hitting his head on the pavement while he was shooting a scene for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GMANetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GMANetwork">GMA Network</a>'s upcoming TV series, <em>Rosang Agimat</em>. Garcia suffered neck and cervical injuries from the fall and died 12 days later. This led the Department of Labor and Employment <a class="urllink" href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1133247/labor-group-hails-probe-of-actor-eddie-garcias-death">to investigate whether GMA Network followed OSH standards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after it was noted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">there was no medical team or safety officer during the time of the shooting</a>.
</li><li> New Orleans television reporter Nancy Parker was killed in a plane crash in August 2019 while filming a news segment on pioneering stunt plane pilot Franklin Augustus, who was also killed in the crash.
</li><li> Daredevil and flat Earth conspiracy theorist "Mad" Mike Hughes was killed in the February 2020 crash of his homemade steam-powered rocket. The launch was being filmed for the Science Channel series <em>Homemade Astronauts</em>. Hughes had been attempting to launch himself in his rocket for years in his attempts to prove his beliefs but had been blocked several times because he refused to test his vehicle or file for permits, and his only two successful launches had proven to be life-threatening: He was seriously injured from the first attempt in 2014 and made a hard landing on the second attempt in 2018.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rawhide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rawhide">Rawhide</a></em> star Eric Fleming was accidentally drowned in 1966 while filming <em>High Jungle</em>, an installment of the short-lived ABC anthology series <em>Off to See the Wizard</em>. During a location shoot on the Huallaga River in Peru, the canoe Fleming and co-star Nico Minardos were riding in capsized and overturned. Minardos was able to swim to safety, but Fleming was swept away by the current and drowned. <em>High Jungle</em> was never completed.

<ul><li> Legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">stock car racer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> died on February 18, 2001, on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, one of the most televised races in NASCAR history, when Sterling Marlin took the air off his spoiler and caused him to lose control, hooking on the front of Ken Schrader's car and smashing headlong into the wall at 155 to 160 MPH and suffering a fatal basilar skull fracture. He was the fourth NASCAR driver in nine months killed by a basilar skull fracture, after Adam Petty (May 2000), Kenny Irwin Jr. (July 2000), and Tony Roper (October 2000), all of whom were killed in similar crashes. The death of Earnhardt was the last straw for NASCAR, who mandated the Head and Neck Restraint (HANS device) for all drivers, installed the SAFER barrier at all tracks, and created the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_of_Tomorrow">Car of Tomorrow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In October of the same year as Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash, ARCA racer Blaise Alexander attempted to pass Kerry Earnhardt (Dale Earnhardt's son, and Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s older half-brother) for the lead of the race, and as he came up past Kerry, he collided with Kerry's fender and got turned up into the wall, smashing headlong into it, and flipping Kerry's car. Kerry Earnhardt was unhurt but Blaise suffered a fatal basilar skull fracture in the wreck. This crash caused HANS devices to become mandatory in ARCA races.
</li><li> In 1994 triple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> champion Ayrton Senna died on lap seven of the San Marino Grand Prix. His car failed to negotiate a fast left-hand corner (possibly through steering failure, although the cause has never been fully determined) and he went straight into a wall. Though what killed him wasn't the force of the crash but the wheel's suspension parts that flew back and hit his crash helmet. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital but didn't survive. That same weekend rookie Roland Ratzenberger died in another high-speed accident and Rubens Barrichello was injured in yet another. The FIA ordered redesigns of the track and more developments in car safety.
</li><li> During the last race of the 2011 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> season, Dan Wheldon - who had won the Indianapolis 500 that year - was involved in a major accident that flung his car cockpit-first into the catch fence, tearing away the safety hoop and giving Dan unsurvivable head injuries. He died later that day, and the race was canceled after 12 laps due to Wheldon's death and how long it was taking to make repairs; the accident was one of the most violent in recent memory. The race was held at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which IndyCar had not raced at for years, and in that time, the track had been reconfigured specifically for NASCAR. Factors included the narrowness of the track and the simple fact that there were 34 cars (keep in mind, this is bigger than the Indianapolis 500 field). The huge pack that quickly formed, combined with several rookies racing on a track they had zero experience on, conspired to create a massive 15-car pileup, killing Wheldon, seriously injuring Will Power, J.R. Hildebrand, and Pippa Mann, and severely damaging both the catch fence and the racing surface itself.
</li><li> MotoGP rider Marco Simoncelli died after an incident during the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix just a week after the death of Dan Wheldon. He lost control of his motorcycle and had already gone to the run-off area (with Simoncelli holding on its side) when the bike suddenly regained its grip and cut back across the track into the path of other riders and was struck in the head and neck by Valentino Rossi, and in the chest by Colin Edwards; with Rossi's impact resulting in his helmet becoming dislodged. The race was stopped and then canceled after the extent of Simoncelli's injuries became apparent. He died in the circuit's medical center after 45 minutes of CPR.
</li><li> During the 2010 San Marino Motorcycle Grand Prix, Moto2 rider Shoya Tomizawa was fatally injured when he fell down in the track's very fast right-hand turn right in front of two other riders, Scott Redding and Alex de Angelis. The two ended up running over Tomizawa, as there was no other way to go when Tomizawa fell down.
</li><li> During the second practice session of 2016 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, Moto2 rider Luis Salom lost his life when he fell down at the Europcar corner. As the bike hit the air-fences and bounced upwards, Salom ended up sliding directly underneath it, resulting in the bike crushing Salom's body. The practice session was stopped immediately and he was rushed to the hospital, but he died at 16:50 local time. As a result, the event temporarily switched to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> layout to reduce speed in the part where Salom crashed, before said track layout changes were made mandatory in the following season. Following safety improvements, the Europcar corner was reinstated to the circuit in 2018.
</li><li> The 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> broke its streak of nearly thirty years without a fatal crash during the race and sixteen years without a fatal crash during the event as a whole when driver Allan Simonsen lost control of his Aston Martin Vantage GTE and smashed into the Armco barrier, driver side first, at speeds approaching 105 miles an hour, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lhCiyaPTTs">demolishing the car<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and suffering a fatal aortal separation. It is likely he would have survived the accident if the spot where he hit the barrier had not had a mature, solid tree on the other side.
</li><li> A week before Allan Simonsen's death, former NASCAR driver Jason Leffler was fatally injured when his sprint car rolled over several times causing severe blunt force injuries to his neck. He died a few hours later.
</li><li> The deadliest accident in motorsport history took place during the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Pierre Levegh's Mercedes-Benz went out of control due to a glancing collision, crashed into a stand full of spectators at high speed, and caught fire, fuelled by the high magnesium content in the bodywork. Levegh and 83 spectators were killed, driving significant safety improvements in motor racing.
</li><li> Top Fuel Funny Car racer Scott Kalitta was killed in 2008 when his car's engine exploded during a qualifying run, preventing his parachutes from deploying and causing his car to crash into a concrete pillar at 300mph.
</li><li> On August 9, 2014, during a dirt race in Canandaigua, New York, Sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr. was angrily pointing at NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, who was also racing at the track that night (Stewart had knocked him into the wall) while standing in the middle of the track, when Stewart struck and killed him, briefly dragging his body under his sprint car.
</li><li> In 2009, during a Formula 2 race, Jack Clarke spun out and hit a tree, sending his wheel assembly bouncing across the track. Said assembly hit Henry Surtees square in the head, causing injuries that he succumbed to later that day.
</li><li> During the 2014 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> Japanese Grand Prix, Adrian Sutil lost control of his car in heavy rain and crashed. He was unhurt, but while his car was being retrieved by a crane, Jules Bianchi lost control at the same spot and crashed into the crane, suffering head injuries that he ultimately succumbed to in July 2015. The drivers had been split on whether the race should have continued as long as it had, because the track was still soaked and it was getting dark and hard to see where the puddles were. (To make matters more galling, many of the support races had been moved to earlier in the day because a <em>typhoon</em> was predicted to make landfall, but not the F1 race itself.) Bianchi's death prompted the FIA to introduce the "halo" head protection device starting in 2018.
</li><li> On August 23, 2015 <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> driver Justin Wilson suffered a massive head injury when the nosecone on Sage Karam's car came off when he hit the wall and hit Wilson in the head. He died the next day, prompting renewed calls for open-wheel cars to have closed cockpits, being the latest in a series of incidents where drivers have suffered head injuries from being hit by objects and coming less than two months after Bianchi's death (see above).
</li><li> NHRA driver Darrell Russell was killed in 2004 after a tire blew out on his dragster, splitting it into three pieces and sending metal shrapnel from the engine into his head.
</li><li> Three-time Indy 500 driver Bryan Clauson was killed in a midget car race in August 2016, when his car clipped a lapped car and rolled over several times, followed by being hit by another car. He had been trying to run 200 races that year and died in his 119th.
</li><li> The death of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChampCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChampCar">Champ Car</a> driver Greg Moore at the final race of 1999 at Fontana Motor Speedway was a collection of ironies - after a season saddled with an uncompetitive Mercedes engine, Moore was due to join Penske for 2000 - they ultimately won the next two titles. On the Friday of the meeting Moore was knocked off his scooter in a paddock accident, fracturing his hand - he was only cleared to drive (from the back of the grid) on the morning of the race. On lap ten he lost control, left the track, went across an access road, and the car barrel-rolled, with the car's Black Box registering the impact at 154g. Moore was pronounced dead during the race, although the teams weren't informed until later.
</li><li> While the minimally restricted Group B was already on thin ice in 1986 after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty">three spectators were killed in a rally earlier that year</a>, as well as the death of Attilio Bettega in 1985, it was ultimately done in by the deaths of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto at the 1986 Tour de Corse in Corsica, when their Lancia Delta S4 left the road and rolled down the hill several times, bursting into flames. The two were burned to death, unable to get out of their car, which was made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">kevlar reinforced plastic over an aluminum roll cage</a>, which burned so rapidly and so hot that the car was unrecognizable as one when rescuers finally got there (though reports indicate it took them half an hour to get there).
</li><li> One of the more gruesome deaths in motorsport was that of NASCAR Sportsman Division driver Russell Phillips in 1995. The accident involved his car being shoved roof-first against the track's catch fence and ground at high-speed. The roof was quickly sheared away, leaving Phillips to be literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">torn apart</a> by the force.
</li><li> In the 1996 Dakar Rally, Laurent Gueguen, driving a Mercedes support truck, got caught up in a fight between the Moroccan army and rebels, then hit a landmine, causing his truck to explode and killing him instantly. His co-drivers survived.
</li><li> On August 31, 2019, French Formula 2 driver Antoine Hubert was killed in an accident at Spa Francorchamps, when his car hit a barrier trying to avoid a spinning car and bounced back into traffic, followed by being t-boned by American Juan Manuel Correa who had nowhere to go, utterly destroying both cars. The race was immediately red-flagged, then canceled shortly thereafter, due to the injuries suffered by Hubert. Correa himself only narrowly survived.
</li><li> In 2019 Afridza Munandar, racing in the Asia Talent Cup, a feeder series for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotoGP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotoGP">Moto GP</a>, was killed after making contact with another rider and going down on a first-lap crash at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia.
</li><li> You don't even need to be a driver to risk dying in motorsport:
<ul><li> During the last race of the 1990 NASCAR season, while coming down pit road, Ricky Rudd spun out and accidentally crushed Bill Elliott's right rear tire changer Mike Ritch between their two cars, fatally injuring him. This incident led to the implementation of pit road speed limits in NASCAR.
</li><li> On the first lap of the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello and Heinz-Harald Frentzen collided at the <em>Variante della Roggia</em> chicane, then struck Jarno Trulli and David Coulthard, eliminating all four cars. A wheel that had been torn from one of the cars<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ddhv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ddhv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ddhv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">reports vary as to whether it came off Frentzen's car or Trulli's</span> struck fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti, killing him instantly. Just four races later, at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix, Jacques Villeneuve ran into the back of Ralf Schumacher; his right-rear wheel detached, flew through a narrow gap in the catch fencing, and struck track marshal Graham Beveridge, who was also killed instantly. As a direct result of these incidents, the FIA increased both the strength and the number of tethers on each wheel, to stop them flying off so easily during crashes.
</li><li> At the 1977 South African Grand Prix, track marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce were both killed when Pryce's car collided with Jansen van Vuuren at 270 km/h as he was rushing across the track to extinguish a burning car driven by Renzo Zorzi. Jansen van Vuuren's fire extinguisher then hit Pryce in the face, wrenching his helmet upwards sharply and breaking his neck.

<ul><li> Les Harvey, the guitarist for Scottish rock band Stone the Crows, was electrocuted live on stage in 1972. During a soundcheck, he took hold of a microphone; unfortunately, his hand was covered in sweat (which, given its salt content, is a great conductor). A roadie tried to save him by unplugging the amp, but the damage was done. An accident very like this one - possibly based on it, possibly a coincidence - featured in an educational film for young children about the dangers of electricity in the mid-'90s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CurtisMayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CurtisMayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a>: equipment falling on him caused severe injuries. He was paralyzed from the neck down though he continued to record. His paralysis, as well as diabetes, eventually caused his death, but it would take 9 years. He still recorded one more album, <em>New World Order</em>, entirely on his back (so that he had enough breath to do vocals).
</li><li> Bill Duffield, the lighting director for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush">Kate Bush</a>'s 1979 Tour of Life, died when he fell through the rigging and onto the stage shortly before the tour's first performance in Poole, England. His death deeply affected Bush and is often rumored to be one of the reasons she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">stopped touring</a> for thirty-five years after the Tour of Life finished.
</li><li> Ty Longley, guitarist for the band Great White was on stage in West Warwick, Rhode Island when pyrotechnics used by the band's crew created a spray of sparks that ignited the foam soundproofing material in the ceiling around the stage. 100 people died in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire">the resulting fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, including Longley.
</li><li> Scott Johnson, the drum technician for the British rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> was killed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18479402">in a stage collapse in Toronto in June 2012<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The band was about to start their soundcheck, and the collapse happened only an hour before a sold-out concert was to start. Radiohead spent several years urging for a criminal investigation into Johnson's death and were <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/judge-halts-radiohead-stage-collapse-trial-w501369">not<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/radiohead-press-for-justice-in-delayed-case-of-dead-tech-w512991">happy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when proceedings were first delayed and then stalled altogether.
</li><li> The French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully accidentally stabbed his own foot while beating time on the floor with a heavy stick during a musical performance. The wound became infected and he died from gangrene.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/tragic-singer-bitten-cobra-stage-7699476">Indonesian singer Irma Bule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was famous for "wearing" snakes during her performances. In April 2016, Bule danced with a king cobra that had not been defanged and stepped on its tail by accident. The cobra bit her and she died less than an hour later.
</li><li> In 2015, the Romanian metal band Goodbye to Gravity were performing a free concert at the club Colectiv to celebrate the release of their <em>Mantras of War</em> album when the stage pyrotechnics set off a fire. The club's owners had deliberately ignored fire-safety regulations, and so the fire spread rapidly. 65 people died, including all members of the band except for lead vocalist Andrei Galut. Colectiv's owners were arrested on various charges following the fire.
</li><li> In July 2017, up and coming French singer Barbara Weldens died onstage, after being electrocuted by a faulty piece of equipment she stepped on while performing barefoot in the French village of Gourdon. Making it more tragic was the fact that she had released her first album, to massive critical acclaim in her home country, in February of that year.
</li><li> Will Sinnott, the bassist for the British alternative dance group The Shamen, drowned off the coast of Tenerife in 1991 while on break from filming the band's video for the song "Move Any Mountain". The band completed the video and dedicated it to his memory.
</li><li> R&amp;B singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a> died in a plane crash while leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBahamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBahamas">The Bahamas</a> after filming the music video for "Rock The Boat". It becomes a little chilling watching the making-the-video special she filmed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET">BET</a>; the end where she bids the BET crew farewell and leaves the set was the last time she was seen alive on camera.
</li><li> The Indonesian pop-rock band Seventeen was hosting a concert at a beach in Tanjung Lesung in December 2018, when an unexpected <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Sunda_Strait_tsunami">major tsunami<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from a volcano hit the beach on which they were performing, killing three of the band's four members (the sole survivor was lead vocalist Ifan) and their manager.
</li><li> Young country artist Justin Carter was killed in a music video shoot when a loaded gun in his pocket wound up going off and hitting him next to his eye.
</li><li> On September 1, 2019, Spanish singer Joana Sainz García was killed during a performance with the Super Hollywood Orchestra at a concert in Las Berlanas when the pyrotechnics malfunctioned and hit her. She was later pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> fell to his death in the Kemper Arena during WWE's <em>Over the Edge</em> pay-per-view show in 1999, while preparing for a big stunt entrance that would see him, as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> parody character The Blue Blazer, being lowered in from the rafters. He had done so in a rehearsal earlier in the day with no problems, but unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>'s harness circa 1997, which had multiple connection points and a full vest that took a good amount of time to remove once he actually landed, Owen's contraption was held with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">a single release point around his chest</a> that could be (and probably was) triggered simply by breathing too deeply. Regardless, he ended up falling nearly seventy-eight feet while being lowered, where his chest impacted the top rope. He managed to survive until arriving at the hospital but was soon after pronounced dead from a severed blood vessel near the heart.
<ul><li> Morbidly and sadly ironic in that, rumor has it, he was <em>supposed</em> to fall and look like a doofus as part of the work, except from a much shorter and safer height (and falling on the mat, not the top rope). Sadly, to accomplish this, a harness without safety backups had to be used, otherwise, the stunt could not be performed properly.
</li><li> This led to a series of disputes and lawsuits between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s company and the Hart family. The latter was divided into two camps, and the bitterness got to the point where one side faxed important case information to Vince, which forced a settlement.
</li><li> DC101 radio show personality Bryan "Flounder" Schlossberg conducted a phone interview with wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> shortly afterward. Flounder mentioned Hart's death, with Roberts' reaction showing this was the first time he had heard; Roberts abruptly said goodbye and hung up at that point.

This is part Medical in that Misawa had taken many neck, head and upper shoulder bumps like the one for this move for many years and never got his neck checked out for exams or took an extended leave of absence, leaving his neck in a very weakened state. He had also been complaining about neck pains and numbness since earlier that year and maybe the previous one.
</li><li> On May 28, 2001, during a training session, Dalip Singh (The Great Khali) hit Brian Ong with a move called the flapjack, but Brian suffered a concussion and died. <em>All-Pro Wrestling</em> was found liable because the two did not train with protective padding and Brian had been ordered to continue training by the higher-ups despite having suffered a previous concussion.
</li><li> On March 21, 2015, in <em>AAA</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> attempted to set up Perro Aguayo Jr. for his patented 619 maneuver, but Aguayo's neck snapped when it hit the ropes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan">Konnan</a> tried to revive him, but Aguayo was pronounced dead in the hospital a few hours later.

Her last words were, "The outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you. In New Jersey... Hit the water! Hit the water!" It's likely that she yelled for her pilot to hit the water because six months earlier she had been in a similar helicopter crash while doing a traffic report. That helicopter crashed into the Hackensack River in New Jersey. Both she and her pilot survived and were able to swim to shore. However, in the second crash, the helicopter clipped a chain-link fence and flipped over, trapping Dornacker and her pilot underwater in the Hudson River (her pilot was seriously injured, but survived). Sadly, the accident also orphaned Dornacker's teenage daughter, whose father had died three months prior.

<ul><li> There are many incidents of athletes dying during competition from either accidents or medical reasons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> lists these <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Deaths_in_sport">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sportspeople_who_have_died_during_their_playing_career">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (although the latter list also includes athletes who died during their career, but not during competition).
</li><li> Boxing has a high death toll for obvious reasons. One of the more infamous boxing deaths was that of Duk Koo Kim, who collapsed into a coma on his stool <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">moments after getting knocked out</a> by Ray Mancini in 1982. He was taken off in a stretcher and was pronounced brain dead in the hospital soon after. The fight had been nationally televised in America by CBS.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZk0F5EeRWA">On February 6, 1994<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Sgt. Dana Bowman and Sgt. Jose Aguillon, members of the US Army's elite Golden Knights skydiving team, were performing a Diamond Track maneuver<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53wjh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53wjh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53wjh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">where two jumpers streak away from each other for about a mile, then turn 180 and fly back towards each other, criscrossing</span>, but flew too close and collided with each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">at a combined speed of 300 mph</a>. Aguillon was killed instantly by the impact; Bowman, although having his legs sheared off, survived.
<ul><li> On August 14, 2015, another Golden Knights skydiver, Sgt. 1st Class Corey Hood, collided with Timmy Holland of the US Navy Leap Frogs during a "bomb burst" group maneuver at the Chicago Air and Water Show, and was knocked unconscious; some witnesses thought it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">All Part of the Show</a>. Although Hood's reserve chute deployed, he struck a building, falling thirty stories, and died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital that afternoon. By contrast, Holland only suffered a broken leg upon landing at North Avenue Beach.
</li></ul></li><li> On August 16, 1920, Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was hit in the head by a pitch from the New York Yankees' Carl Mays and died of a massive skull fracture the following day. The ball was very dirty, making it incredibly hard to see and much heavier. This was before the days of batting helmets too. He is one of only two major league players killed by an on-field injury in major league baseball history. The other such fatality is Philadelphia Athletics catcher Doc Powers, who in 1909 crashed into a wall chasing a pop-up and died two weeks later from post-operative peritonitis related to the injury.
</li><li> Mike Coolbaugh was the first-base coach for the Tulsa Drillers, a Double-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. On July 22, 2007, during a game against the Arkansas Travelers (Double-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels), a foul line-drive hit by the Drillers' Tino Sanchez hit Coolbaugh in the neck, crushing his left vertebral artery and causing a fatal brain bleed. As a direct result of this incident, Major League Baseball now requires all base coaches to wear helmets.
</li><li> American football players who have died of injuries suffered during a game include <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Glenn">two<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Johnson">players<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the American Football League who died of neck injuries during the early 1960s, and Arena Football League player <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Lucas_(American_football)">Al Lucas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who also died of a neck injury in 2005.
</li><li> There have been several players who have been killed during college football games since the 1890s, although these slowed considerably after the 1920s and the game evolved into a less brutal form. Fatal incidents on the field have been extremely rare since the mid-1960s, with the most prominent cases being those of University of Arkansas tackle Claude Smithey in 1966 and University of Akron tight end Chris Angeloff in 1975. When Midwestern State University cornerback Robert Grays Jr. died of a neck injury during a game in September 2017, he was the first college player to die in a game since 1990.
</li><li> One NHL hockey player has died as a result of injuries on the ice. In 1968, Bill Masterton of the Minnesota North Stars fell backward and hit his head on the ice after being checked. Before he lost consciousness he was heard to whisper "Never again. Never again." Masterton died two days later without regaining consciousness. He was not wearing a helmet; it would be 11 more years before the NHL made helmets mandatory. The Bill Masterton Trophy is now given to players who exhibit "perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lud&lt;!--C4--&gt;9Bk_&lt;!--C4--&gt;8Cajka">Ludek Cajka's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> death in 1990 from a broken neck in a Czechoslovakian league hockey game resulted in the changing of the icing rule in hockey to no-touch throughout almost all of European hockey for 15 years. Interestingly, while most leagues overseas do still use it, the Czech Republic has returned to touch icing starting in 2005.
</li><li> Although the <em>X Games</em> has portrayed several incredibly violent-looking wipeouts, only once has such an accident resulted in death: Caleb Moore died of injuries sustained from a snowmobile stunt wreck at the 2013 Winter Games in Aspen. Made even more gut-wrenching in that he <em>walked away</em> from that wreck.
</li><li> While not as noticeable as human athletes, racehorses, particularly thoroughbreds, have a very high propensity to accidents that lead to their deaths while racing. Current breeding of thoroughbreds has led to animals with incredibly strong muscles, but bones that are fragile. Pretty much any broken bone, even a fracture, in any leg of a horse leads to euthanasia. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.horsedeathwatch.com/">This site, in particular, has sobering statistics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> One of the most notable came during the 2008 Kentucky Derby. Eight Belles, a filly which had just finished in second place, collapsed from exhaustion and suffered serious ankle fractures. She was euthanized right on the track, in front of spectators and the live television audience, before the race was even finished.
</li><li> Santa Anita Raceway in Southern California became infamous for horse deaths in 2019 after 26 horses died or had to be euthanized in six months. Reviews of the racing surface and safety policies revealed no obvious cause either.
</li></ul></li><li> In ancient Rome, death during chariot races was so routine that it was considered part of the show. The result was that the Catholic Church actually refused to baptize chariot racers and anyone who was associated with chariot races and imposed strict penances for watching a chariot race.
</li><li> In a freak accident (as in the injury it caused was very rare and only one other case resulted from a cricket ball), Cricketer Phillip Hughes was struck in the neck by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott, leading to internal bleeding; he died in hospital 2 days later.
<ul><li> Just short of a year later, Namibian cricketer Raymond van Schoor suffered a stroke while playing in the South African domestic 50-over competition, leaving him in a coma; he passed away in hospital 5 days later.
</li></ul></li><li> On September 10th, 1983, American tennis linesman Dick Wertheim was officiating at the 1983 US Open when an errant serve by a then 17-year-old Stefan Edberg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">struck him in the groin</a>... and caused him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver">fall out of his chair backward, then hit his head on the hardcourt</a>. He died in the hospital five days later.
</li><li> Cycling can be a dangerous sport, with long and fast descents, proximity to motorcycles and a drug problem that the sport has been trying to end.
<ul><li> On May 9th, 2011, Belgian cyclist Wouter Weylandt died during stage 3 of Giro d'Italia, crashing on the descent of Passo del Bocco.
</li><li> On August 26, 1960, Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed while participating in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and suffered a fatal skull fracture. It later emerged that he had been taking a cocktail of drugs including amphetamine and nicotinyl alcohol prior to the fatal collapse, making his death one of the first major doping scandals in the sport's history.
</li><li> On July 13th, 1967, British cyclist Tom Simpsons died during stage 13 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a>, cycling up Mont Ventoux. The official cause of death was heart failure caused by exhaustion. He had taken amphetamines and alcohol prior to the incident.
</li><li> On July 14th, 1935, Spanish cyclist Francisco Cepeda died during Tour de France, crashing while making the descent from Col du Galibier.
</li><li> On July 18th, 1995, Italian cyclist Fabio Casartelli died during stage 15 of Tour de France, crashing on the descent from Col de Portet d'Aspet. His head collided with concrete blocks along the road.
</li><li> On March 12th, 2003, Kazakh cyclist Andrey Kivilev crashed into two other riders during stage 2 of Paris-Nice, fell to the ground without a helmet and hit his head so bad that he could not recover. This death caused UCI to make helmets mandatory for professionals.
</li><li> On June 1, 2008, Mexican cyclist Alejandro Alvarez was killed when a drunk driver plowed into his team during a race on the highway between the towns of Playa Bagdad and Matamoros. The moment of impact <a class="urllink" href="http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2008/06/03/Driver-plows-into-bike-race-in-northern-Mexico-1-killed-2.jpg">was captured on camera<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> by local photographer Jose Fidelino Vera Hernandez
</li><li> On March 27th, 2016, Belgian cyclist Antoine Demoitié crashed during the one day race Gent-Wevelgem, and was subsequently hit by one of the motorcycles that follow the race, leading to fatal injuries.
</li></ul></li><li> On Jan 17, 2015, former Army Ranger turned fitness model and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTuber</a> Greg Plitt was filming a promotional video that had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">attempting to outrun a train</a> when he stumbled while crossing the track and was run down.
</li><li> On July 19, 1982, during the fencing World Championships in Rome, foilist Vladimir Smirnov of the Soviet Union was fencing Matthias Behr of West Germany when Behr's foil snapped and the broken blade penetrated Smirnov's mask and went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">through his eye orbit</a> into his brain. He was kept on life support during the championship but died on July 28.
</li><li> Rodeo meets (especially bull riding) have definitely had their share of deaths in the ring. Most prominent of these is the 1989 death of Lane Frost, who had his ribs broken and pushed into his heart from a collision with the horn from the bull he was riding.
</li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorosYFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorosYFlamenco">toreros</a></em> (bullfighters) <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bullfighters_killed_in_the_arena">have been gored<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the bulls they're supposed to fight. Some of them are: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacio_Sanchez_Mejias">Ignacio Sánchez Mejías<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (whose death was the inspiration for a poem by none other than Federico García Lorca), <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manolete">Manolete<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquirri">Paquirri<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (husband of the singer Isabel Pantoja) and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-prized-matador-ivan-fandino-10644059">Iván Fandiño<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (who actually tripped on his supplies and <em>then</em> got gored).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Theatre </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> British stage magician William Robinson, who performed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yellowface">Yellowface</a> as Chung Ling Soo, died in 1918 when his "bullet catch" trick failed. A poorly-maintained gun fired the actual bullet as well as the harmless blank charge.
</li><li> Part of what made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a> so successful as a stage magician was that he was exceptionally strong and flexible, particularly being famous for being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> punches to the stomach. A visitor at an event once asked him about the rumor, and when told it was true, went to town on him. Problem was, Houdini had been suffering from appendicitis at the time. A common belief around the time was that the punches actually ruptured his appendix because the visitor just started punching with no warning and if he'd had time to prepare and flex his abs he might have survived; it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">now instead believed</a> that the punches didn't actually rupture his appendix, but rather when it ruptured on its own sometime later, Houdini misattributed the pain from that as lingering soreness from the punches, and didn't seek medical treatment because he didn't realize how serious it was. In either case, he collapsed on stage several days later from the peritonitis that led to his death shortly after.
</li><li> Actor Antony Wheeler accidentally hanged himself while performing Judas' climactic suicide scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JesusChristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JesusChristSuperstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></em>.
</li><li> Karl Wallenda, the patriarch of the famous Wallenda family of acrobats, fell to his death while walking on a wire between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978.
<ul><li> Several other Wallendas had died during a performance before Karl's accident. In 1962, a performance of their famed pyramid stunt resulted in an accident that killed three family members and caused life-long injuries to two more. Karl's sister-in-law died from an in-performance fall in Nebraska the next year. Karl's son-in-law died in a rigging-related accident in 1972.
</li><li> Nik Wallenda, Karl's great-grandson, successfully completed the Puerto Rico stunt in 2011. His team has considerable safety practices in place to ensure that what happened to the other Wallendas doesn't happen to him during his death-defying stunts. For instance, he was forced to have a harness attached despite his wishes during his Niagara Falls wire walk stunt precisely to avoid this because it was recorded live and the network didn't want to risk his death airing on live TV if he failed, although he was successful. In his later Grand Canyon crossing, he was allowed to do it sans safety equipment, but the recording had a 10-second delay to give the network time to stop the broadcast if he fell, but again, he was successful.
</li></ul></li><li> There is an apocryphal story of a production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> in which Duncan's murder was shown onstage. The prop daggers the title character used to stab him were somehow replaced with real daggers and the actor playing Duncan was stabbed to death. Whether this is a true story or just used to remind the cast and crew to be careful with stage weapons is difficult to say, but it certainly fits the particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope">superstitions</a> about the play.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader">Uncle John's Bathroom Reader</a></em> book relates the story of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay">Passion Play</a> where Longinus' actor grabbed a real spear instead of a prop spear with a retractable blade, a fact which wasn't discovered until <em>after</em> he stabbed the actor playing Jesus, who shouted "Jesus Christ, I've been stabbed!" and was immediately rushed to the hospital.
</li><li> On June 29, 2013, Sarah Guyard-Guillot, a performer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KA">KA</a></em>, fell to the underbelly of the stage area during the climactic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireFu">Wire Fu</a> sequence. Her injuries proved fatal, making her the first Cirque performer to die from an onstage mishap. A second on-stage death occurred on March 17, 2018, in Tampa, during a performance of the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Volta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Volta">Volta</a></em> when aerialist Yann Arnaud fell headfirst to the stage after losing his grip on an aerial strap and died later that day in the hospital.
</li><li> Wayne Franzen, owner of the Franzen Brothers Circus, <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-05-09/news/9705090201_1_franzen-lucca-circus">was mauled to death<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by one of his own tigers in Carrolltown, PA in 1997 in front of students from six different schools.

He died later in hospital after being declared clinically dead.

</li><li> On November 29, 2016, Olivier Rochette, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> technician and son of company co-founder Gilles Ste-Croix, was fatally struck by a telescoping lift during the pre-set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Luzia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Luzia">Luzia</a></em> in San Francisco, leading to that night's performance being canceled.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder25');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder25" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A number of suicides have been recorded on TV, either set up deliberately (as in the case of Budd Dwyer; see below) or because a news crew happened to be passing at the time. However, the only case of a professional performer doing so seems to have been Christine "Chris" Chubbuck, a talk show host for the Sarasota channel WXLT-TV, who shot herself dead during a live show, <em>Suncoast Digest</em>, on July 15, 1974. She announced her intention on live transmission right before doing it, too; mercifully, nobody seems to have been recording it, and the master tape is now under the possession of her younger brother Greg, who has no intention of releasing it.
</li><li> On January 22, 1987, Pennsylvania state treasurer R. Budd Dwyer called a live press conference the day before his sentencing on bribery charges. After giving a brief speech, he produced a manila envelope, pulled a .357 Magnum revolver out of it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun">shot himself in the mouth</a>. the footage of the actual suicide is on YouTube and is gruesome even for the quality of the video.
<ul><li> A witness against Dwyer later claimed he lied to receive a lighter sentence. Dwyer may have committed suicide so that his family could collect his life insurance and pension (Dwyer's life insurance policy <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.philly.com/1987-05-02/news/26165385_1_state-employees-retirement-board-treasurer-r-budd-dwyer-pension-rights">did not include the usual exclusion for suicide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

They had little warning of what the man was about to do and were unable to cut the live feed in time before he took his life. The anchor, an obviously horrified Shepard Smith, demanded that the recording booth cut the video, but the booth wasn't fast enough. He immediately thereafter apologized for this incident.

Fortunately, he stayed down until the train had completely gone. On another occasion, a crew member put a bottle of acid right beside his drink, and he was almost poisoned when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDrankWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDrankWhat">he drank from it</a> (he had the sense to spit it out right away). And yet another time, when he had his hands bound and was sitting on a horse during the scene where Blondie shoots the rope, the horse got too spooked and ran a mile before anyone could stop it.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a> has broken every bone in his body at least once while doing his own stunts and fight scenes in a thirty-year action movie career filled with some of the most over-the-top action you'll ever see a live actor perform.
<ul><li> He came closest to death while filming a stunt for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmorOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmorOfGod">Armor of God</a></em>. The tree branch he jumped to snapped and he fell fifteen feet. It took eight hours of surgery and a plastic plug to replace the lost skull fragments. Filming stopped for a month to let Jackie recover.
</li><li> A stunt for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour">Rush Hour</a></em> nearly crushed Jackie's skull between a pair of metal boxes. They slammed together about a quarter of a second after Jackie's head was clear. If he were any slower, he'd have been dead.
</li><li> Although it wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> have been fatal, Jackie was nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">castrated</a> on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrunkenMasterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrunkenMasterII">Drunken Master II</a></em> when he did a cartwheel <em>over a spinning sawblade</em> and landed with the spinning saw inches from his nuts.

<ul><li> During the climactic chase scene, Gunnar Hanson slipped on the wet grass and lost his grip on the chainsaw. It flew into the air while still running, and came down blade first just inches from his head.
</li><li> Another incident occurred when his mask slipped during the nighttime chase scene and, because he was blinded, he almost sawed Marilyn Burns in half.
</li><li> And both of those pale in comparison <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19901_5-great-movie-scenes-made-possible-by-reckless-endangerment.html">to something revealed later<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - the climactic dinner scene took so long to film (27 <em>hours straight</em>), in such a stifling atmosphere (110 degrees Fahrenheit <em>outside</em>, as the windows were blockaded), that Gunnar Hansen (who was kitted out in his Leatherface costume, and thus getting hit worst by the heat and mugginess) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqPP4UTwmz8">thought he was meant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <em>actually kill</em> Marilyn Burns in that scene. Edwin Neal, who played the Hitchhiker, had just come back from a tour in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, and described the conditions during the filming of said scene as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">worse</a></em> than anything the Viet Cong had put him through.
</li></ul></li><li> Barely avoided by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt">John Hurt</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan">The Elephant Man</a></em>. The prosthetics he was wearing on his head were very heavy, weighing in at about twenty pounds. When he tried to lie down for a nap for a few hours before going on-set, he practically strangled himself due to the weight of his head on his neck. Hurt was subsequently forced to nap while sitting down. Ironically, the real Joseph Merrick was also forced to sleep while sitting and died because he tried to sleep lying down and ended up strangling himself due to the weight of his head.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep">Meryl Streep</a> was nearly killed while filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiverWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiverWild">The River Wild</a></em>. The director asked her for one more take of a rafting scene, which Meryl said she couldn't handle; the director pressured her, and eventually, Streep agreed. She was swept off the raft and nearly drowned. Once she was out of the water, she confronted her shaking director with, "The next time I say I can't do something, I think we should believe me, don't you?"
</li><li> Infamously, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a></em> the woman with the baby that Yuri pulls onto the train tripped and just barely missed getting her legs mangled under the actual, moving train. (That's the take they use in the movie, incidentally.) There is a long-standing rumor that the woman did get her legs amputated (thanks to miscommunication in the Making-Of Documentary), but this is false.
</li><li> While making an earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a> film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterOToole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterOToole">Peter O'Toole</a> nearly died while filming the Arab attack on Aqaba. A prop gun misfired and panicked O'Toole's camel, throwing him to the ground as hundreds of extras charged past on horses and camels. By O'Toole's account, his camel stood over him, preventing the extras from trampling O'Toole to death. O'Toole tied himself to his camel to avoid repetition on subsequent takes.
</li><li> During the filming of the clown scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist">Poltergeist</a></em>, child actor Oliver Robins really was choking as the clown strangled him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobeHooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobeHooper">Tobe Hooper</a> thought he was acting, but after they saw his face turning purple, Spielberg rushed to his aid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>:

He also nearly drowned in <em>The Two Towers</em> when he was caught in an undertow filming the scene where Aragorn is floating down the river.
</li><li> During filming for Sam's big emotional moment at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin">Sean Astin</a> stepped on a large shard of glass that went right through his foot. Luckily they managed to get him airlifted to get it removed and fixed.

Unfortunately, it began to get out of hand, and the two actors in the scene were only wearing a jelly to protect their skin; the rest of the crew had fire suits. Ten seconds after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> called 'cut' and everyone rushed off, the platform the actors had been standing on collapsed. The heat was so intense (2000 degrees Fahrenheit) one of them passed out afterward.
</li><li> During the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> was nearly trampled by a horse during filming. And while it didn't occur during filming, a crew member named Michael Andrew Bridger died while working in a water tank.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton">Buster Keaton</a> broke his neck during the railroad water-tank scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockJr">Sherlock, Jr.</a></em> when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward.
</li><li> In 1919, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd">Harold Lloyd</a> was posing for photographs with a prop bomb. Unfortunately, the not-prop bomb exploded, blowing off the thumb and first two fingers of his right hand. For the rest of his career, including all of the intricate action sequences that were such a hallmark of his 1920s films, Lloyd performed while wearing a specially-made glove designed to hide his injury.
</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables3">The Expendables 3</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonStatham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonStatham">Jason Statham</a> nearly drowned after the brakes on a truck he was driving gave out and sent him flying off a cliff into the sea, he managed to escape the sinking truck and used his diving skills to swim to the surface.

</li><li> Cruise was almost decapitated while filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai">The Last Samurai</a></em>. He and his co-star Hiroyuki Sanada were acting out a sword fight scene when Sanada swung a sword at Cruise who was on an off-camera mechanical horse at the time. But the machine reportedly malfunctioned and failed to duck at the right moment. Sanada stopped the blade just one inch from his neck.

</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rodan">Rodan</a></em>, Haruo Nakajima fell into the water when the wires attached to his Rodan suit snapped in a flight shot. Thanks to the weight of the costume, he almost drowned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VaranTheUnbelievable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VaranTheUnbelievable">Varan, the Unbelievable</a></em>, a miniature of a truck filled with explosives blew up under Haruo Nakajima while he was playing Varan due to an error in timing the explosions. Fortunately, Nakajima only sustained some burns to his stomach region.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a></em>, as Kong and Godzilla tumble off a cliff and into the sea, Nakajima (in the Godzilla suit) hit his head on the cliff set and fell unconscious. The team was lucky enough to get him out of the water before he drowned.
</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsHedorah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsHedorah">Godzilla vs. Hedorah</a></em>, Kenpachiro Satsuma was diagnosed with appendicitis and required emergency surgery while still wearing the Hedorah suit since it was so difficult to remove. During the operation, Satsuma learned that painkillers have no effect on him.
</li><li> While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsDestoroyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsDestoroyah">Godzilla vs. Destoroyah</a></em>, Kenpachiro Satsuma frequently inhaled carbon monoxide given off by the smoke effects of the Burning Godzilla suit, causing him to pass out several times and almost die.

Fisher had become stuck and tried to alert the crew by banging on the window she was facing, but the cast and crew did not think anything of it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">that was what the character was supposed to be doing</a>. She was able to untangle the chain thanks to a nearby stunt person and get out of the tank safely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> suffered a broken leg in a potentially fatal accident during the studio filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, when a real hydraulic door on the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> interior set was closed while he was walking through it. The production company involved pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to the accident and were heavily fined.
</li><li> In the classic gangster films, real bullets were used. For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteHeat">White Heat</a></em>, the producers employed skilled marksmen who used low-velocity bullets to break windows or show bullets hitting near the characters. In the factory scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCagney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCagney">James Cagney</a> was missed by mere inches.

Some of his hair was singed, and he was blasted forward. The shot in the film is his real reaction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a> credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithDavid">Keith David</a> for saving his life while making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon">Platoon</a></em>. While shooting in an open-doored Huey gunship, the helicopter banked too hard and Sheen was thrown towards - and would have gone through - the open door. David grabbed him by the back and pulled him back in.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecGuinness">Alec Guinness</a> experienced this shooting several of his Ealing comedies.

<ul><li> During the chase through the pipe, someone thought that the mattress was going too slow, so they loosened one of the wires that was pulling them. When the crew came back from lunch, nobody checked the rig. They then shot the scene where Mario and the Brooklyn Babes flew out of the tunnel, only to find they were going way too fast and out of control. One of the Babes almost fell off the mattress twenty-five feet onto solid concrete. They all stayed on, but when it hit the ground, it flipped over and they all smashed their heads. Aside from a few bruises, they were okay.

If Grenville hadn't broken character and yelled at Tom to jump until he did, he would have been seriously injured - the fire brigade had to be called in between takes. If you watch the sequence, you'll notice later shots of the pyre are a <em>lot</em> less fiery than the early long shot of the Doctor, especially shots with the Doctor in.

Robert Reed thought that the camera looked unsafe and made them do a test run first. When they did, the camera flew off and would have killed the actors if they had been on the ride.

Nevertheless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">most of the cast considered the episode to be their favorite</a>.
</li><li> An infamous 2006 Vampire Dragster crash very nearly killed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> presenter Richard Hammond. In a slight subversion, however, he had already done the required take successfully. It was revealed when they were watching the footage when he returned to the show that he was trying to set an official speed record (which requires running the vehicle in two opposing directions to get the average speed of each run), during which he crashed at 300mph. Had he been taller, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">something which he gets mocked for frequently on the show</a>, he would have been decapitated. More unsettlingly, the producers had originally planned to have James "Captain Slow" May do the bit with the Vampire Dragster, which almost certainly <em>would</em> have ended in tragedy, as May is taller than Hammond by a fair bit.
</li><li> Apparently one brush with death wasn't enough since Hammond also had to spectacularly crash in <em>Top Gear</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrandTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGrandTour">The Grand Tour</a></em>. Hammond was completing a Swiss hill climb event in an electric Rimac Concept One. He lost control of the car just after the finish line, broke through a barrier, and plunged down the mountainside, barely missing a house on the way. When he landed at the bottom, the car started burning; luckily, Hammond stayed conscious and managed to free himself from his seat belt and drag himself out before the car became engulfed in flames. His worst injury was needing a knee replacement.

Unfortunately, the weights made Danny unable to reach the surface for air. He was thankfully rescued by emergency divers before he could drown.

It landed in the exact spot where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronPaul">Aaron Paul</a> (who plays Jesse Pinkman) had been standing just a second before after he picked the luckiest moment possible to ask the director if he could try saying his lines from another spot.
</li><li> Diminutive British comic performer Charlie Drake ended one live half-hour show by being pulled through through a balsa wood bookcase. The panels were held together with light glue so that they would give way on impact. Unfortunately, a stagehand, not realizing that the bookcase was meant for a stunt, thought the panels looked too flimsy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">and nailed them in place</a>. As a result, instead of springing to his feet offstage and returning to deliver his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>, Drake was knocked unconscious, and his fellow performers could be seen looking worried as the credits rolled. He ended up taking a two-year break from television <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">but came back in 1963 with a new series</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinChenoweth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinChenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a> was struck in the face by a falling light fixture on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em>, and suffered a concussion, skull fracture, broken nose, and neck injuries. If it had fallen directly on top of her head, she would have been killed or rendered vegetative.
</li><li> An example of this was talked about on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest">World's Dumbest...</a></em> A senior citizen production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen">Of Mice &amp; Men</a></em> had a dress rehearsal going smoothly. Then it came time for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">George to shoot Lenny in the head.</a> Problem was that they were using a real gun as a prop and the man playing George forgot to check if it was empty. It wasn't and when he pulled the trigger it went off, ricocheting off the man's skull and taking off a piece of his ear. The actor play George even admitted that he should have checked the gun to make sure. The man playing Lenny was not upset as it was an accident and planned to return to the troupe once he recovered. This also serves as a reminder of gun safety. All guns are loaded at all times and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">do not point them at anything you do not wish to destroy or kill</a>.

At one point Colin finds an odd device with a crank, has Ryan put one end in his mouth, and is about to start cranking when host Drew Carey visibly panics and stops them, saying the item is supposed to make fire. Colin points it away from them, giving it a few cranks. When nothing happens, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sroytvPU3UI">he shrugs and jokingly attempts to return it to Ryan's mouth.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Ryan:</strong> Someone wants their own show!
</div><ul><li> Specifically, Drew thought it was a starter for a barbecue grill. What it actually is is a device for blowing air on the hot coals to get the fire going faster. Even if it had been something that produces fire, it is highly likely it would have been disabled anyway, given Colin and Ryan's tendency to put props in their mouths.
</li></ul></li><li> Bobby Davro was placed in a pillory by his guests in the last episode of his series <em>Public Enemy Number One</em>. The pillory fell over, and Davro fell face-first into the studio's concrete floor. A slightly-raised portion of the stage gave him space to avoid a potentially fatal head injury.

Fortunately, Autry flew a doctor into the remote area, who saved Buttram's life before the ambulance arrived.

Auto racing is a dangerous sport, and there have been a great many near misses in motorsports history.
<ul><li> As dramatised in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rush2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rush2013">Rush (2013)</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda">Niki Lauda</a> was in the brink of death when his Ferrari collided with an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with Brett Lunger's Surtees-Ford car. His face got nearly burned to a crisp, and the toxic fumes emanating from the wreckage damaged his lungs and blood. The injuries Niki endured were so serious that the doctors initially thought he was a lost cause and called a priest to administer the last rites to him; Lauda somehow lived to tell the tale and was able to finish <em>fourth place</em> in the Italian GP no more than a month after the incident that nearly killed him. (He ultimately passed away in 2019.)
</li><li> During practice for the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez, Lotus driver Martin Donnelly suffered a massive accident in which his seat was torn from the cockpit and thrown clear of the debris. He suffered brain and lung contusions, and leg fractures so severe that his right leg nearly had to be severed. The injuries ended his Formula One career, but he made a full recovery and went on to race in smaller sports car events instead.
</li><li> Four race drivers are known to have survived basilar skull fractures, the same injury that killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> icon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DaleEarnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> in 2001:
<ul><li> In 1989, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver Philippe Streiff suffered the injury in a testing crash. He has been confined to a wheelchair ever since, however.
</li><li> in 1993, NASCAR driver Stanley Smith nearly died from one after slamming headlong into the outside wall in an incident much more famous for sending fellow driver Jimmy Horton over said wall and onto an access road at Talladega. He did end up retiring from racing for years afterward, however.
</li><li> In 1994, NASCAR driver Ernie Irvan suffered the same injury in a practice crash at Michigan International Speedway. He was given only a 10% chance of surviving the night, but made a full recovery, returning to racing about a year later.
</li><li> NASCAR Truck racer Rick Carelli suffered one, as well as damage to his carotid artery and sinus, in 1999 at Richmond when the front left tire on his truck blew, shunting him into the outside wall hard. Amazingly he was able to return to racing the very next year, albeit in a poorly funded team that he had to double as crew chief for.
</li></ul></li><li> On July 25, 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver Felipe Massa was hit in the face with a 700-800 gram spring while traveling at high speed during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. His injuries were life-threatening, but he made a full recovery and returned to racing the next season.
</li><li> Similarly, fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver Robert Kubica had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/15853406">a rally accident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the beginning of the 2012 season due to in which he got <em>impaled by a crash barrier</em>, which caused him multiple fractures on the right side of his body. This not only forced him out of Formula One but it also permanently damaged his right arm, an injury that is still noticeable to this day.
<ul><li> Remarkably, Kubica returned to racing in late 2012, first competed in rallying before beginning to campaign a possible return to Formula One in 2017 despite his right arm being much weaker than normal due to the injury. And against all odds, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46300009">Kubica<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/140248/williams-announces-kubica-2019-f1-comeback">did<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.kubica-to-make-fairy-tale-f1-racing-return-with-williams-in-2019.6zTE6l2mVGA6OiG60MoY2W.html">return<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Formula One in 2019 - he was a shadow of his former self, but it's incredible that he was able to compete <em>at all</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Not the first time for Kubica. During the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix he survived an accident eerily similar to that of Ayrton Senna; same sweeping left-hand bend, same speed, and same concrete barrier but with less run-off area. Though he was knocked unconscious, it is a testament to the safety of current Formula 1 cars that Kubica suffered no lasting injuries and was in fact medically cleared to participate in the very next race at Indianapolis (though his team refused to enter him just to be on the safe side).
</li><li> CART and F1 driver Alex Zanardi lost his legs and nearly 3/4 of his blood volume in a 2001 crash at Eurospeedway Lausitz. He later returned to touring car racing, and still later took up handcycling, winning two gold medals at both the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics, even winning one of his four golds at the Brands Hatch Circuit in Kent.
</li><li> During the 1966 Formula 1 race at Spa-Francorchamps, Jackie Stewart's car ran off the road, hit a tree and a shed, before coming to rest upside-down. He spent 25 minutes trapped there with fuel leaking all over him since there were no track marshals nearby to help extract him or put out his car if it caught fire. Eventually, with the help of other racers and using a spectator's toolkit, he was freed and put in the back of a truck. Eventually, he was taken to the infield medical center where he spent a few hours on a stretcher not receiving medical help, before being transported to a hospital (oh, and the ambulance got lost on the way to the hospital). This comedy of errors is what prompted the Scotsman to become such a major safety advocate.
</li><li> In the 1994 German Grand Prix, Benetton driver Jos Verstappen was horrifyingly set alight along with his car on live TV due to a refueling accident in the pits. Fortunately, his racing suit successfully protected him and he suffered only a minor burn to his nose.
</li><li> During the season-ending 1995 Australian Grand Prix, Mika Hakkinen was catapulted into the wall at 120mph after a tyre failure, resulting in severe injuries including a fractured skull and a blocked airway. His life was saved by an emergency tracheotomy, and not only did he recover in time to take part in the 1996 season, he went on to become a two-time world champion and the greatest rival to Michael Schumacher during his period of dominance.
</li><li> In 2007, funny car legend John Force blew a tire right after finishing a run, causing it to swing left into Kenny Bernstein and split in half. The front half, with the engine, slid all the way to the dirt overdrive area, while the rear half, with John, went headfirst into the wall, badly injuring him.
</li><li> During the 2014 24 Hours of Daytona, Memo Gidley, driving a Chevrolet Prototype, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKZE7YAeh4">slammed into the back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the stalled and nearly stopped Ferrari of Matteo Malucelli at 120 MPH, utterly destroying both cars and breaking Gidley's left arm, left leg, and back (Malucelli got away with a concussion). Considering how little of the prototype was left after the wreck, it's pretty amazing that that's all he suffered.
</li><li> In 2000, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> driver Sam Schmidt was testing for the new season at Walt Disney World Speedway in Florida, when he lost control and smashed into the outside wall. He was rendered permanently paralyzed from the neck down and spent five months on a respirator, but, after recovering sufficiently, ultimately came back to the series as a team owner.
</li><li> While practicing for the 2015 Indianapolis 500, James Hinchcliffe's right-front suspension failed, causing him to slam into the wall at 220 MPH. The impact with the wall forced the right front wishbone through the monocoque and both of his legs, causing major blood loss. He was rushed to the hospital for surgery on the legs. <a class="urllink" href="http://fox59.com/2016/03/17/indycar-driver-james-hinchcliffe-talks-about-his-recovery/">In a 2016 interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he talked about his recovery, saying just how close he came to dying. He said that the body can lose about 60% of its blood before there's no coming back, and he had lost just over 50% when he arrived in surgery; any later and he probably would have died. He also said that if the suspension piece had gone through his legs a half-inch to the left, it would have severed his femoral artery, which would have also killed him.
</li><li> The 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans had a number of major crashes, of which Allan McNish's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZJPir6NaHY">massive crash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is probably the best remembered one. All that was left of his car was the cockpit crash pod, which thankfully had done its job and allowed McNish to walk away from the accident without a scratch. 2011 was also the first year that the organizers had mandated 'fins' on the prototypes, and it's widely believed that without the fin keeping the car stable and level, the crash could have been much worse. 2011 was <em>also</em> the first year that Audi used a closed-cockpit car...
</li><li> Coming to the checkered flag of the 2013 Drive4COPD 300 (the NASCAR Nationwide Series, now Xfinity Series, race run the day before the Daytona 500), Regan Smith was spun by Brad Keselowski while the latter was pushing the former. This started a chain reaction that saw rookie Kyle Larson fly nose-first into the catch fence in the tri-oval, ripping the engine from the car and sending debris and the front tires flying into the grandstands. 33 spectators were injured, one critically, but thankfully, nobody died (though there were rumors on social media that someone had died). Larson was uninjured and walked away from the car. Tony Stewart, who had been passed by multiple cars with two laps to go, cut through the grass (going below the yellow line to avoid a wreck is legal) to win the race, tying the late Dale Earnhardt for total Daytona wins; it was ultimately his final Nationwide Series win prior to retiring in 2016. However, due to the crash, Stewart did not celebrate in victory lane. After the wreck, pushing was banned in all three national series, bringing an end to the much-maligned two-car tandem that had dominated the Nationwide Series since the 2011 introduction of the new cars (the practice was forcibly ended the year before in the Sprint Cup Series by way of a new superspeedway aero package aimed at returning to classic pack racing).
</li><li> Right at the end of the 2015 Coke Zero 400 in Daytona, moments before Dale Earnhardt, Jr. crossed the line to win the race, a chain reaction crash happened behind him after Denny Hamlin accidentally tapped the rear-end of Kevin Harvick's #4 Chevrolet. Austin Dillon, who was right behind Hamlin, hit Hamlin's car at such an angle that it flipped over and flew roof-first into <em>the catch fence</em>. The force of the impact with the catch fence was so immense, it tore the engine away from the car and pretty much brought the car to a near-full stop. The car then landed upside-down and slowly spun to the exit of the pit-road when Brad Keselowski's #2 Ford impacted his car after Brad spun out due to oil spilled from the crash. Amazingly, Dillon walked out unharmed, although 5 fans were injured from debris flying from Dillon's catch fence impact.
</li><li> During the third stage of the 2017 Dakar Rally, Slovakian rider Ivan Jakes <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dakar-rally-hit-lightning-strike-motorcyclist-ivan-jakes-salta-argentina-south-america-motorbike-a7511071.html">was struck by lightning<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mid-stage. Amazingly, not only did he escape with minor injuries, he actually finished said stage in 15th place!
</li><li> During the 2017 Indianapolis 500, Scott Dixon hit the stricken car of Jay Howard, who had bounced off the wall, which caused Dixon to fly through the air, and land on the SAFER barrier on the inside wall rear-first, where his car did a barrel roll, tearing apart its back end. After watching the replay, the announcers even said the car saved his life (in fact, he was even able to walk away, though due to a minor ankle injury, he was on crutches for a few days afterward). Also, if he had landed differently, say front end on the wall, instead of rear-end, he could easily have been killed.
</li><li> In the 2018 IndyCar Pocono 500, Ryan Hunter-Reay nearly ended up with a literal faceful of car in an incident with Robert Wickens, where the former was accidentally spun out by the latter, who then climbed over his car into the catch fence, followed by Wickens' car smacking Hunter-Reay's roll bar mere inches above his head, breaking it. He came out of it unscathed, however. Wickens didn't, breaking both ankles, his right arm, one vertebra, and suffering a pulmonary contusion. This <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/wickens-crash-hunter-reay-head-protection-1.4796713">further renewed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> calls for further head protection in open-wheel cars, either in the form of a windscreen, a Formula One-style halo, or a fighter jet-style closed cockpit. Starting in 2020, IndyCar will introduce an aeroscreen, and has also dropped Pocono from the schedule due to them finally realizing the track was too dangerous for high-speed open-wheeled cars, and consequently replaced it with Richmond, a short track that hasn't been run by the series since 2009.
</li><li> In the inaugural Rally Chile, Thierry Neuville misjudged a fast crest which saw his Hyundai <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUFX3dLDcv0">tumbling a dozen times<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, necessitating a trip to the hospital for Neuville and co-driver Nicolas Gilsoul, who fortunately came out practically unscathed save for some minor injuries, given how mangled the car ended up.
</li><li> Coming to the checkered flag for the 2020 Daytona 500, Ryan Newman was knocked into the outside wall by Ryan Blaney, who was attempting to bump draft him, which caused his car to roll onto its roof. He was subsequently struck on the driver's side roof by Corey LaJoie, which crushed the roof in. It took fifteen minutes to extract Newman, who suffered severe but not life-threatening head injuries (sheets had been erected while he was transferred to the ambulance, and before an official announcement was made, social media was flooded with rumors that Newman had died or was awake and talking; the moderators of NASCAR's Reddit page did a sterling job clamping down on these rumors); he was released two days later, but has been replaced for the time being by Ross Chastain. Many commentators mentioned that he had worked with NASCAR to strengthen the roofs of the cars after his flips in 2003 (which famously ripped out his back suspension) and 2009, which may have saved his life.
</li><li> The 1981 Indianapolis 500 is infamous for a number of things, including two nearly fatal incidents:
<ul><li> Rick Mears' car caught fire with him in it due to a fuelling problem, causing him and several members of his pit crew to be set alight with invisible methanol flames. One pit crew member tried to pull Mears' helmet off his head while he was still burning and unable to breathe, which would probably have fanned the flames into his face, before his dad grabbed a fire extinguisher and put him out. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.
</li><li> Minutes after Mears' frightening fire, Danny Ongais, trying to recover from a disastrous pit stop, overcooked it going into turn 3 while trying to pass a slower car, resulting in an utterly terrifying wreck where he slammed the wall nearly head on, knocking him unconscious, and badly breaking his feet. The fatal crash of Gordon Smiley in the same corner the year after, where he crashed in almost the same way, except directly head on, showed just how lucky Ongais was.
</li></ul></li><li> The first race of the 2020 Indycar Iowa double header proved to be the first test of the new aeroscreen package they had implemented to protect drivers' heads. Coming to a restart, Colton Herta started accelerating, and continued to do so after the restart was waved off. He <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT8awnEalQ0">rear-ended Rinus Veekay,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and his car climbed over Veekay's, impacting the aeroscreen, and deflecting him over the other driver's head. Without the windscreen, Herta's tire probably would have hit Veekay's head, with potentially fatal results.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder32');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder32" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> During a concert stunt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> almost hanged himself while dangling by an onstage noose. He survived when a roadie cut him down. He also was nearly strangled by his pet snake which he wore around his neck, but that was during a practice (the snake's head had to be cut off to save him).
<ul><li> Dannii Minogue also had a similar snake-related incident.
</li></ul></li><li> Barely averted by James Hetfield of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> who accidentally walked into a column of phosphorous flame that nearly killed him during a 1992 concert in Montreal. Hetfield suffered significant burns to his left arm, but he was back on stage under a month later. Unable to play guitar, he just sang for several concerts while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalChurch">Metal Church</a>'s John Marshall filled in for him on guitar. Later tours included a stuntman on fire as a homage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi">Yoshiki</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan">X Japan</a> suffered a broken neck onstage in 1995 during the first run of the <em>Dahlia</em> tour. He was both lucky and unlucky - lucky in that the place where the break occurred did not cause paralysis or death, especially when he was carried offstage improperly by road crew with no neck stabilization at all, unlucky in that how the break healed gave him permanent neck injuries including weakening of the bones in his neck, two split discs in his cervical spine, and further damage which was only aggravated worse when he returned to drumming with the band full time in 2008 - collapsing for real onstage from the pain in a 2008 show and having to have emergency surgery on his neck in 2009. The emergency surgery accidentally stumbled upon a thyroid cancer, which was also treated. So in a way, his near-miss likely saved his life from cancer 14 years later.
</li><li> A near-fatal incident happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HidetoMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HidetoMatsumoto">hide</a> during a solo performance when he had a pyrotechnics accident onstage due to being drunk. Since being drunk later contributed to his far more private death, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>'s Ol' Dirty Bastard nearly had a pyrotechnic-related accident near the end of his performance at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees">Fugees</a> member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Garfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Garfunkel">Pras</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFLOgKHc2Qo">yanked him out of harm's way<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the last minute.
</li><li> Another musician who evaded death onstage was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a>, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">Rolling Stones</a> concert in Sacramento, California, in September 1965. Before performing the song "The Last Time", Richards noted his microphone was pointing away from him. To put it in the right direction, he smashed his guitar against the mic, causing it to give him an electric shock, which rendered him unconscious for seven minutes. Luckily Bill Wyman rushed to his aid in time to get the guitar away from his body (the shock had <em>melted away</em> three of its strings).
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld">"This may be the reason why Keith cannot be killed by conventional weapons."</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> was assaulted by a drugged-up audience member during a performance at the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969; the would-be murderer was fatally stabbed by event security before he had a chance to do anything except point a gun at the stage.
</li><li> In December 1981, the Stones were in the middle of "Satisfaction" when Keith spotted a lone fan climbing on stage and making a dash for Mick. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s murder still on everyone's mind, Keith calmly turned down the volume on his guitar, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv1bM0pp_o4">hit the guy over the head with it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, strapped his guitar back on, turned up the volume and kept playing without missing a beat. Then he went down to the police station and bailed the guy out.
</li></ul></li><li> Ace Frehley of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> suffered an electric shock on-stage when his guitar's amp malfunctioned. After recovering, he took advantage of the experience to write the song "Shock Me".
</li><li> When shooting the cover art for her 1975 album <em>Adventures in Paradise</em>, singer <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinnieRiperton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinnieRiperton">Minnie Riperton</a> was attacked by a lion. The trainer was on hand to quickly subdue the animal before anyone could suffer any injury, though. The incident was filmed and appeared when she visited talk shows to promote the album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a> has had heart problems most of his life, by his own admission. During one concert he had a heart attack on stage. It took several minutes before the crowd and the rest of the band realized that he was not, in fact, getting really into the act.
</li><li> Black Metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> ran into this in their early years. Lead singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Dead</a> would make it a point to slash himself up onstage. Many times he would actually attempt suicide onstage, only to be hospitalized for blood loss. Guitarist Euronymous would try to pass these suicide attempts off as an accident during Dead's artistic self-mutilation. He even joked that "If that idiot hits another artery, we'll have to delay the next album again". Of course, Euronymous knew that Dead was suicidal, and purposely blocked him from receiving treatment so that his self-destructive behavior would establish the band's shocking reputation.
</li><li> In the summer of 2011, there were three highly publicized stage collapses at open-air festivals which nearly cost the lives of the artist performing at the time and, in some cases, killed or injured fans in the first few rows:
<ul><li> On July 17, the stage at Bluesfest in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada collapsed 20 minutes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a>'s set. The stage collapsed away from the audience and the band was able to escape in time, but the band's equipment truck and some of their instruments were destroyed.
</li><li> On August 13, the stage at the Indiana State Fair collapsed just as country music duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugarland">Sugarland</a> were taking the stage. The resulting collapse killed 7 people and injured 43. Sugarland, their management, and the state of Indiana have been named as the defendant in several lawsuits by the survivors of the collapse.
</li><li> On August 19, one of the stages at the popular Belgian festival Pukkelpop collapsed during the performance of American indie rock band The Smith Westerns during a severe storm. Once again, the band members were able to escape the stage with seconds to spare, but unfortunately, the stage and several other tents collapsed into the audience and killed five people and injured 140. The rest of the festival, which was to include performances by big-name acts which rarely perform in Belgium, was canceled.

Mid-air he realized he was still holding his mic, and tossed it away just in time before he could electrocute himself.
</li><li> While performing live during MTV's Spring Break, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> lead singer Thom Yorke jumped into the nearby swimming pool and quickly began drowning. Because the band was still playing their instruments nobody realized Yorke's life was in danger and he frantically swam to the nearby ledge. In another twist a <em>live microphone</em> had been left at the poolside, and an MTV VJ realized it was there. Yorke almost touched the live microphone before the VJ smacked it out of his reach and pulled him from the pool.
</li><li> During a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> concert in Berlin, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers was walking across the stage when lead singer Till Lindemann suddenly rushed forward and pulled him back - barely a split second later, a massive column of fire (one of the many pyrotechnic effects used by the band in their live shows) erupted from the stage. Had Lindemann not pulled him back, Landers would have been severely injured, and probably killed outright.

That something was him breathing in a ton of fire, permanently scarring his throat and vocal cords. Considering some of the breathing problems seen on stage since then, it may have damaged his lungs too. This may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, as he had fired drummer Sara Lee Lucas with, well, fire, on stage, in Las Vegas, back in 1995, to replace him with Ginger Fish.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> narrowly avoided this <em>twice</em> within fifteen years, but both accidents would permanently affect his career and health:
<ul><li> In 1984, Jackson's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rpn9gGZiLo">hair caught fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as he was filming a commercial for Pepsi. He suffered second-degree burns to his scalp and he had to undergo treatment for his injuries; the general consensus is that this was the beginning of the prescription drug dependency problems that ultimately cost him his life in 2009. His hair also never grew back where the burns reached his scalp. He wore wigs every day for the rest of his life.
</li><li> In 1999, during a charity concert in Munich, Jackson was performing "Earth Song" on a suspended bridge over the stage. The stage split apart as part of the routine, and the portion Jackson was standing on was raised up high above the stage. However, the wires holding the bridge piece gave out, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPIFLhR-BGA">Jackson plummeted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>fifty feet</em> to the ground, holding on for dear life. Jackson severely messed up his back from the fall, which would end up hamstringing his dancing for the rest of his life, and worsened his already severe Demerol addiction.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Emmure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Emmure">Emmure</a> singer Frankie Palmeri <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4T3Yubs3F4">nearly died of electrocution while on stage in Moscow.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-J8lW8-SDQ">Emmure elaborates on what happened here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> At a 2009 concert in Alberta, a wind storm caused a stage collapse that gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington">Billy Currington</a> a concussion, injured his bass player, and killed one spectator.
</li><li> Rumors say that this <em>almost</em> happened to Simon LeBon from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">Duran Duran</a> in the filming of the video for "Wild Boys". LeBon was strapped to the spinning windmill which dunked his head beneath the water with each revolution; he supposedly found himself in real difficulty when the windmill once stopped with his head underwater and he almost drowned as a result, but he has always denied it.
</li><li> Mikey Way said that this nearly happened during the making of the music video for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a>'s "The Ghost of You". The landing craft that the band was on had capsized when the trapdoors opened due to the amount of weight it was carrying (aside from five members of the band, there were the extras, as well as the military equipment they were carrying), and they almost drowned.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> drummer Bill Berry suffered a near-fatal brain aneurysm during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland in March 1995. The band canceled the remaining tour dates as Berry was hospitalized, but though he eventually made a full recovery and resumed the tour with his bandmates (and went on to release one more album with them in 1996), the on-stage aneurysm is said to have been one of the factors in his decision to leave the band in 1997.
</li><li> Operatic baritone Kimm Julian was accidentally stabbed in the stomach by his co-star, tenor David Rendall, during a rehearsal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></em> at the Milwaukee-based Florentine Opera when the switchblade-style knife used by the company failed to retract. Fortunately, Julian survived and Rendall was cleared of any wrongdoing.
</li><li> Danny Peppermint, who had a minor hit with "The Peppermint Twist" (not to be confused with the better-known Joey Dee song), suffered an electric shock from a microphone while onstage at the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas on January 24, 1962. He was rushed to the hospital and survived, but his career didn't due to the loss of momentum: "Peppermint Twist" stalled at #54 and his other releases (two singles and an album) failed to chart.
</li><li> Paul van Dyk fell 10 meters through a covered up gap on stage during his performance at A State of Trance festival on February 28th, 2016. He suffered spinal and severe brain injury but was able to recover after 3 months.
</li><li> Greg Page, one of the founding members of the children's music group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a>, had to retire in 2006 because of his failing health. In January 2020, during a reunion benefit concert to raise funds for bushfire victims, Page suffered a cardiac arrest just off-stage and had to be resuscitated. He survived but missed the second scheduled show the following night.
</li><li> On November 13, 2015, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal">Eagles of Death Metal</a> concert at Le Bataclan Theatre in Paris was attacked by ISIS suicide bombers, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty">the deaths of 90 audience members</a>; luckily, all of the band members survived unscathed.

New Jack accidentally cut him too deeply and he nearly bled out, which resulted in a lawsuit and potential criminal charges against New Jack and ECW (which were all dropped).
</li><li> Owen Hart infamously crushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>'s neck with a piledriver during a match at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a></em> 1997, which left Austin briefly paralyzed in the ring (which Owen interpreted as having killed Austin at first). This incident forced Austin to change his style for the rest of his career (having been a fairly technical and mat-oriented wrestler prior to a brawler later on) and left him with several lingering neck and knee pains that ultimately forced his retirement in 2003.
</li><li> The legendary Hell in a Cell match at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KingOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KingOfTheRing">King of the Ring</a> 1998</em> between The Undertaker and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> had two well-known spots: Mankind plummeting sixteen feet through an announcer's table, and being slammed through the mesh ceiling into the ring. The former was entirely scripted but the latter was accidental, which The Undertaker thought had surely broken Mankind's neck upon impact. Thankfully he was mostly okay (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> made Foley promise that he'd never attempt something so crazy for the rest of his career), although about as banged up as one might expect.
</li><li> The 2004 installment of WWE <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JudgmentDay">Judgment Day</a></em> included a match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a> in which Eddie executed a bad blade job and ended up severing an artery in his head. The resulting crimson <em>fountain</em> was so horrific that Eddie went into shock backstage from blood loss after the match. The PPV is the only event in WWE's history that has ever been rated TV-MA, specifically because of this incident.
</li><li> This is unfortunately common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler">hardcore wrestling</a> promotions, for example the aforementioned Mass Transit incident.

As with the Clint Malarchuk incident, after McCleary stumbled to the bench and into the dressing room, a quick-acting medical team saved his life.
</li></ul></li><li> The UK Premier League football player Fabrice Muamba suffered a near-fatal heart attack on the pitch in March 2012, while playing for Bolton Wanderers away against Spurs. He survived despite having had no spontaneous heartbeat for over an hour but unfortunately had to retire from the sport. He might very well have died had a cardiac-specialist doctor not been among Spurs' fans that day, who immediately realized what was happening and rushed straight onto the pitch to save him.
</li><li> Buffalo Bills' tight end Kevin Everett suffered a severe neck injury on what looked to be a routine play during the 2007 season opener. Doctors performed a relatively new procedure on him, right on the field, rapidly cooling the injured area to prevent swelling from causing additional damage. Without the treatment, he likely would have died on the field. The treatment was developed by a charity that the Bills' owner Ralph Wilson continued to support with his own money even after the remaining NFL owners had pulled out and directed their money elsewhere. To make the story even weirder, this injury and the Malarchuk and Zednik incidents listed above all occurred in Buffalo.
</li><li> On December 13, 1933, Eddie Shore of the Boston Bruins checked Toronto Maple Leafs right winger Ace Bailey from behind. Bailey fractured his skull when he hit the ice. Although Bailey survived, his career didn't.

</li><li> On November 1, 2015, Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette collapsed after a blindside block by Dallas Cowboys safety Jeff Heath. Despite damage to his vertebrae, medical personnel properly stabilized his head and neck, and he survived. Lockette made a full recovery after surgery but retired the next offseason. According to the doctors who treated him, had one of his teammates so much as touched him to see if he was alright after the injury, it would have likely been enough to kill him.
</li><li> On April 20, 2018, Chicago White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar suffered a brain hemorrhage after pitching in the 6th inning of a game against the Houston Astros. The training staff gave prompt medical attention to Farquhar after he collapsed in the dugout, which very likely saved his life.

The Lions won 13-10, but the game was overshadowed when Lions linebacker Reggie Brown suffered a spinal cord injury while making a tackle, slipping briefly into unconsciousness and nearly dying on the field before being revived. Brown would be diagnosed with a spinal cord contusion, and while his football career was over, he would retain the ability to walk.

While he survived, the Siegfried &amp; Roy stage show in Vegas was canceled immediately after. The duo retired from performing after that, and the tiger was also saved from death because Horn begged the authorities to not harm the animal. While the use of wild animals in stage shows had already been growing unpopular since the '90s due to the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> and protests by animal rights groups, this incident marked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">the turning point</a> at which it fell out of favor.

The cuts were deep enough to expose cartilage and trachea but luckily didn't sever major arteries. The show wasn't interrupted; the injured students stayed on stage until the "dead bodies" were removed as usual for that show, and the audience didn't learn until later that the supposed fake blood was real. There had been injuries during rehearsals but they weren't deemed to be serious enough to change that aspect of the production.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> episode "Abracadaver", a magician named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Al Lusion</a> was disrupted during his act by a little girl who accidentally caused him to fall into an iron maiden. Al comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> as a zombie to exact his revenge and selects out Blossom, whom the little girl bore an uncanny resemblance.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode "Sing a Song of Patrick", a radio studio promised to record a song in a newspaper ad. Patrick sent them "I Wrote This", an <em>atrociously</em> bad meandering pile of nonsense that is barely a song at best. So bad, it <em>killed</em> the band at the radio studio to produce a record.
<ul><li> In an earlier episode, "Band Geeks," the two flag twirlers in Squidward's marching band apparently die during rehearsal when their twirling sends them airborne like helicopters and they crash into a blimp, causing a massive explosion.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> episode "Friendenemies", Marco mentions being a fan of an action star named Mackie Hand, who got killed performing a stunt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tom eventually brings him back to life.</span>
</li><li> Subverted in the penultimate episode of the fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a>.</em> BoJack and his co-star/girlfriend Gina are filming a scene from his detective show <em>Philbert</em> where Gina's character confronts Philbert (played by BoJack) about having been the murderer all along, causing Philbert to lash out and choke Gina's character. However, due to BoJack's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> from his painkiller addiction and his anger against Gina for confronting him on that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he keeps choking her after the director yells cut, without even realizing he's doing it.</span> It's highly implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">BoJack</span> would have killed Gina if Mr. Peanutbutter had not pulled him off of her. This is the incident that pushes BoJack to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">go into rehab.</span>
