</p><p>It's worth noting that the creation of a story, especially those of works of fiction, may entice readers into receiving the message in an interesting manner but in fact, it neither adds nor subtracts evidence from a point of view. It may display evidence, it may make an argument using that evidence, it may convince the reader using that evidence. Authors should remember this, though: <em>a work of fiction doesn't prove anything.</em> The fact that the author expects to take their fictional world as instantly applicable to real life is part of what makes this trope so grating, but whether or not any specific reader considers an Author Filibuster a good or bad thing is usually dependent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias">whether or not the reader agrees</a> with the content of the filibuster.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">infamous</a> final two episodes are essentially an Author Filibuster on the human condition and the nature of loneliness.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <em>End of Evangelion</em> was the same, just not taking place on a "big blue ball", and was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">even more confusing</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In an early chapter of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> manga, Il Palazzo takes a few pages to rant about how he feels Christianity has had a negative influence on the world. The anime parodies this by Excel suggesting they skip that scene to avoid controversy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">A lampshade is hung</a> by Excel in the manga: "I think we may have just offended a large portion of the world's population..."
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> manga had an ending consisting of little more than the author's existential musings thinly packaged in abstract screen toned "art". However, this philosophical payload was cleverly hidden inside an espionage series, and anyone who didn't see where it was going after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kusanagi beheld the falling feather</span> have only themselves to blame.
</li><li> This is a common feature in all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune">Shirow Masamune</a>'s manga. He is famous for including extensive commentaries at the end of volumes, the 30-page commentary in <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> being the most famous example. He will also often break the fourth wall by adding his own personal comments in the margins, ranging from the technical aspects of gadgets included in the story to subjects like the nature of human souls and the organization of Japan's military. These commentaries will often only have a loose connection to what actually goes on in the story. <em>Ghost in the Shell II</em> is probably the best example, as ~1/4th of all pages have some sort of commentary in the margins.
</li><li> A chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em> includes a several-page-long speech about how great the environment is, how everybody should do their part to protect it, and how pollution and industrial emissions are evil. It is then shortly followed by the introduction of a new character whose entire goal is to spread this exact message to the world.
</li><li> The manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gimmick">Gimmick</a>!</em> has a rather glaring example of this, after a flashback where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kohei takes a job to do special effects for a video game commercial, which turns out to be a government conspiracy that takes the commercial and re-edits it into a post-9/11 pro-war viral video.</span> After the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of Kohei's friends from Hollywood joins the Iraq War because of it and gets killed</span>, Kohei launches into a "Don't be fooled by images" rant about how Hollywood (and American media in general) is always sneaking subliminal messages into movies and commercials and such, saying how filmmakers just want to make movies, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executives keep interfering to cram their evil propaganda into every crack and crevice</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekazHimaruya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekazHimaruya">Hidekaz Himaruya</a> tries to avoid this in his work. Although the closest he gets to this trope can be found in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> arc which bemoans Japan losing elements of his traditional culture, which is more in context of the changes brought about by Westernization rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>.

Lupin<em>s</em> chasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">The Ice Cube</a>, which turns out to be a source of nuclear power, and the creators use it to condemn the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>:
<ul><li> It has always been a quintessentially British series, and as such is usually penned by authors from the isles. Starting with writer Jamie Delano and including Garth Ennis and Mike Carey, all the authors the series has had usually ended up using the series as a vehicle to criticize and point out the worst aspects of British politics, economics, and popular culture. Many storylines cover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s economic policies and her handling of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar">The Falklands War</a>, for example, and the general woes of British society are firmly analyzed and represented as equal or worse than any supernatural threat the protagonist himself faces.
</li><li> The series also had a running theme of questioning authority, probably best exemplified by Constantine's infuriated monologue at the end of the "Dangerous Habits" arc.
</li></ul></li><li> As Jhonen Vazquez's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a></em> went on, more and more text began appearing that dealt with the main character's philosophical doubts, to the point that the panels would usually carry more text than drawings.
</li><li> As part of the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> during the run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a></em>, Dave Sim replaced parts of his comic with fine-print screeds detailing his legendary misogyny, which even diehard fans who continued to read the comic do their very best to ignore.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko">Steve Ditko</a> may have been a master comic book storyteller, but when he did not have a collaborator like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> to restrain him, his comics became notorious for the Objectivist philosophical lectures that dominated his more personal stories. The <em>Mr. A</em> stories are by far the worst, though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a></em> could be just as bad at times.
</li><li> The five issues long series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Warrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Warrior">Warrior</a></em>, a licensed comic about every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> fan's favorite crackpot, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, is one great big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">Wall of Text</a> after another meant to elucidate the reader on Warrior's bizarre mystical-reactionary philosophy and paint Warrior as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a>.

The one issue this doesn't apply to? The Christmas special, a completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDialogueEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDialogueEpisode">dialogue-less issue</a> in which Warrior goes to the North Pole, puts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">in bondage</a>, steals his clothes, <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and possibly rapes him</span></em>. There's a reason that every wrestling fan on the planet has agreed that the guy is nucking futs. It's bad enough to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/bt/spoonyone/reviews/7238-warrior1">mess with the space-time continuum!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Matt Fraction's first issue of the <em>Invincible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> comic has young villain supergenius Ezekiel Stane, fresh from his latest round of building and selling WMDs to genocidal terrorists, stop to spend four pages testing out his latest weaponry on the board of directors of a tobacco company, while delivering a rant on a) the evils of smoking and b) why, despite Ezekiel's long list of crimes against humanity, he is still infinitely morally superior to people who grow and sell tobacco.
</li><li> Oddly enough, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Doom">Doom comic</a> (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.doomworld.com/10years/doomcomic/comic.php?page=11">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) did this too, interrupting the plotless violence with a rant about how radioactive waste is killing the environment. This may well be a parody of the tradition, though, assuming that the comic is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">parody</a> to begin with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em>, whose main character's inflammatory news articles, while only sometimes political, and definitely in-character (insofar as Spider is an homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> responded to complaints about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea">Promethea</a></em> by saying something along the lines of, "There are hundreds of comics out there that aren't a didactic on magic, isn't there room for just one that is?"

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a> espoused his world view at length in <em>The Bear and the Dragon</em>.
</li><li> It started to become really obvious with <em>Executive Order</em>.
</li><li> In a Tom Clancy book, John Clark thought to himself that a movie, implied to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a></em> (which in reality did pretty well with critics), was a stupid movie that makes airport security overly diligent. This is most likely an indirect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>, whom Tom Clancy had hated as Jack Ryan.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in the genre, the protagonist in the W.E.B. Griffen book, <em>The Hostage</em>, Charley Castillo, thinks to himself that he likes Mel Gibson movies, and goes into detail about why, which has no relevance to the plot. It would come off strongly as product placement if Gibson was a product.

<ul><li> The book leaves approximately half the key plot points unresolved in favor of the heroes making every rant possible on the subject of global warming.
</li><li> There was also a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a> where one character has to babysit some guy who begins espousing social and media theories that have nothing whatsoever to do with global warming or anything else in the rest of the book (yet end up being what the book is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">named after</a>).
</li><li> At the end of the book, Crichton gives up all pretext and includes a section literally just ranting about his personal views without even bothering to put them in the mouth of a character.
</li><li> While not a filibuster, the book also contains an odd and rather distasteful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at one of Crichton's critics by making him a child molester with a small dick.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>: Ian Malcolm spends better than half of his scenes in the book making pages-long speeches about the evils of modern science, despite the fact that he is supposedly dying at the time (and a scientist himself). There is occasionally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>, like when Malcolm is cranked out of his mind on morphine and is just babbling whatever thoughts come into his head.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Next" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Next">Next</a></em> warns of the dangers of Big Genetics, hamfisting the point in at every available opportunity, with an epilogue followed by a didactic author's note, just to make sure that the subtlety of his point could, in fact, cause a concussion.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Wakefield</em> by Andrei Codrescu does this over and over on a wide variety of subjects but at least has a certain self-knowledge. Kudos for when, after the main character gives a lengthy speech about the relationship between art and money, another character tells him he's "full of shit".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillOReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillOReilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s fiction book, from before he was really famous, <em>Those Who Trespass</em>, can be bolied down one filibuster after the other , from two characters that essentially play two sides of his personality, one of which is a cold-blooded killer who takes revenge on those who fired him from television, while the other is an Irish cop who blabs on about the errors he predicts in the OJ Simpson trial, which was a few months away in the book's time.
</li><li> Emmanuel Goldstein's book in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a></em>, plus a drunken proletarian's rant against the metric system. The story of the novel is largely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> for Orwell's vision of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a>, and the book-within-a-book can be skipped by the reader without missing anything important to the plot. He also spends about ten pages near the end of <em>1984</em> driving the message home, just in case the reader missed the thinly-veiled metaphor of the first hundred or so pages.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em> is an excuse for myriad Author Filibusters about whaling, whaling culture, the anatomy of whales, and lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">sperm-wringing</a>. Plus all the classical references. Then there are those that interpret the whole book as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> about religion, where Ahab was trying to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> by using Moby Dick as a substitute. It's worth pointing out that author Herman Melville was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearboy">paid by the word,</a> so it's likely that all these filibusters are there just to pad Melville's wallet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vegetarians get their say in the second book. Humorously, Paolini seems to change his mind after this, as Eragon rationalizes eating meat in the third book. The anti-religion message is just as bad or worse. It looks like it's forced in — plot going on, scene change, random out-of-nowhere scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Oromis</a> makes some relatively basic atheism arguments that are treated as fact, scene change, back to the story's actual plot. And then Eragon changes his mind about that <em>as well</em>.
</li><li> Elves tend to be a lot wiser and more attuned to nature than any other creature because of the nature of their magic that bound their whole race in their blood oath with the dragons. As a result, they can't eat meat any more than a person could eat their own hand because they can feel the emotions from all the life around them, and if a creature dies, it feels like they themselves are dying along with it. They sing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ljrg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ljrg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ljrg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they speak in the ancient language combined with a flow of magic. The singing part is just their own artistic flair.</span> to the trees to harvest fruits and vegetables that grow all the nutrition they need, so there's no need to butcher animals. With all their needs taken care of, the elves don't fight wars and most are content to keep to themselves and pursue whatever they fancy, be it writing, painting, or being a fish. However, when pressed, they will rise up together to fight off whatever force threatens them.
</li><li> Dwarves, on the other hand, have their central religion and set of customs and traditions that probably vary between the clans and deep dwellers and can get very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">riled up</a> if their beliefs are challenged, but they also have the most marvelous and luxurious empires in the entire continent, and as a social collective, they seem to have a lot more fun in life than the elves. On top of all this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dwarves might actually be right about their religion; in <em>Brisingr</em>, Eragon actually <em>sees</em> what could very well be their god.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in the original novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>, when author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman">William Goldman</a> (in his guise as the alleged "editor") discusses how he cut out scores of pages of boring political lectures and discussions from the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">original book</a>". A big part of the metaplot is that it's the fun, pulp fantasy-esque parts from a <em>very</em> long, <em>terribly</em> grownup novel that included a detailed description of the contents of Princess Buttercup's massive closet as a joke that only someone with a PhD in History would get. Goldman parodies his own parody in the excerpts from <em>Buttercup's Baby</em>, (the sequel) that are provided in some editions of the novel - he describes in detail how a major stumbling block in getting his annotation of the sequel off the ground is the fact that Morgenstern's estate took a dim view of his chopping away Morgenstern's filibustering, as they view that as an integral part of the original work.
</li><li> The final third of Upton Sinclair's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungle">The Jungle</a></em> is a rambling treatise on the virtues of socialism. Most readers only noticed his nauseating descriptions of contemporary meat-packing practices. As Sinclair himself noted, he'd aimed for the country's heart, but missed and hit it in the stomach.
</li><li> Terry Goodkind's main characters in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series frequently stop to give ranty, self-important speeches espousing a fantasy version of his Objectivist philosophy. The fact that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto">doesn't consider himself a fantasy writer</a> adds a lot of weight to this one — even if the Aesops are <em>invariably</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">broken into little teeny pieces</a>. The later books feature pages-long speeches seemingly every other chapter. It wouldn't be so bad if the topics covered weren't <em>what they just said</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> was fond of these, using them in quite a few of his works. Some readers actually enjoy them. Not all of course.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> is full of long speeches on why war is necessary and the attitudes necessary in being a soldier, as well as sermons on the topic of "spare the rod, spoil the child."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> has several long rants on subjects ranging from tyranny and revolution, to limited government, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">polyamory</a>. The last was also a frequent topic in his later works as well, to the point that the group marriages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> seem rather tame by comparison.
</li><li> The last third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GloryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GloryRoad">Glory Road</a></em> is essentially a long libertarian diatribe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> has one of two epilogues of the novel devoted to espousing Leo Tolstoy's view of history. If you have read the book beforehand, there's no real need to read that particular epilogue. The majority of Tolstoy's output is this trope. One of his earlier, shorter works is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">Fix Fic</a> to a woman who rejected him (oops), while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina">Anna Karenina</a></em> turned from a straightforward bit of realist fiction to an epic due to Tolstoy's decision to add a second plot complete with an author avatar to expound on the joys of mowing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a> goes this direction in <em>The Final Warning</em>. In the first three books, the main characters were always on the move and in danger, fighting for their lives against evil scientists, and keeping a low profile. In this book, Max and the flock are brought to Antarctica to combat <strong>global warming</strong>. The commentary is there but not overwhelming until the last few pages of the book (before the epilogue), which has Max <em>making a speech to the US Congress</em> (a <em>literal</em> filibuster) concerning global warming and referencing the current big thing about compact fluorescent light bulbs (that if every house replaced one normal bulb with one of these, it would be "like taking a million cars off the road"). The protagonist of this series was the subject of kidnapping and human experimentation but goes out of his way to state that global warming is worse than those things. The speech also contains a lot of America-bashing (pig-headed, short-sighted, arrogant, etc).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyChatterleysLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyChatterleysLover">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a></em> has several rants on how industrial growth is killing nature and humanity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenBasicPlots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenBasicPlots">The Seven Basic Plots</a></em> by Christopher Booker contains a lengthy rant on why <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover</em> is an awful book.
</li><li> Book Three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NativeSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NativeSon">Native Son</a></em>, particularly toward the end, and at its absolute worst during each of the two speeches during Bigger's trial, especially by Bigger's attorney; each of these speeches went on for over 20 pages of the book. The longest one was exactly 24 pages.
</li><li> <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> contains a lot of Gibbon's anti-religious sentiment (he blamed its fall on the Church.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> could never resist the temptation to embellish his characters' actions via moralistic asides, sometimes lighthearted, more often disgusted. Since his books tend to contain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, he does this a <em>lot</em>, in his later, socially-aware novels especially.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExecutioner">The Executioner</a> series of action novels was written by Don Pendleton in the 1970s in response to the anti-war and "violence doesn't solve anything" attitudes of the time. Its hero, Vietnam veteran turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">vigilante</a> Mack Bolan, spends entire chapters pondering the morality of violence and the nature of his "war everlasting".
</li><li> The last published part of Geoffrey Chaucer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em> with a long sermon by the Parson on the Seven Deadly Sins. While there may have been more later on, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">dying before he finished the Tales</a>, it's left to speculation.
</li><li> People familiar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables">the musical version</a> of <em>Les Misérables</em> are certain to be rather confused by numerous dissertations on such things as local linguistics, Hugo's thoughts on convents, the life of a side character bishop, the governance of a town, the Battle of Waterloo, and the Paris sewer system in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">the original work</a> so that the filibustering seems to take up more space than the actual storytelling.
</li><li> Parodied in <em>Mason &amp; Dixon</em>, when Dixon goes on a several page speech about the mythological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLambtonWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLambtonWorm">Lambton Worm</a>, and by the time he gets to the end, he can't remember what his point was in bringing it up.
</li><li> In <em>The Ethical Assassin</em>, the title character says almost nothing that isn't Author Filibuster. The last conversation sounds like it's the titular assassin delivering the jacket blurb.
</li><li> In some of John Norman's later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor">Gor</a></em> novels, what the plot halts quite often for a character to go on another rant about how a woman's proper place is kneeling at his feet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s otherwise pretty good collection of loosely-related short stories, <em>The Boat of a Million Years</em> veers into this trope. The author apparently can't help himself from launching into angry rants against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">liberalism</a> and expressing the view that libertarianism is the best thing ever.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dansimmons.com/news/message/2006_04.htm">short story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Dan Simmons posted onto his website is a rant on how Islam will destroy the world if left unchecked.
</li><li> In the original 1818 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, during the scene in which Elizabeth and Victor are visiting the condemned Justine Moritz, Mary Shelley allows Elizabeth to go into a completely inappropriate rant against the inhumanity of the death penalty (Shelley and her husband Percy were strongly against it) - inappropriate for that dramatic moment, anyway, because Elizabeth is meant to be there comforting and consoling her friend who's just been condemned <em>under</em> the death penalty. This led one editor of the 1818 edition to remark that Elizabeth isn't the sort of friend you'd call on to cheer you up if you've had a bad day... <em>Frankenstein</em> has no fewer than three separate narrators (even more if you count the letters from family members that Victor quotes verbatim), and all of them to some degree deliver little sermons on topics that are only tangentially related to the novel's theme. Oddest of all, the story proper is recounted in the form of a series of letters written by (fictional) Arctic explorer Robert Walton, whose ship is trapped in ice as the novel begins (which, for modern-day readers, must amount to the greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutOpening">Fake-Out Opening</a> in history). Mary, in fact, began writing her story with the creation of the monster itself but was encouraged by her husband to expand it to full length, belatedly adding Walton and all the rest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>:
<ul><li> <em>Making History</em> contains at least one conversation full of remarks the author himself has made in interviews. The line "Just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">science doesn't know everything</a> doesn't mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">science knows nothing</a>" stands out. There's also the "beautiful words" sketch from <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em>, which is <em>all</em> filibuster by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> character. He did a podcast where he makes many of the same points, only seriously.
</li><li> In the category of "anvils that definitely should have stayed where they were," <em>The Hippopotamus</em> has a lengthy passage on the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">women don't enjoy sex</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">only say they do because they need to be in a relationship</a>. This is something Fry said in at least one TV interview about twenty years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> does this a <em>lot</em>. He keeps you on your toes, too - sometimes he's just rambling about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy">Restoration Comedy</a> for no good reason, but sometimes the five-page demonstration of van Eck phreaking will turn out to be a key plot point. Stephenson's filibusters tend to be less telling us about his political views and more about his almost obsessive desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">show his work</a> (think the long discussion on Sumerian religion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em>).
</li><li> Terry Pratchett succumbed to this in later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books, as he began to use the series to express his views on the world. A major example is the argument between Sacharissa and William in <em>The Truth</em> on the true purpose of news media, in which William may as well be holding a card that says "VIEWPOINT OF TERRY PRATCHETT". Pratchett was an atheist and a humanist, something that won't surprise anyone who has read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> or the exchanges between Granny Weatherwax and Oates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>.
</li><li> Like so many other things of the literature scene, this gets heavily satirized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterMoers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterMoers">Walter Moers</a> in many of his books through his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny Ears</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> Hildegunst von Mythenmetz (Optimus Yarnspinner in the English translation). The plot of the books is actually a story inside a story, that is told by Hildegunst who is constantly breaking the fourth wall (which is in fact, an in-story fourth wall) to comment on the story he is currently writing down. Moers hangs a giant lampshade on it by having Hildegunst invent the <em>Mythenmetzian Tangent</em>, a literary device in which the author stops telling his story and instead talks about something entirely else. Be it the interior decoration of his study, or a rant directed at his most hated critic, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">entire pages of the word "Brumli"</a>. Hildegunst does, however, fail to explain the purpose of this device, which is completely intentional.
</li><li> <em>Just a Couple of Days</em> by Tony Vigorito is entirely made out of this trope. The fact that the author attempts to justify this via the protagonist complaining about how depressed or scattered he is feeling is embarrassing at best and infuriating at worst.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>: Parodied and lampshaded by Cervantes. The critics said that the chivalry books were plagued by a lot of lengthy discourses from a lot of different abstract themes, immobilizing the action and discouraging the reader. Cervantes was a great writer, so maybe his intent at author filibuster could not be boring, but the reactions of the people who listen to them are very realistic: Don Quixote talks for nearly two pages in the "Discourse on The Golden Age", Part I, Chapter XI, and for almost six pages in the "Discourse on Arms and Letters", Part I, Chapter XXXVIII. The first filibuster is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>: <em>"All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply."</em> and in the second the action really never stops, because all the other characters have their dinners while Don Quixote talked... for 6 pages and 2 chapters!: <em>"All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterward to say all he wanted."</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HansBrinkerOrTheSilverSkates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HansBrinkerOrTheSilverSkates">The Silver Skates</a></em> devotes lengthy chunks of the book - including a long side-story only little related to the main plot - to facts about the country of Holland, its culture and history, and why it is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">completely awesome</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> series has this in spades. Each of the 16 books brings the narrative to a full stop on at least one occasion to provide sermons that are several pages in length. The final book, Kingdom Come, is especially bad as it spends a chapter retelling the stories of 3 Old Testament figures.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheLastDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheLastDays">Children of the Last Days</a></em> series by Michael D. O'Brien is essentially a very conservative Catholic version of the above, with a hefty dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take Thats</a> against the modern world.

There's hardly any in the first two books, but the third book, <em>Acts of God</em>, frequently gets bogged down in Christian sermonizing.
</li><li> Professor Michael Murphy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabylonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabylonRising">Babylon Rising</a> series frequently lectures his students, friends, and acquaintances on the correctness of his conservative Christian views. It just so happens that Murphy's creator, Tim LaHaye (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> fame) is a conservative Christian.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, the Oompa Loompas' poem about Mike Teavee is almost entirely devoted to a lengthy rant about how too much TV is bad for kids, and that everyone should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">get rid of their television and install a bookshelf in its place</a>. Mike Teavee himself is only mentioned in a post-script.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnVarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnVarley">John Varley</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GaeaTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GaeaTrilogy">Gaea Trilogy</a></em> frequently lapses into this trope, whenever the characters get preachy about sexual politics and/or religion.
<ul><li> There's also a weird lecture in <em>Demon</em> about how the "real" rock-and-roll genre of music died out in the disco years, and how '80s-era rock (i.e. music from when <em>Demon</em> was written) was sold-out overhyped garbage. As this digression is uttered by an alien centaur from the 22nd century, and one who's <em>performing brain surgery</em> at the time, it's about as out-of-place as this trope can get.
</li><li> <em>Red Thunder</em> has a long speech about how the space program was ruined by Kennedy's challenge to reach the moon before 1970 and how space travel <em>should</em> have progressed.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneRice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneRice">Anne Rice</a> is simply magnificent at this trope, especially in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles">The Vampire Chronicles</a></em> series. It's obvious when it's happening because a conversation between two characters (usually involving religion) can span chapters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lestat and Marius' conversations near the end of <em>The Vampire Lestat</em> spring to mind</span>), and often go over the same points over and over and over again. Lestat does this quite often, especially in the later <em>Chronicles</em> books; the worst example is when he takes time in the preface of <em>Blood Canticle</em> to complain about the fans' reaction to Memnoch the Devil, saying more-or-less that he gave them a glimpse into the mysteries of Heaven and Hell and all they wanted was "the fancy fiend" with glamorous leather and heavy motorcycles. He assures them that there's plenty of traditional badassery to go around but that he'll get to it when he's good and ready. Chapter 7 of the same novel has nothing to do with the plot or the series but is a three-page rave about the new Pope and the canonization of Juan Diego, the first indigenous American saint.

<ul><li> The book <em>Night of the Humans</em> is essentially one long rant about how awful and evil every single religion is.
</li><li> <em>The Last Dodo</em> is a similar rant from earlier in the series about preserving endangered species.
</li></ul></li><li> Every time someone is mentioned as using pot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em> series the plot gets temporarily derailed so Zoey and her friends can rant about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">doing pot is so uncool and stupid</a>. In <em>Betrayed</em>, we find out that Neferet specifically chooses students to feed to the red-eyed vampires just because Zoey ratted them out to her as having used pot. When the police confront Zoey about the deaths, Neferet tries to blame it all on the victims falling in the river after being high, which sounds uncomfortably like "they were asking to die a brutal death!" And while Neferet is the bad guy, Zoey in no way ever contradicts or debates that argument, and since younger generations tend to have a more liberal attitude about pot (with most thinking that while it may not be good, you can do worse things to yourself) it comes off as even more dissonant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries">Sisterhood Series</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels">Fern Michaels</a>: Well, this series has gone into this trope a number of times. The book <em>Payback</em> portrays a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) as the scum of the earth who suck up your money like leeches, use that money to pamper themselves, and will simply stand back and not lift a finger to help you as you die of a life-threatening illness. The book <em>Vendetta</em> portrays China as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> that cheerfully brings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Yellow Peril</a> wherever it goes! The book <em>The Jury</em> has one character Nikki Quinn tell the other characters about the vicious cycle of abuse between spouses. The book <em>Fast Track</em> portrays the World Bank (particularly its president) as a money-sucker that will leave poor countries to rot and die. The book <em>Under the Radar</em> portrays a polygamist sect as a cult made up of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptHick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptHick">Corrupt Hick</a>, rapists, and pedophiles hiding behind religion and treating women as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyFactory">Baby Factory</a>.
</li><li> Mat Coward's <em>Success... And How to Avoid It</em> is a funny book about being a freelance writer, which periodically breaks off the jokes to talk about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was out to ruin Britain and referring to her time in office as the "Time of Evil".
</li><li> David Weber does it sometimes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em>, especially in later books. Sometimes war-ridden, fast-paced narrative come to halt and we are treated to a chapter that is nothing but yet another Maikel Staynair's lecture on the evils of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a> is known for these:
<ul><li> The wild adventures in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars">Council Wars</a></em> novels at one point come to a screeching halt as they're sitting around a fire and Edmund explains how humans in the late 20th/early 21st centuries were just so damn silly for believing in a clearly absurd thing like human-caused climate change (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">while getting the cause of it wrong</a>).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>'s <em>Troy Rising</em> series, much of the third book is about how South Americans are lazy and entitled to the point of suicidal negligence. It's also brought up near the climax that Afghani citizens are taught to make explosives at their grandfather's knee, and are second to none when fighting in caves.
</li><li> In <em>Princess Of Wands</em>, a hunt for a soul-eating demon is interrupted so that the main character can lecture a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLiberal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLiberal">Straw Liberal</a> about how awful abortion is and how it should be banned, based on her religious views. China gets cited as a country with "mandatory abortions" that's still overpopulated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">ignoring that China's extreme population control measures are the result of its overpopulation, not the cause</a>, and that the main character is supposed to be Episcopalian, which as a Christian denomination has aligned strongly pro-choice.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the classic Dutch novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxHavelaar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxHavelaar">Max Havelaar</a></em>, the author himself takes the stage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveNarrator">shoos his characters away</a>, and delivers a rant which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a> rams the point of the book - that the people of Java are being <em>sorely</em> mistreated - home.

</div></li><li> In Joseph Heller's novel <em>Good as Gold</em>, the narrative stops dead for about forty pages while the author delivers a massive rant about Henry Kissinger, how he's a lying, murdering scumbag and how, worst of all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking">he isn't even really Jewish</a>.
</li><li> Joseph Conrad's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartOfDarkness">Heart of Darkness</a></em> (1902) is a psychological thriller masquerading as an African adventure story, but even before the psychological element takes center stage, the novella's protagonist, Charlie Marlowe, veers away from pure narrative at times to talk about his spiritual awakening (or spiritual death, as the case may be) while in the Congo. For several pages at a time, we come upon extensive philosophical treatises that were considered long-winded and dull even in Conrad's time. Partly justified by the fact that Marlowe is actually, in-story, speaking to a group of friends on a boat, and it is an unnamed first-person narrator listening to Marlowe who both opens and concludes the whole thing.
</li><li> Ray Bradbury's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SomethingWickedThisWayComes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SomethingWickedThisWayComes">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a></em> usually doesn't have much, except for Charles Halloway. Four pages that's nothing but a lecture.
</li><li> The Marquis de Sade was quite fond of this trope, interposing his famously depraved sex scenes with just as many, if less famous, lengthy rhetorics about the pointlessness of morality in a Godless universe and the glories of hedonism. <em>Philosophy in the Bedroom</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">probably the most blatant example</a>. Though this is actually something of a subversion: in De Sade's day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow">the word "philosophy" in a book title used to be code for "porn".</a> The title (and his then-already-infamous name) capitalize on this — only to show readers a woman walking into a brothel, picking up a pamphlet lying on the piano... which is then given in full length, eclipsing anything else in the story. Even in <em>120 Days of Sodom</em>, which was allegedly written to be a catalog of different "passions", he can't help his philosophizing and the first part of the book (the 400 pages that were actually written, as opposed to just notes researchers have found) intertwines "tame" (for De Sade, that means water sports/scat, by the by) non-penetrative sexual scenes with why the four main characters are justified in their future torture and murder of their captives. Some have interpreted this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> of the day's aristocracy and those who they share power with (and an example of how an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a> can still be Author Filibuster).

</li><li> A good deal of Petr Beckmann's <em>A History of Pi</em> is, by word count, rants against the Soviet Union. <em>In a book about mathematics</em>. It isn't <em>quite</em> as misplaced as you'd think: Beckmann viewed the Soviet Union as the benchmark for anything and everything irrational, so whenever he would discuss cranks who try to "square a circle" or some such, he would inevitably compare them to official Soviet policy (a bit hypocritically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate">as Beckmann was a major crank himself</a>.)
</li><li> An early chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a> and the Redskins</em> has the protagonist encounter a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">well-off liberals</a> discussing the ill-treatment of Native Americans. Flashman spends the next five pages or so haranguing them on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">why they are idiots</a> for entertaining an absurdly romanticized view of the American West.
</li><li> Dutch children's book <em>De Griezelbus</em> ("The Spooky Bus") involves an author of scary stories telling a number of his stories to a class of schoolchildren on a bus. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The author later turns out to be a werewolf who intends to eat the children.</span>) At one point, one of the children asks him why doesn't tell <em>real</em> scary stories, like those movies his brother watches in which "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">arms and legs are flying around</a>". The author replies, and is presumably channeling the author of the <em>book</em> here: "That's not scary, that's disgusting!"

The author considered deleting it, but decided that a thorough knowledge of the conditions at the time was necessary for the audience to understand why the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots himself in the foot to escape from battle</span>.

He also tries to soften it later on by admitting that 1958 has its downsides, in particular, the outrageous levels of racism that are still common, and asking the reader to remember that the next time he starts gushing about how much he loves the time period. He further admits that he's personally exempt from one of the greatest drawbacks of living during the Cold War - <em>he</em> knows that there won't be a nuclear war, whereas other characters have to live in fear of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTommyknockers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTommyknockers">The Tommyknockers</a></em>, Gard goes on a lo-o-o-ong diatribe about the evils of nuclear power when he overhears a power company bigwig (or so Gard assumes) extolling the virtues of it and downplaying the Chernobyl disaster. Partially justified in that Gard is blitzed out of his skull and is also said to be obsessive about the subject.

It is stated that the Three Mile Island accident forever turned the world against its use, to the extent that humans would rather burn oil or coal instead. Even the name of the place is taboo to mention centuries afterward. This doesn't bear any resemblance to the real world even when the book was published (in 1985, six years after the accident).

More still when Oliver imagines himself as Dante in Hell: "Oliver reserved the first circle for the writers of novels who censored their own work so as not to fall foul of politically correct editors... The second circle would be reserved for the editors and publishers who were scared of anything that wasn't politically correct... In the next circle, he put cowardly politicians...

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenTraviss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenTraviss">Karen Traviss</a> does this in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> novels (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands">Glasslands</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar">The Thursday War</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata">Mortal Dictata</a></em>) regarding Dr. Halsey and the SPARTAN-II program. This is usually done from the viewpoint of Margaret Parangosky, the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">ONI</a>, and Serin Osman (one of the Spartan-IIs whose augs failed). As far as Parangosky (and Traviss, of course) is concerned, Halsey is Dr. Mengele for having abducted innocent children and replaced them with clones that got sick and died shortly after. Traviss expects the readers to believe that Parangosky, who claims to know <em>everything</em> that goes on in both the UNSC and her own ONI, somehow had no idea that Halsey was planning on using clones instead of simply abducting children (NOTE: she was perfectly fine with abductions, it was cloning that was a problem) for the program. Even Chief Mendez suddenly decides that he has always thought that Halsey was a monster, even though in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx">Ghosts of Onyx</a></em> (different author) he was glad to see her. Interestingly, Traviss has no problems with the SPARTAN-III program because the kids for that program were not abducted but were merely orphans. Just to be clear, Traviss doesn't have a problem with using child soldiers, as long as they're given a choice. What she fails to point out is that these children had recently lost their parents to the Covenant, and ONI was basically telling them "Wanna avenge your Mommy and Daddy? Just sign here." Also for reference, the S-IIs who survived augmentations went on to have a fairly high survival rate (with most of them surviving into adulthood), whereas the S-IIIs, which Halsey had no involvement with, were basically cannon fodder who were designed to be cheap and expendable (with most of them dying in their early teens). A good number of <em>Halo</em> fans hated Traviss's books because of this, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThreeFourThreeIndustries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThreeFourThreeIndustries">343 Industries</a> have somewhat distanced themselves from the most contentious elements of Traviss's novels.

It's made even more jarring when the murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is suddenly totally convinced by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">proto-StarClan</span> that he should give peace a chance- despite violently opposing the idea <em>a day</em> ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpectralShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpectralShadows">Spectral Shadows</a></em> got this with Serial 11, which serves as a vehicle for the author to do various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">"Take That!"s</a> to, well, anything they didn't like. Somewhat of a subversion in that, while the author does use the plot and characters to express her viewpoints the story doesn't grind to a halt. The closest you get to the plot stopping are characters discussing ideas for a few minutes of plot time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfTheSierraMadre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTreasureOfTheSierraMadre">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></em>, the narrator takes time out to give his opinions on the Catholic Church, the rich, and colonial governments. (He's not a fan of any of them). On one occasion, the headman of an Indian village delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">page and a half long sermon</a> on the futility of seeking gold and the value of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">good company, good farmland and good livestock</a>.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey">Northanger Abbey</a></em>, Jane Austen takes a few paragraphs to rail about anti-novel snobbery that held novels to be low and trashy.
</li><li> Lauren Beukes' <em>Broken Monsters</em> has five point-of-view characters. Four of them focus on the main plot, centered around bizarre serial killings that may be supernatural in origin. The fifth point of view character is almost entirely focused on a side plot about cyberbullying and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a>. To boot, guess which of the five characters gets the most time in the spotlight?
</li><li> Even the greatest authors are not immune to lapsing into this trope—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a>'s early "lost novel" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParisInTheTwentiethCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParisInTheTwentiethCentury">Paris in the Twentieth Century</a></em> dedicates an entire chapter to explaining why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> and his imitators had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever">Ruined Music Forever</a> with their edgy and angsty new style.
</li><li> Alfred Noyes's <em>The Last Man</em> (1940) has a lot of lengthy passages where the narrator dwells on how corrupt and godless the contemporary elites are (or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">were</a>).
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair">The Silver Chair</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation">Kirk Summation</a> about the value of faith. Even <em>if</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Aslan</a> and the surface world aren't objectively real, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDefeatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedDefeatist">Puddleglum</a> asserts, his belief is far more meaningful than the villain's bleak so-called reality. The speech still manages to be rather impressive; it helps that it's not too long-winded as far as Author Filibusters go.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MLLanzillotta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MLLanzillotta">ML Lanzillotta</a> sure doesn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighteenDaysToGraduation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighteenDaysToGraduation">psychiatrists</a> or the war on drugs.
</li><li> <em>The Dance</em> By Suzie Carr interrupts the plot more than one to go on at length about how wonderful bees are and what a threat their dying off is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em>: Many times, especially in the later books, Richard would deliver messages which reflected the author's own views (some other characters occasionally do this too). It's rare that such views were in any respect foreshadowed or justified by what we know about the characters, and often those who they speak with put up only token objections <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">before quickly converting</a> to them, even if they went against some very old, ingrained belief systems.
</li><li> Frank Herbert had a tendency to do these, especially in <em>Chapterhouse: Dune,</em> his final <em>Dune</em> novel. His characters think about various topics for pages and pages, often about things that have nothing to do with the story. (For example, his Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother protagonist reflects that the partial suppression of drugs at the border only romanticizes them. There are no borders shown in the <em>Dune</em> universe on the sub-planetary level.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babylon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babylon">Babylon</a></em> has a few examples of this, but it's no more apparent in the final half of the second novel/eleventh episode of the anime, where the world leaders at the G7 Summit take up pages discussing how the concept of human morality and good and evil are essentially meaningless and all boil down to mankind's most base animal instinct to keep existing.

</li></ul></li><li> More of a "Host Filibuster," but after learning that <em>The Dennis Miller Show</em> was going to be canceled, embittered host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisMiller">Dennis Miller</a> began to break show format in the few remaining episodes to air his personal grievances on a number of social and political issues. His biting, humorous rants, dotted with his trademark obscure references, became the foundation for his follow-up show, <em>Dennis Miller Live</em>, in which he performed a scripted rant in each episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em> season five has a major moment (Claudette Wyms being promoted to Captain of the Farmington Precinct) interrupted for an Author Filibuster in the form of Internal Affairs officer Jon Kavanaugh interrupting the meeting where Claudette gets her promotion, to deliver a foaming at the mouth rant where the character (serving as the voicebox for Shawn Ryan and the rest of the writers of the series) goes off on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a> of the Vic Mackey character.

Most fitting the trope was the episode where numerous characters discuss at bizarre length the necessity of buying name-brand batteries from a reputable retailer. Seriously, they spend a whole scene on it.
</li><li> The leviathan arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> was basically one long rant about the evils of big business.

Remember that in this world, Olivia Marsden (who is secretly an alien of the extraterrestrial kind) is the US President and Cat Grant is her press secretary. It would be extremely out of character for them to advocate for building a wall to keep out Mexicans. This was very clearly shoehorned criticism of President Trump's statements and plans to do just that when this had aired, no matter how unrealistic in the show.

This is a reference to Boy's Theater, a form of English theater that was outside the legal restrictions that made Shakespeare's company one of only two legal companies in England. So Shakespeare's dislike of Child's Theater is understandable, given that they were his chief competition next to bear-baiting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>, the entire "Speak the speech I pray you" monologue is usually seen as Shakespeare's critique on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">typical acting methods</a> of the day.

<ul><li> In <em>Small Potatos</em> Shaenon doesn't show anything of the episode, instead sitting on the couch and telling the readers her feelings about it.

Junior, the man behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TalesOfTheQuestor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TalesOfTheQuestor">Tales of the Questor</a></em>, apparently thought that the subtle right-wing Christian elements of his comics and his very political journal weren't enough, and decided to interrupt his cutesy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Narnia</a></em>-like allegory about an adventuring raccoon kit with a completely out-of-the-blue ramble.

Also happens in his other comics <em>Nip and Tuck</em> and <em>Goblin Hollow</em>.

While he's dead serious, the way he presents the rant, with comic!Dan nearly foaming at the mouth, makes it an amusing aside rather than a truly jarring interruption.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2001-01-07">has a moment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where Kevyn starts on a rant about the evils of government bureaucracy, only to be caught by Schlock who mentions that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">"He senses an author's message incoming"</a> and making Kevyn realize what he just said.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em>, especially during the troll-influenced issues, usually have the eponymous character or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> complaining about stuff the author hates, mostly trolls and homosexuality. Issue 10 is the worst of the bunch, with at least three filibusters and, at one point, Sonichu even tells Chris to stop and get on with the story!
</li><li> In early chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Lightbringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Lightbringer">Lightbringer</a></em>, Lewis Lovhaug would often have the titular hero espouse his opinions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">taking up a good chunk of each page</a> particularly on his belief of an objective morality. Lovhaug has since expressed regret at using the comic to soapbox.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NerfNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NerfNow">Nerf NOW!!</a></em> has had these, especially prevalent post 2012. Early strips were cutesy things and game humour, but a lot of later strips were the author giving his opinion about something in the form of some political cartoon, or even adding some particularly Anvillicious commentary. (Though sometimes, they really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">dropped</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LeastICouldDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/LeastICouldDo">Least I Could Do</a></em> has a few arcs where protagonist Rayne will lecture other characters (and usually the audience) about how he's right and anyone who disagrees is wrong; probably the most infamous example is an arc set at a convention where he outright says "Webcomics suck", mainly because most webcomic artists don't/can't keep a consistent release schedule. The fact that nobody can ever debate Rayne, and that onlookers usually treat him like a genius, does nothing to help the perception that Rayne is Ryan Sohmer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaryStu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaryStu">Gary Stu</a> character.

<ul><li> Yahtzee has spent the better part of one video pointing out that calling rappers dipshits is not racist the fact that they're mostly black didn't even enter into it complete with the phrase "Unfunny Soapbox Bit" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">scrolling in the background</a>.
</li><li> Whenever Yahtzee's reviewing a Wii-game, expect at least one-and-a-half minutes of bashing the console <em>itself</em>, not because the game was awful, but because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">feels the need to remind us that, yes, he DOES hate this console</a>.

</li><li> And if it's any sort of shooter game (usually involving the American military, but that's not a hard and fast rule), expect a rant about how America is imperialistic and mean and sucks.
</li><li> Yahtzee's review of <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em> spends less time making fun of the game and more time making fun of Nintendo's business practices, accusing them of relying on nostalgia and gimmicky peripherals to sell consoles/games.

It should probably be noted that Bob's ranting about Megan has since become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> of his.
</li><li> His Star Trek review also included a long rant against the Tyler Perry cameo.

He has the decency to make it funny.
</li><li> He tends to also go off on political/social rants sometimes in his videos. A good example of this is the lengthy tirade about nuclear weapons in the <em>Superman IV</em> review. Some of it's justified given the movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">Clueless Aesop</a> but it still comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> at certain points.
</li><li> He also gave a rant about blatant and/or inappropriate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> in modern comics to start off his <em>Athena</em> #1 review.

Not only is this lampshaded by the stage directions (<strong>Alpharius</strong>...<strong>Alpharius again</strong>...<strong>Alpharius still isn't shutting up</strong>) but the chapter itself is titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">I Think This Qualifies As An Author Filibuster</a>"

He's also stopped to explain why he hates "White guy with acoustic guitar" songs so much on occasion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RegularCarReviews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RegularCarReviews">Regular Car Reviews</a> episode about Dodge Challenger Hellcat. In the 7 minute video, there are maybe a few offhand sentences about it being a very good and fast muscle car. The rest is mostly a rant about Chrysler spending its bailout money pursuing high-end, low volume muscle cars instead of trying to make a mass-market car that could actually make them money when they need it the most. Other videos feature Mr. Regular going completely off keister for some time, if not for most of the review. It's a source of much of the series humor and appeal.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has done a lot of this in its post-revival episodes to express the writers' generally left-wing views, usually without any self-parody.
<ul><li> There is one example of a parodical usage in the episode "Boys Do Cry", however. The message itself is completely sincere, but the way it's delivered is comedically heavy-handed, infused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that... you're an idiot. Maybe you should take responsibility for what values your kids are getting. Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves. [long pause] Yeah."
</div><ul><li> One particularly egregious example has an episode defending OJ Simpson and in the closing scenes there's an explanation about how it's wrong to judge others and it ends with OJ stabbing three people. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> infuriated many viewers who felt that they had just had a half hour of time stolen from them.
</li><li> A particularly horrifying example of a literal filibuster came from the same episode where they used up 5 minutes of their show playing... a Conway Twitty music video. The DVD commentary for that episode announces gleefully that they put it in for its whole ~5min run because people would assume that Fox was just not playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a>. They know how it is inappropriate for the show, and put the whole thing in to piss off the people who watch.
</li><li> Parodied in <em>The Road To Germany</em> when Stewie mocks Brian after he said an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards the war in Iraq.
</li><li> Quagmire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">reviled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> toward Brian in <em>Jerome is the New Black</em> seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> and a calling out of the many times Brian has been used as an author mouthpiece.
</li><li> Another episode had Stewie launch into one long and vitriolic tirade about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, particularly the "Mr. Plow" episode. It didn't make any sense to anything else in the episode (which is quite a feat considering how often the show does that) and came off more as something said out of bitterness and jealousy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. Although sometimes with mocking, many episodes are about what Trey Parker and Matt Stone find wrong in the world.
<ul><li> This has become increasingly apparent in later seasons. In a scene from "Whale Whores", the in-universe Larry King breaks character and diverts attention from the scene just to talk about how much he (that is, Matt and Trey) hates the host of <em>Whale Wars</em>. A previous episode had a scene that made fun of <em>Ghost Hunters</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">by repeating the same joke over and over again, that did not contribute anything to the plot of the episode and was a throwaway gag for something like five whole minutes</a>. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a>'s instances of author filibuster have not only become more jarring and (even) less subtle, have become increasingly focused upon more minor topics (such as currently-popular TV shows or trends).
</li><li> Ironically, South Park's actual morals are usually sarcastic and insincere, lampshaded in several episodes where the characters predict and rant against an upcoming moral following a series of misadventures. The sappy music as one of the characters (usually Stan or Kyle, though Cartman and other characters are sometimes given the moral for purposes of comedy and irony) lectures the entire town on some topic underscores the further aversion of this trope. It's possible that due to South Park's increasing reliance on themed episodes and their extremely rushed work schedule, this formula may just be a reliable way to end episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2005 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Ninja Turtles</a> episode "Sons of the Silent Age," Donatello goes off on a rant about nuclear power and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">awful</a> it is. At one point he even makes a comparison between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Purple Dragons</a> and a nearby power plant (which they destroy during the episode). Meanwhile, there is a <a class="urllink" href="http://the-5th-turtle.blogspot.com">guy on Mirage staff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who is very much an environmentalist and has mentioned working some of his views into scripts in the comics and cartoons. This may very well be an example. The writer in question, Steve Murphy, was responsible for both the cited episode and the original comic from which it was adapted.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has Beast Boy search off to find his spirit animal. The entire episode plays up the "search" for a spirit animal like entering into a four-year college to get a diploma. The issue of having BB enter a two-year technical school to find his spirit animal is brought up as a plot point. In the end, BB finds his spirit animal and is handed a piece of paper certifying it after all the hardships he endured. The episode finishes out with Cyborg giving a rant about how pathetic our educational systems are to try and validate hundreds of thousands of students by giving them a piece of paper and throwing them into an empty economy and job market, and force them to spend the rest of their lives with financial debt that they in all likelihood will never get paid off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost">Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooReturnToZombieIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooReturnToZombieIsland">Scooby-Doo: Return to Zombie Island</a></em> use Velma to give the writerss pretty obvious stance on the real monsters and magic used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The13GhostsOfScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The13GhostsOfScoobyDoo">The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooOnZombieIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooOnZombieIsland">Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island</a></em>: that they think real monsters and magic is a betrayal of the franchise, and they are now trying to fix it by retconning the supernatural phenomena with mundane explanations. This caused no shortage of divisiveness in the fandom since the original <em>Zombie Island</em> in particular is held in high regard for its refreshing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> take and legitimately helped save the franchise from extinction in the late 1990s. As a result, reception of the latter film is very mixed since the film bills itself as a legacy sequel of the original film, but spends most of its time tearing down what it built in favor of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> approach more akin to the original series. This stance against real monsters is also notably held by Derrick J. Wyatt, leading Art Director on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>, who campaigned against the shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that had a genuine supernatural presence during production (for the record, he also hates <em>Zombie Island</em>, but likes <em>13 Ghosts</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> way).

<ul><li> From the annals of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">United States Supreme Court</a>:
<ul><li> We have Justice Harry Blackmun's seven-page paean to the sport of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Baseball</a> opening his majority opinion in <em>Flood v. Kuhn</em>, 407 U.S. 258 (1972),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4acmq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4acmq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4acmq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note to baseball fans: This decision indirectly led to the development of free agency in baseball.</span> after which the whole thing becomes quite technical.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5p1lv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5p1lv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5p1lv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To summarize: Justice Blackmun says, basically: "As I noted for seven pages, many baseball players have been repeatedly screwed over by the antitrust exemption, and really, baseball doesn't really deserve to have it, <em>but</em> we don't have the usual ways to get out of <em>stare decisis</em>, so we're just going to have to uphold the stupid old decision that established the exemption in the first place. Sorry, ballplayers; you'll have to go to Congress to fix your problem."</span> Everyone thought that this was unbecoming of a major judicial decision. The justices who joined in Blackmun's opinion explicitly noted that they did not join in the opening seven pages. Blackmun defended himself by saying that he intended to show how baseball players were affected by the issues in the case and that the Court had started to take itself far too seriously and needed to lighten up a bit and show some humanity.
</li><li> A more serious filibuster is found in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=651942663214964557">Davis v. Ayala,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> 576 U.S. ___, 135 S.Ct. 2187 (2015), in which Justice Anthony Kennedy (in a case that was otherwise about the contentious but rather dry issue of whether a criminal defendant's lawyer has to be in the room when the judge is hearing a prosecutor's explanation for using a peremptory challenge in jury selection) wrote a five-page concurrence that started by noting that the man in question had been held in solitary confinement for about 25 years (which as any lawyer will tell you is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand in that case), and went on to explain in great detail that solitary confinement is an issue the court should really, really, really, really want to consider, and came just short of begging someone, <em>anyone</em> to challenge solitary confinement so the court would have an opportunity to deal with it. Unlike Blackmun's opinion in <em>Flood</em>, Kennedy's concurrence was generally met with serious consideration, if not outright approval.
</li></ul></li><li> In Canadian court, one noted case was <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html">Meads v. Meads,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> 2012 ABQB 571, in which Justice J.D. Rooke ostensibly <em>could</em> have wrapped up the case in a neat bow with a few pages, but instead reached the breaking point and delivered, before the final verdict, a diatribe of <em>well</em> over a hundred pages, documenting what he calls 'OPCA ("organized pseudo-legal commercial argument") litigants'<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64p94');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note64p94" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64p94');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In other contexts, these may be more well-known as 'Sovereign Citizens' or 'Freemen on the Land'</span>, of whom the defendant was one. This wasn't intended merely as a diatribe against a growing flood of futile, annoying, and wasteful litigation; it was also designed to be a convenient compendium of commonly raised OPCA arguments and explanations of why they are (preposterously) wrong in law. The goal was to relieve counsel and other judges of the need to scour the jurisprudence for refutations of these arguments, as well as to provide a sort of very long explanatory pamphlet that can be given to self-represented litigants to dissuade them from trying to use OPCA strategies. As a result, the <em>Meads</em> decision has been used as precedent for many other cases, but some have noted that its confrontational and often dismissive tone has led to other Justices treating such cases more harshly than would otherwise be the case.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a> already delivers enough political messages in song or between songs. But in the Us + Them Tour, there's a whole 20 minute intermission with no one on stage (Waters and the band rest, the technicians ready both the flying pig and the elaborate recreation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals">Animals</a></em> factory) while the big screen shows messages of resistance against whoever Waters opposes.
