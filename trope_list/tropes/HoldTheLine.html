</p><p>A Hold the Line mission is a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a>, where instead of completing a mission in a set time, you have to prevent the enemy completing their objective before the time runs out. This usually means you are defending your base, or a certain character, until reinforcements arrive, or vital repairs are carried out on the base. Sometimes the enemy is an overwhelming force, so actually defeating the enemy, or even surviving much beyond the time limit, would be impossible, without reinforcements or similar. Fortunately for you, victory will usually occur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">instantly and automatically as soon as the time runs out</a>, even if you were moments away from defeat.

It also crops up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> games, most commonly as an objective-based multiplayer game mode, though stopping to defend against waves of enemies (most often by way of using mounted turrets with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">limitless ammo</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating">poor heat management</a>) is also a common occurrence.
</p><p>Sometimes it might be linked to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>, where the player has to escort someone to a location, and then protect them while they, for example, hack into the enemy's computer system.
</p><p>In multiplayer, this mode of gameplay also exists, usually with the teams switching after the attackers win or the timer runs out. In many cases, there are several lines, and the defining criteria (if neither team manages to break through them all) are usually which team got further or which team got to the same line first. Naturally this can result in tie games. Strategy games of all kinds love this trope — there are very, very few that do <em>not</em> have an example of a Hold The Line mission.

<ul><li> Starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldBadCompany">Battlefield: Bad Company</a></em>, the gamemode Rush involved one side protecting crates full of gold (later on they became M-COMS) while the attackers must take the objectives for themselves, pushing back defenders. With attackers the only ones given a limited amount of respawns, this makes "Hold the Line" the only goal for the defenders.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock">BioShock</a></em> franchise is all about this
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> requires the player to defend a Little Sister against waves of Splicers until she's done harvesting

One example is the lab defense sequence in Arcadia, where you have to fend off a Splicer assault while the Lazarus Vector is prepared for dispersal. Another is defending Little Sisters while they harvest Adam in the penultimate level of the game.
</li><li> The final "boss battle" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite">Bioshock Infinite</a></em> requires you to defend the power core on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Comstock's flagship</span> while using the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Booker-controlled Songbird</span> to destroy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the entire Vox Populi armada</span>.

<ul><li> One mission involves the player(s) holding off waves of bandits from destroying an electric generator while Tiny Tina hosts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">"tea party"</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">Flesh-Stick</a>.
</li><li> The "Bright Lights, Flying City" mission in ends with the player(s) having to defend a beacon in order to establish a fast-travel link to Sanctuary. You're doing this while Handsome Jack does everything he can to stop you, throwing endless Hyperion robots your way. It's one of the hardest missions in the game whether you're playing solo or in a group; the enemies are as relentless as they are numerous.
</li><li> One mission has you defending a Hyperion supply drop that landed in Slab bandit territory, with the help of some Slabs. In this case, there's a set number of enemies that Hyperion throws at you, but unlike in the above example (where you can repair the beacon if it's damaged and continue the mission), this mission is over if the supply drop takes just a few hits, and the last, most powerful enemies spawn just a few steps away from being able to hit it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms">Brothers in Arms</a></em> has quite a number of these.
<ul><li> <em>Road to Hill 30</em> has holding positions just outside of Carentan until American Sherman tanks from the 2nd Armored Division can arrive.
</li><li> Pretty much the entirety of <em>Hell's Highway</em> revolves around holding vital towns and areas of the titular highway against counterattacking German forces. It culminates in having to recapture and hold a vital train station from the 2nd SS Panzer Corps late in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 4</em> includes a mission called "One Shot, One Kill." You and a wounded partner attempt to defend a landing zone next to the famous Ferris wheel near Chernobyl.
<ul><li> Another example immediately follows in the same game as the player's squad running a small retreat action to hold a landing zone for extraction, hitting the seemingly infinite enemy forces as they fall back. After taking out <em>four</em> tanks (not bad for a special ops squad of six), they are then told that the LZ has been moved... to the area they've just let the enemy overrun, forcing the squad to go from Hold The Line to Attack The Line, breaking through the enemy's heavy defenses to make it to the LZ. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Gaz</a> was pissed. Widely considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel">Scrappy Level</a>, more so than "One Shot".
</li><li> In fact, there isn't a game in the <em>Call of Duty</em> series without at least a couple spots where you have to stop advancing and defend a position. Many of these follow a pattern: Get to the place you're defending, survive the infantry attacks until the enemies deploy armor and/or heavy weapons, then destroy the heavies to win the battle.
<ul><li> Or, in the case of levels like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Loose Ends</a>, get the hell out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Call of Duty 2</em>, in addition to a level actually <em>called</em> "Hold The Line", includes "Comrade Sniper", the second half of "The Silo", and "The Battle For Hill 400" (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/VideoGameLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/VideoGameLevels">crowning level of awesome</a>).
<ul><li> Call of Duty 1, had two shining examples of these, but they were both pretty hard. One was Pegasus Day, holding the bridge you'd taken the night before, using a fixed gun emplacement to rout enemy tanks. The second was the ever frustrating Pavlov's House mission.
</li><li> Before that is Dawnville, where you repel the Nazis from the village, only for them to retake the area a minute later, forcing you to "break through the line", complete with additional Tiger tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>2</em> had so many of these the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MedalOfHonor">Medal Of Honor</a></em> series is loaded with these kinds of objectives, such as defending the house in MOHAA's "Battle in the Bocage"(which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">called back to</a> in Brecourt Manor and Pointe du Hoc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 1</em> and <em>2</em>, respectively), "The Bridge", which is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission">Sniping Mission</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>, and the penultimate battle of <em>MoHAA: Spearhead</em>. In some levels you have to "Break the Line".
</li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> game has a fairly epic one where you and three other rangers defend a "house" (loosely used, since its more of a shell) that gradually gets more and more destroyed as time goes on until you are pretty much sitting in the open with mooks coming at you from all sides.
</li><li> The Demolition and Safeguard gamemodes in the Call of Duty multiplayer heavily run off this trope. In Demolition, the defense must protect two bombsites from destruction, while the offense attempts to destroy them. Much of the game revolves around the defense pinning the offense until one lucky saboteur sneaks through and plants a bomb, at which point it switches for the offense to hold the line until the bomb blows up. In Safeguard, the offense is tasked with escorting a non-combatant to the goal, while the defense uses every trick they have to prevent that from happening.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> has several of these as part of the story missions and strikes usually culminating in a named elite enemy.
<ul><li> Some of the public events are like this such as defending a crashed Warsat or preventing Vex from sacrificing themselves to a conflux (the difference being the objective of the first is to hold out and not die while the second is to kill the enemies before they reach their target)
</li><li> The Vault Of Glass raid has the initial defence of 3 control points from waves of enemies just to open the front door then several confluxes to defend further into the vault.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em> often did this with swarms of literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> (Trites and Ticks), such as when waiting for a ladder to drop down.

You just seized control of the Russian Ministries of Information and Defense, and now you're in what must be Red Square. You, along with a handful of fellow Western Coalition soldiers, must hold out against a <em>massive</em> Red Star counter attack.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> does this from time to time, with the player needing to protect Alyx (who is thankfully rather durable) as she completed some task or other. In <em>Half-Life 2: Episode One</em>, the developer's commentary at one point says that they specifically <em>didn't</em> include this sort of situation, because it just looked "robotic" to have her either just sit there and take the abuse from the Combine or zombies, or stop what she was doing to fight back and then start all over again.
<ul><li> ...but then they make a similar scenario into the final boss fight for <em>Half-Life 2: Episode Two.</em>
</li><li> Indeed, in Episode One, this occurs the other way round, with Alyx defending you.
</li><li> More importantly, the entire series is rife with elevators and teleporters that the player has to defend himself while waiting for.
</li><li> Any <em>HL2</em> player's hatred for the pesky turret guns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakTurretGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakTurretGun">fall over if you look at them wrong</a> will be raised to the power of itself after the level in Nova Prospekt, where they are hacked to be on your side and need to be used to keep the baddies at bay. The hacking does not improve their stability.

<ul><li> The multiplayer has a bunch of these for their objective games, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureTheFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureTheFlag">Capture the Flag</a>, which is what you think it is; Assault, which involves one team trying to bomb the other; Land Grab/Territories, which fits this trope to a tee as it involves holding parts of the map to stop the other team from capturing it; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Warzone Assault</a>, where one team has to defend its bases from taken by the other one.
</li><li> The single player campaigns have several examples of this too; for example, parts of the second and third missions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, the last part of "Sacred Icon" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, defending the Outpost in "Winter Contingency" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, waiting for the elevator in "Exodus" in <em>Reach</em>, and defending the Package in the eponymous mission from (again) <em>Reach</em>.

Of course, they also activate skulls as you complete rounds and sets. Getting one of the seven Vidmaster achievements (you need all seven to unlock the Recon armor for multiplayer matches in <em>Halo 3</em>) requires a four player team to finish the fourth set on Heroic difficulty (which is easier than the first version, which required getting though the seventh set on Legendary. Good thing it was changed before release). A Firefight game ends in one of two ways: Everybody leaves, or everybody dies (or someone without a 360 hard drive, which is needed to play co-op, joins the game and causes it to abort). Later games' Firefight modes are similar, except you actually <em>can</em> win.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic">Team Fortress Classic</a></em> has a mode where one team try to defend all their control points in the map while the other team try to capture all of them, with a flag being required to capture it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealIITheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealIITheAwakening">Unreal II: The Awakening</a></em> has two missions where the objective is to hold off Skaarj invasions until an evacuation ship comes to your aid or your ship is fully repaired. Another mission requires you to defend a (very annoying) scientist during some time from Liandri assassins.
</li><li> The Assault gametype in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament">Unreal Tournament</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> reenact 'historic' battles while each team trades off attacking and defending sides. The first attacking team can get a serious advantage if performing well in their round, since as defenders they only have to hold the line for the amount of time their victory took.
</li><li> <em>2004</em> (and <em>2003</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Epic Bonus Pack</a>) feature the Invasion gametype, which pits you and the rest of the players, grouped as a team, against several monsters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealI">Unreal</a></em>. You have to survive up to 16 waves if you want to win, though that's easier said than done.

A team with control of a Leviathan, and a coordinated defense, can simply count frags until the clock runs out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Verdun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Verdun">Verdun</a></em> is all about this.

A massive dragon is marching down the titular Steps of Faith, with numerous smaller dragons supporting it. The goal of the trial is to stop the dragon from breaking through the lines of defense. This is a unique trial in that it's one of the few (if not the only) ones a fallen character can respawn in without having to be raised by another player, and its one of the few (again, if not the only) ones where you can outright fail the trial if the dragon breaks through the last line of defense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> loves this trope both in missions and challenges. Two that immediately spring to mind are the Factions mission "Arborstone" where the player must defend a character who is casting a spell to open a door, and the Prophecies mission "Sanctum Cay", where players must hold off waves of bad guys on a beach as a mage stands on a pier summoning a magical ship so that the party can escape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi">Mabinogi</a></em> holds two Shadow Missions (Missions taking place in the dark and foreboding Shadow Realm, a copy of the real world) that invoke this trope. The first is a mission where the party must assist other NPCs in battling Shadow Monsters while a scout is rescued off camera. If any NPCs die, the mission fails (but players can heal them, and taking out the Archers that can deal permanent HP damage first increases your chances of success tenfold). The second is called Tailltean Defensive Battle, and requires a party of 3-6 players to split up and defend the city's three gates from wave after wave of monsters for about 16 real world minutes. If too many monsters spawn, or they break the gate controls at any one gate, mission failed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> goes in this direction when you fight certain gigantic monsters, namely the huge crab Shen Gaoren, and the even bigger dragon Lao-Shan Lung. Instead of hunting them like you do with other monsters, the creature shows up at one end of a linear area, and past multiple obstacles is a fort on the other end of the map. You have to prevent it from destroying the fort, by either killing it before the timer runs out, or repelling it by dealing enough damage that when the timer hits 0, it flees. If you run out of time before damaging the monster enough, get knocked out three times, or let the fort get destroyed, you lose.
<ul><li> The Jhen Mohran fight in <em>Tri</em> is a two-parter. The first involves chasing and causing whatever damage you can to it on your Dragonship, and the second is this trope. Again, if you clock out before hitting the "repel" damage threshold, you expire your faint tally, or the Dragonship is destroyed, you fail. It's possible, however unlikely, that the Dragonship will be wrecked on the first phase; hope your team isn't that sloppy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2">Phantasy Star Online 2</a></em> has a series of "Base Defense" emergency missions which task players with protecting a series of towers from increasingly powerful and aggressive Darker hoards. To better protect the base, players can collect Photon crystals to repair damage to the towers, erect barriers that can freeze nearby Darkers in place for a few moments, or summon a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG-toting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>.

The time-travel dungeon Black Morass and the magic prison known as the Violet Hold both are Hold The Line missions, while other dungeons have segments that work this way. Not to forget the latest PvP additions, Strand of the Ancients and Lake Wintergrasp. In both cases, one side defends a keep against the other, but the previous one is played in two rounds, swapping the roles much like in the FPS mode it's rather obviously inspired by.
<ul><li> In a very straight example of the escort mission followed by protecting your charge while he hacks into a computer variant, the Halls of Stone instance has you escort Brann Bronzebeard to the Titan mainframe and defend him from waves of mobs that attack as part of the security system while he tries to break through it.

</li><li> The Quartz Quadrant boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD">Sonic CD</a></em> will automatically defeat itself once enough time has passed from when Sonic enters its chamber (which is about 2 minutes). There's no onscreen countdown timer, however. Rather, the conveyor belt Sonic runs on slowly grinds down the floor beneath Dr. Eggman, and once the floor becomes too thin, Eggman flees and stops the conveyor belt, allowing Sonic to proceed.

A floating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleTops">bladed spinning top</a> floats around the battlefield. The boss will open up if hit by the top and then take damage once hit by it again. However, unlike most other cases of holding the line, Sonic can speed up the battle by opening it up himself, though he will still need to make it attack itself.

Once you begin, a transmission to let the scattered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">Spire</a> fleets regroup into a coherent fighting force in your area of the galaxy is initiated... one the AI is perfectly aware of. And it reacts appropriately by sending an utterly <em>cataclysmic</em> fleet pouring out of every nearby Warp Gate in order to crush you as fast as possible before they can arrive. Thus, before you begin, you must fortify every route, and the whole path to your homeworld, so that you can hold these tens and hundreds of thousands of ships at bay (with some giant Extragalactic War ships thrown in for flavor). This is naturally not easy; even at low Response Intensity the attack is bigger than anything you usually face in normal gameplay, and at high Intensity you can easily get 50+ thousand Strength pouring out into individual planets, with more trailing behind. You <em>will</em> lose multiple planets to this onslaught, and will very likely need to fend them off at the gates of your Homeworld. But if you hold out, the Imperial Spire will arrive with an even <em>bigger</em> fleet full of some of the strongest vessels in the game, and start stomping on everything the AI has at last.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard</a></em> has invoked this trope so many times in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarCraft">War Craft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> series and grown wiser so many times that most missions of this kind fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> in harder difficulties.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em> has <strike> four</strike> five of these missions during the "Reign Of Chaos" campaign missions.
<ul><li> The first time against an upset sea witch in the extended version of the tutorial. The Orcs had to hold the line against a horde of Murlocks while their ships were being fixed.
</li><li> The 5th Alliance mission has defending a town for 30 minutes against the Undead until your allies arrive.
</li><li> The last Undead mission has you defending Kel'Thuzad for 30 minutes as he completes a ritual to summon Archimonde and the Burning Legion.
</li><li> The final Night Elf mission pits you and your allies against the Burning Legion for 45 minutes to let Malfurion complete his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li><li> Some fan maps are centered about this trope, often with two teams of players trying to hold out as long as possible while trying to sabotage the other teams efforts (and in some cases, summoning the enemies). One lesser known map of this type goes by the exact name of this trope.
</li><li> The secret mission in <em>The Frozen Throne</em> involves a Tower Defense mini-game where you hold off up to forty-five waves of increasingly dangerous enemies with increasingly powerful towers; if you succeed, you get a special bonus hero in the next mission.
</li><li> The first Scourge mission in <em>The Frozen Throne</em> uses an inversion of the trope. You are keeping your opponents from <em>escaping</em> while you hunt down and destroy their bases of operation. If twenty or more humans escape, you lose.
</li><li> Another inversion is in the second-to-last Night Elf mission in <em>The Frozen Throne</em>, where the Naga try to hold the line for 30 minutes until Illidan's spell is completed, and your task is to break the line and thwart them.
</li><li> And it's even apparent in cutscenes. In the Frozen Throne Night Elf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>, Tyrande attempted to hold the bridge against the Undead forces using her Ultimate, only to have the said bridge collapse (Which was actually intentional).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft I</a></em> had you defend a Terran base against a Zerg rush as the third mission. Being the third mission, your opponent isn't as well defended as expected, and a good player can wipe them off the map before the time runs out, instead of defending. Some lines removed from the final version suggested that was the intention.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novel <em>Speed of Darkness</em> justifies the apparent lack of enemies. A group of Confederate Marines fought a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> in another area of Mar Sara at the same time that you were fighting the third mission, diverting mass quantities of Zerg away from you.
</li><li> The fourth Zerg mission in the original campaign has you repel Terran forces for 15 minutes until the chrysalis opens. Once Kerrigan comes out, it reverts to a regular mission.
</li><li> Like in the <em>Frozen Throne</em> example, the third-to-last Zerg mission plays with this. The two Protoss bases are trying to have Dark Templar try to escape through clearly-marked beacons (If one escapes, you lose), and you have to destroy said bases. However, the beacons have to remain guarded, so you need to hold the line against particular units while launching attacks.
</li><li> The second-to-last original Zerg mission fits this trope, holding off a Protoss attack as you harvest from the Khaydarin Crystal Formation. The crystal formation is in the middle of three different Protoss tribes, each fully equipped with Carriers, Reavers and High Templars. You have to hold your base at the formation for <em>ten minutes</em>. That is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">unless you only send a drone to the crystals AFTER you destroy the Protoss bases, in which it's just waiting until the timer runs out</a>.
</li><li> The final mission in Brood War's Protoss campaign is a version of this: you have to get your two hero units to a structure, then they go inside it, then you have to defend that structure until the task is complete. Like the Zerg mission above, this is rather easy to bypass by taking out the Zerg bases one at a time before starting the countdown. Doing so however, is a challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> has several of these missions spanning across its three games.
<ul><li> The third mission in <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, "Ground Zero", is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the first game's third Terran mission, up to the point the battle happens in the same place. The Zerg bases are similarly lightly defended, and wiping them out nets you an achievement. Unlike the original mission, the Zerg get reinforced, so even if you destroy their base you'll still need to hold out against a final assault.
</li><li> One of the artifact missions in <em>Wings of Liberty</em> is "The Dig". You have to defend the Drakken Laser Drill until it destroys the gates of a Xel'Naga temple. The drill can actually help you destroy the strongest Protoss units if you desire... but doing so will make the mission last longer. After all, if the drill is destroying enemy units it isn't breaching the temple gates. You can also go on the offensive and completely destroy the Protoss force (using the drill helps) which actually automatically wins the mission. Presumably, the in-universe explanation is that with the threat over, the Raiders could use the drill open the temple at their leisure. Waiting for the mission to end with nothing to do however would be <em>very</em> boring, so the missions then just ends.
</li><li> The final mission in the Protoss mini-campaign, "In Utter Darkness", subverts this trope. The objective in this mission is killing as many Zerg <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Hybrid</span> units as possible, and defending an archive during the first 15 minutes (Then it becomes invulnerable and grants research points). The subversion comes from the fact the mission always ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">your forces being wiped out, but it's a success if you killed as many units as the main objective said</a>.
</li><li> <em>Wings of Liberty</em>'s campaign mode closes with "All In". You have to defend an artifact for 30 minutes against endless Zerg forces (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Kerrigan</a> that comes up from time to time). The artifact actually helps in that once in some minutes it can wipe out almost all Zerg units near you, but an achievement needs you to not use it more than once... Attacking the enemy bases is impractical at best (you're better off keeping your forces for defense), and the bases are quickly rebuilt rendering it pointless.
</li><li> <em>Heart of the Swarm</em> only has one mission that fits this trope, with it being "The Crucible", in which you have to hold out primal zerg forces for 30 minutes until Kerrigan hatches from her chrysalis. In this mission and all subsequent hold the line missions, the enemy has no base to destroy meaning defense <em>really is</em> your only option.
</li><li> The first mission in <em>Legacy of the Void</em>'s prologue campaign plays with this trope. Your Protoss forces have to destroy stasis chambers in which other Protoss are held in by the Moebius Corps, who are holding the line... but Kerrigan's Swarm arrives at full power to raze the entire facility, so your objective is to destroy the stasis chambers before the Moebius Corps cannot hold the line any longer.
</li><li> The first mission in <em>Legacy of the Void</em> in this trope style is "Last Stand" - protecting the Xel'Naga temple on Shakuras until you destroy three pillars and the Zerg counter reaches 1 billion. Unlike other examples, after the counter reaches said mark, the mission does not end, and it only does so when <em>you</em> decide to overload the temple - a bonus objective requires you to hold out until 1.5 billion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0z3vy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0z3vy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0z3vy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, you hold out until your forces can extract the solarite beneath the temple, this is simply marked as 1.5 billion for conveniences sake</span> and an achievement asks you to reach 1.8 billion, which are easier said than done.
</li><li> The final mission in <em>Legacy of the Void</em>'s main campaign, "Salvation", is very similar in concept to "All In" and map style to "In Utter Darkness" from <em>Wings of Liberty</em>. You (And your allies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">and their weak defenses</a>) have to defend the Keystone until it's fully charged against Zerg and Protoss forces. Vorazun and Karax even mention the trope in some of their lines.
</li><li> The epilogue campaign has its Terran mission, "Essence of Eternity", as one. You have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">protect Kerrigan</a> until she ascends to a Xel'naga in a similar way to "The Dig", except with much stronger attacks, and just like in "Salvation", you have allies that simply cannot set up an effective defense.

If you got lucky or were good at micromanagement, it was actually possible to push the enemy back and even destroy their base. However... because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>, this was not an instant win, and instead caused the game to spawn <em>two dozen Mammoth Tanks</em> at the edges of the map, presumably as punishment for your insolence. This grim spectre descending on your base would have been devastating... were it not for the fact that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">so [dang] slow</a> that the timer ran out before they could get there.

The catch was that thanks to low power, only a few of your defense buildings could be working at one time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>: In Winter Assault, the Imperial Guard must prevent the ork Waaagh! from overrunning their base and the Eldar they're protecting until reinforcements arrive. Said reinforcements consists of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Baneblade</a>, eliminating the orks <em>very</em> quickly.
<ul><li> Stronghold missions in Dark Crusade and Soulstorm are essentially the player pulling this trope against the computer.
</li><li> Inverted in Soulstorm: the Tau stronghold has a reinforcement fleet coming in, guided by three beacons, with each beacon destroyed delaying their arrival further. Unlike most examples, letting the countdown reach zero doesn't make it that much harder.

<ul><li> The end of Mission 1, "First Contact" has you hold a resource point from aliens. It's extremely simple and serves more of a tutorial mission.
</li><li> The end of Mission 2, "Distress Call" has you hold a resource point from a neverending stream of aliens until the timer runs up. Thankfully, you have a Drop Turret to help you whittle down the enemies.
</li><li> Once you capture the three main bases and generators in Mission 4, "Unto the Breach", you will need to defend all three from alien attack for 2 minutes so that they can power up a cannon and destroy the lot.
</li><li> The Special Ops Mission "Uninvited Guests" requires that you prevent the aliens from reaching the teleporter in the center. You need to defend for three waves, and the mission is failed if more than six aliens touch the teleporter in the center.
</li><li> The Special Ops Mission "Emergency Frequency" requires that you prevent a massive incoming stream of aliens from destroying your main base at the other side of the map.
</li><li> The Special Ops Mission "Darkest Hour" requires that you defend the soldiers in three different areas from alien attack, until each group is able to teleport away. Made more difficult as the only unit you have deployed is your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Unit</a>, but easier by the fact that your drop turret's recharge time is greatly increased.
</li><li> The Special Ops Mission "In Brightest Day" requires that you defend two power cores near the center of the map from enemies attacking from multiple directions. Fortunately, you have some defenses set up as well as troops deployed to assist you.
</li><li> Mission 9, "Eye Contact" has you capture and hack an enemy defense system, before having to defend it from unending streams of incoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> for 7 minutes.
</li><li> Mission 12, "Overclocking" requires that you defend your main base at one end of the zone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> arriving from other areas of the zone for 10 minutes. You'll need to defend the consoles around the area too, because if the robots reach them, they'll open up bridges that grant them easier access to your main base. For the first 5 minutes, things are relatively simple, but the next 5 minutes makes things more dicey when the enemies start spawning from an area that's very close to your main base.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleForMiddleEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleForMiddleEarth">The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth</a></em> series is filled with missions of this type. Two classic examples are Helm's Deep and the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Somewhat subverted in that trying to hold your ground on the walls at Helm's Deep like they did in the movies is actually the <em>worst possible strategy you can use</em>. Sallie parties of cavalry can easily wipe out the enemy attack waves before they even make it to the walls and your relatively pathetic infantry.
<ul><li> <em>The Battle for Middle-Earth 2</em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, <em>The Rise of the Witch-king</em>, have missions like this also. The vanilla <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFME2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFME2">BFME 2</a> has missions of this type in Rivendell, Mithlond (the Grey Havens), and Erebor. In the Rivendell mission, you help Elrond repel a goblin attack force (since this is the first mission of the campaign, this is easier than it sounds).

</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em> games have penultimate bosses that are huge, walk around slowly, and in most cases fall under this; they cannot be harmed by your weapons, only waited out until they self-destruct. This is highly averted in some home releases such as <em>V</em> where you must shoot them.
<ul><li> And the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Cube Rush</a> in <em>Gradius III Arcade</em>'s Crystal stage. The first game also did this with waves of a certain type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> before each fight with the Big Core.

There is a twist—enemies will attack your engines, which makes the counter slow down and, if they reach critical condition, stop completely, so you've got to keep them repaired. The final stage, "Into the Breach", averts it by counting <em>up</em> instead of down for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame">survival mode</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker">Hellsinker</a></em> has several bosses that must be defeated by time-out:
<ul><li> In Segment 5, if you unlock Perpetual Calendar's true form, it will only be destroyed once time runs out. You can, however, "kill" it repeatedly for Terra boosts, unless you've already run out of Terra.
</li><li> Rex Cavalier in Segment 7 plays this trope straight at first, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">inverts it</a> when the first timer runs out.
</li><li> Lost Property 771, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, can only be defeated via time-out.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissileCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissileCommand">Missile Command</a></em> could be considered an early example (1980), since you can never actually destroy any of the unseen enemies launching the enemy missiles at you.
<ul><li> Many classic, endless arcade games were like this; whatever enemy force you're up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KobayashiMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KobayashiMario">never ends</a>, so all you can do is hold it off as long as possible and aim for a high score.
</li></ul></li><li> The final bosses of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a></em> disable your weapons and force you to survive their attacks for 60 seconds.
</li><li> Similarly, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType">R-Type</a> Delta</em> is immune to your weapons; the only way to beat it is survive until your Dose (effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb">Smart Bomb</a>) meter slowly fills to max. The resulting blast is the only way to kill the boss.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType">R-Type</a> FINAL</em> has a tangentially-related gimmick for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">one of the final bosses</a>; the only thing that can kill it is a fully-charged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> shot, but it's broken and requires about 45 seconds of dodging the boss' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> to sufficiently charge.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> is probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em> where the game is instantly over if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.
</li><li> In the final stage of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> game <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em>, you have to survive the true spirit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Yuyuko</a>, who is indestructible. This is repeated when you fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Kaguya and Eirin</a>, or just Kaguya, in <em>Imperishable Night</em>. If you faced Kaguya, then once you reach this stage, you've already won.
<ul><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">extra stage bosses</a> have similar attacks as either their penultimate or finishing spell cards.
</li><li> There are a lot of these; the fandom likes to call them Survival Cards. EX-bosses and final bosses tend to have them the most often, although Stage 4 bosses Aya (Mountain of Faith) and Murasa (Undefined Fantastic Object) have one each to compensate for the fact that they have a fixed spell lineup rather than a variable one, which was customary until then.
</li><li> What tops the cake, however, is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">the whole game can be played like this.</a> Each and every spellcard, and every nonspell pattern has a timer. Once the timer runs out, that portion of the boss's lifebar is defeated, regardless of how much damage they've taken. You can very well defeat a boss without firing a single shot. (however, some bosses intentionally ratchet up the difficulty of the pattern an insane amount on the final few seconds, mostly on patterns that is supposed to gradually get harder as the boss's HP is depleted, to prevent a cheesy win)

Each of these missions have a twist.
<ul><li> Defense alerts make you protect a defenseless artifact for a certain number of waves (between 10 and 20). A wave is defeated when all the enemies in it are dead. Infestation invasions are similar, except that the enemy are a Zerg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>.
</li><li> Survival Alerts have you kill enemies to loot Life Support modules from them to extend the time you can survive, each enemy killed having a chance to drop life support, and each life support module giving you roughly 7 seconds of time. You start with 150 seconds, and can never go above that. Regularly, big life support capsules are delivered by your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, giving you 45 seconds of survival once activated. You must last 10, 15, or 20 minutes. The twist is, reaching the benchmark is not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a> like in most games: you must reach extraction for it to count as a win (if playing in a group, at least 1 person must reach extraction alive to give completion rewards to all the group).
</li><li> Excavation alerts have you go to locations where extractors are extracting a resource called Cryotic. They start with 50 seconds worth of power, and need 100 seconds to finish their jobs. Each second they stay active (up until 100) gives you 1 cryotic. You can give them power cells (looted from enemies) give them 20 extra seconds. When you have extracted 500 cryotics... You don't get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>, you have to reach the extraction point. The enemies will attack the extractors though, so you have to defend them.
</li><li> Regular Defense have you protecting a defenseless artifact. There are 3 pools of rewards (A, B and C). killing 5 waves gives you a random reward from pool A, and you have a choice as whether to extract (and keep the rewards) or keep fighting (risking the rewards you already had for more). After wave 10, you gain another reward from pool A, and you get to choose wether to extract or stay. 15 waves, one reward from pool B and another choice of staying vs extracting. 20 waves, a reward from pool C, and another choice between extraction and battle. Then the cycle repeats: 25 waves, and a third A reward.
</li><li> Mobile Defense mission have you carry a datamass to hack terminals. Hacking each terminal takes anywhere between 1 and 3 minutes, but the enemy would rather destroy the terminals than let you get away with the data, so you have to protect them.
</li><li> Regular excavation follow an AABC cycle of rewards similar to defense, only you have to protect extractors for 100 seconds of activation to get rewards, and they still start at 50 seconds and thus need at least 3 power cells to get you rewards.
</li><li> And lastly, regular Survival have you survive as long as you can like survival alerts, only they have an AABC cycle of rewards for every 5 minutes you manage to survive.

His goal is to survive long enough for the slimes to get bored and retreat. On the fifth turn, reinforcements arrive bearing weapons that can kill most of the slimes easily.
</li><li> All battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest">Pokémon Conquest</a></em> require the attacking side to complete the objective within a set turn limit, otherwise they lose. For the ones <em>being</em> attacked, playing defensively to wait out the timer can be an effective strategy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prismata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prismata">Prismata</a></em> draws inspiration from Real time strategy, so it's fitting that one of the early missions requires you to build walls and defend against swarms of attackers.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rebuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rebuild">Rebuild</a></em> series has the survivors do this every night (roughly) against the hordes of zombies surrounding them. Several of the endings have massive hordes show up every night until the objective is completed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> titles occasionally have missions where the player must prevent enemies from crossing a line or entering a base. Said base may or may not have its own completely useless garrison. One example is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment">Super Robot Wars Judgment</a></em> mission with the player defending a city while it's being evacuated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildermyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildermyth">Wildermyth</a></em> features periodic incursions by enemy forces. The win condition of an incursion battle is always to survive a set number of turns; though it's possible to win sooner by defeating all enemy units, it's not required. The player has the opportunity to add defensive features to an area in advance of an incursion, such as barricades and traps, to make holding the line for the required number of turns that much easier.

<ul><li> The entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM: UFO Defense</a></em> is a Hold The Line mission. Every alien ship and base the player destroys only serves to hinder the aliens' progress until the player has the knowledge and technology to attack the alien home base. No matter how many weapons the player builds and no matter how many aliens he successfully destroys, the Earth will slowly but surely fall into alien hands unless the final mission is carried out.
<ul><li> This is mostly true for most of the games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM">XCOM</a></em> series and even lots of those inspired by it.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse">Apocalypse</a></em>, you actually take the fight to the enemy after a while (however, mostly you'll be holding the line at home while you carry out covops-style missions in the alien dimension. And the only way to actually win is to destroy the one last buildings the aliens have — and you can't skip buildings). In <em>X-COM: Interceptor</em> you are delaying the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">construction of a planet destroyer weapon designed to eliminate Earth (which is out of reach for the player)</span>. In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOExtraterrestrials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOExtraterrestrials">UFO Extraterrestrials</a></em>, you are holding the line to prevent the alien mothership <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is parked near Earth (the game itself is set on a far away colony of Esperanza) from refuelling after being attacked by Earths <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a></span>.

The first is a standard covert operative extraction where you have to protect transmitter and encoder from the EXALT organization. You basically end up fighting a running battle as EXALT troops swarm the objective area and try to hack the encoder and destroy the transmitter.

The first is a standard "Protect Device" mission, where the player must keep a device from being destroyed by aliens within a set amount of turns. The other is "Avenger Defense", which can result from a Dark Event that sees a UFO ground XCOM's flying fortress. In this mission, players must destroy the device preventing the Avenger's escape, then get back to the ship, all the while keeping enemies from entering the ship. Unlike the other examples, there is no time limit.

<ul><li> This is drawn from the Battle of Rynn's World, the Crimson Fists' homeworld; while under siege from an ork WAAAGH!!!, a catastrophic failure by an anti-ship missile caused their fortress and most of the Chapter to get nuked into oblivion. Kantor rallied the survivors (exact numbers aren't stated, but it was anywhere from two hundred to <em>sixteen</em> Space Marines, out of a thousand-strong Chapter) and managed to hold for eighteen months against millions of orks before Imperial reinforcements arrived to drive off the Greenskins.

<ul><li> In the deep lore of 40k there was Ollanius Pius. A regular old human Imperial Guardsman who was accidentally teleported onto the Chaos flagship at the end of the Horus Heresy, who not only managed to avoid being killed immediately, but then stood up to the superhuman, power armour clad, chaos warped Primarch Horus, after Horus had knocked The Emperor to the floor in combat. Pius held the line as the Emperor tried to regain his sense, and was soul flayed with a glance. He did no damage to Horus, but it allowed the Emperor to realise there was truly no hope left for Horus to regain his humanity, and The Emperor rose again and defeated the heretical traitor. As is usual for Games Workshop, they couldn't help but ruin something and destroy it's meaning, as they continued to muck around with this piece of lore, making them a Space Marine Terminator, a member of the elite Custodes, and also turning Pius into a special immortal being.

It should be noted that the Spartans technically failed in their objective and were overrun too quickly because the Persians were able to get behind their formation by sending some men through a narrow mountain pass. Ironically, this partial failure may have saved Greece as the flight was mostly there to prevent a beach landing. The Greek fleet disengaged as they had no reason to stay when the Spartans fell and later defeated the Persian fleet instead of sacrificing themselves for the sake of the Spartans.

</li><li> During the First Crusade, in a rare moment of genuine heroism by the Crusaders who had otherwise been rather distinctly <em>unheroic</em> for much of that fiasco; there came the Battle of Dorylaeum, where the Crusaders under the command of Bohemond of Taranto held a shield wall formation that protected numerous noncombatants for nearly <em>seven hours</em> against the Turkish onslaught led by Kilij Arslan I, in full armor under the burning Middle Eastern sun in a marshy riverbank. The Crusaders then managed to win the battle after reinforcements arrived allowing the defense to rally.
</li><li> Wellington held the line against Napoleon at Waterloo until Blucher could arrive with the other half of the Allied army. Had Grouchy marched to the sound of the guns, he might have brought enough troops to break that line.
<ul><li> To gain enough time to reach Waterloo without interference, Blucher left behind his III Corps, under command of general von Thielmann (with none else than Clausewitz as his chief of staff). Grouchy eventually managed to force the Prussian III Corps out of the way... <em>The day after Waterloo</em>, just in time for Blucher's triumphant army to arrive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">cause Grouchy's retreat to not be wiped out</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Thin Red Line" at the Battle of Balaclava, 1854. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">93rd</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Highlander</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">Regiment</a> in a two-man deep firing line successfully routed a Russian cavalry charge, saving the vulnerable British camp in the process. Something of a subversion, in that it only worked because the Russian commander saw the tiny defense force, concluded they were bait for an ambush, and ordered the withdrawal before his charge connected.
</li><li> The Mexican victory at Puebla on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CincoDeMayo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CincoDeMayo">Cinco de Mayo</a> during France's invasion in the 1860s delayed the French advance on Mexico City for over a year. This gave Mexican President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNative">Benito</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Juarez</a> time to organize a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile">Government in Exile</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> before fleeing, it also prevented the French from linking up with the Confederates in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a> and gave the Union time to turn the tables on the Confederates.
</li><li> At the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, the 20th Maine, which held the far left end of the Union line on the second day of battle, was nearly overwhelmed by Confederate forces attempting to flank the formation and break through to the Union rear area. Colonel Joushua Lawrence Chamberlin, the 20th's commanding officer, ordered his men to increase their spacing to extend his position, "refuse the line" (draw back at a right angle to the existing formation), and hold position. After enduring multiple waves of oncoming Confederate soldiers, and with nearly the entire unit either dead, injured, or out of ammunition, Chamberlin ordered his men to meet the final assault with a bayonet charge. The tactic caught the Confederate forces off guard, and broke their momentum, saving the Union flank.
<ul><li> A less celebrated but even more notable example was on the Union right, where Union troops held on to Culp's Hill<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3stdh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3stdh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3stdh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is the hill Trimble is venting about to Lee in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a></em></span> with their fingernails against one after another attempt by the Confederates to dislodge them. <em>For three days.</em> With the most significant action finding a heavily outnumbered brigade of the Union XII Corps facing three brigades of Allegheny Johnson's division of Ewell's corps during the night of the second day.
</li></ul></li><li> The Battle of Rorke's Drift was an example - although only the Zulu commander knew this at the time. Having been ordered to join up with the main Zulu army there was only so long he could spend trying to wipe out the British garrison.
</li><li> During the Soviet-Afghan War, an army of 39 Soviet paratroopers held a defensive position on Hill 3234 against an army of 200 to 400 Mujahideen and Pakistan soldiers, allowing a caravan to pass on the nearby road.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. After the Germans used gas for the first time the French colonial units in position broke and ran leaving a 7 kilometer wide hole in the line. Before the Germans could take advantage, the Canadian First Division (responsible for defending a front a few hundred meters wide) along with some scattered French troops spread out to plug the breach, holding the line for a critical 48 hours in hastily thrown up defenses until reinforcements could be brought up. One in three of the Canadians were wounded or killed.
<ul><li> In fact, this is what WWI was in general, especially the Western Front — two sides, dug in, holding the line against each other. With the addition of machine guns and chemical weapons like chlorine and mustard gas, the end result was an unendingly bloody meat grinder. (And yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> surpassed it on so many levels as to defy imagining.)
</li></ul></li><li> Comes up a lot in British military history, actually. The early years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> effectively had the entire country doing this.
<div class="indent"><em>"We will stand and fight here. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">If we can't stay here alive, then let us stay here</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">dead</a><em>."</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gz8j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4gz8j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gz8j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A quote from Field Marshal Montgomery's speech upon taking command of the 8th Army</span>
</div><ul><li> Particularly at the evacuation from Dunkirk. Recognizing that their situation was untenable, but to ensure that the British could live to fight another day, the French forces covered the evacuations until much (though sadly not all) of the BEF were safely off the continent. Once they were, the French were evacuated as well, forming the core of what would become the Free French forces.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Battle of Berlin</a>, Walther Wenck, along with the 12th Army, opened a corridor for German civilians and the remnants of the 9th Army to escape the Soviet army and retreat to the Western-occupied territories.
</li><li> The early months of the Korean War (June and July 1950) went excellently for North Korea, taking over most of the southern part of the peninsula and pushing the UN force (mostly South Korean, US, and some Commonwealth troops) into a 140-mile defensive perimeter around the last major port outside the control of the Korean People's Army - Busan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName">(then Romanized as Pusan)</a>. For about six weeks the KPA continued to try to break through the Pusan Perimeter to capture the city; the US-led force pushed to hold them off while ground forces from Japan could be ferried over to build up their troop strength. Eventually, the KPA were forced to retreat due to hampered supply lines needing to come all the way from the north, especially after the UN launched a successful amphibious landing behind their lines at Incheon on September 15.
</li><li> During the 1527 Sack of Rome, the Swiss Guard held off the invading Holy Roman Empire long enough for the Pope to escape the city.
</li><li> Non-military example: defensive stops in American football by a team holding a lead of 4 to 8 points (a deficit that could be overcome or leveled with a touchdown but not a field goal) near the end of the game. If they can just prevent the offense from gaining the first-down line (or for more drama, the goal line if the offense gets that close) until four downs or the clock runs out...
<ul><li> In a more ordinary example, "pass blocking" is this. As opposed to "run blocking," where the intent to usually to "attack" defensive players and push them back and/or out of the way of the ball carrier, in pass blocking, offensive linemen, and possibly the RB if he's not running a route, let the defense rush at them, and try to stop them or steer them aside and form a "pocket" (basically the line they're holding) where the QB can make a throw unmolested. Given that pass rushers are usually similar in size and strength to offensive linemen, and blockers aren't allowed to "hold" (grab on to opponents' jerseys, though players can get away with mild/subtle holding) rushers or to "chop block" (hit below the waist of a rusher that is already "engaged" with another blocker) them, among other things, this is a very temporary measure. The QB is therefore expected to make a throw (or at least buy blockers time by running away from pressure) quickly, to cut the linemen some slack.
</li></ul></li><li> The battle for Castle Itter, in what is the only battle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> where the Wehrmacht and the US Army were fighting on the same side. When a castle in Austria was taken by the combination of Josef Gangl's German and John C. Lee's American forces, the SS were intent on reclaiming it, forcing the two (in addition to the prisoners) to make every attempt to fight off the SS until backup arrived.
</li><li> The Italian front of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> in a nutshell:
<ul><li> As Italy joined the war, the Austro-Hungarian militia on the border territory had to do everything in their power to hold off the Italians until the arrival of reinforcements from the Eastern Front. Due Italian troubles, they succeeded;
</li><li> After the first few weeks, both sides engaged in this: Austria-Hungary, having the advantages of the high ground on the mountainous border, battle-hardened troops fighting mostly unexperienced soldiers and initially superior equipment, was to hold the line until they had a chance for an offensive against Brescia (where most of Italy's weapons and munitions were made) and Venice, while Italian commander-in-chief Luigi Cadorna, having entered the war with an underequipped force due <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">incompetence from the bureaucrats</a> and most of his predecessors and before having the time to even <em>start</em> to mobilize the army (why he didn't launch an offensive on Trento and then Vienna while most of the Austro-Hungarian army was out of position), planned since the start to use the static nature of trench warfare to sap the enemy strength while the Italian industry produced the necessary weapons, the Italian army mobilized, and, hopefully, the Russian army broke through. Had it not been for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">unexpected events</a> allowing the Austro-Hungarian army and German reinforcements to throw all their strength on the Italian Front, Cadorna's strategy would have succeeded.
</li><li> In 1916 Austria-Hungary launched the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asiago">Punitive Expedition<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> against Asiago, planning to break through and attack Brescia, resulting in the Italian First Army and the newly-formed Fifth Army having to hold the line waiting for the Russians taking advantage of the enemy moving troops from their front to Italy to launch their attack-and then the Austro-Hungarians had to hold the line on both fronts, as the Russians and the Italians coordinated their offensives.
</li><li> After the Austro-Hungarian victory at Caporetto, the Italian Fourth Army was ordered to hold the line at the Grappa Massif and other troops to perform a delaying action on the Piave river to both protect Venice and Brescia and give time to French and British reinforcements to deploy on the Mincio river. Much to everyone's surprise, the Fourth Army not only held the line, but inflicted the enemy such a beating that the line stabilized on the Piave.
</li><li> In summer 1918 the Austro-Hungarians launched their final offensive on the Piave river, with the Italian troops successfully holding the line until the Austro-Hungarians exhausted their supplies.
</li><li> As the above happened, the Entente forces in the Adriatic sea, later reinforced by the Italian navy, had established the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otranto_Barrage">Otranto Barrage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to keep the Austro-Hungarian fleet from breaking into the Mediterranean and threaten their operations there, and had to take the brunt of multiple assaults.
</li><li> At the same time, the Italian garrisons on the Lybian coast had to hold against the Central Powers-supported Senussi rebellion that had overran the rest of the recently-conquered Lybia until reinforced and relieved-in 1923, as even after the end of the war Italy had more pressing issues to send troops in Africa.
</li></ul></li><li> During WWII 22,800 US paratroopers of the 101st Paratroopers had to hold the line against over 54,000 German Troops with little to no air support for 7 days during the Siege of Bastogne<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5r0he');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5r0he" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5r0he');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this qualifies as a hold the line instead of A siege as the US troops only had to wait for allied air power and other US troops to arrive before the germans could take the vital crossroads at bastogne to use for their tanks and reconquer western Europe</span>.
</li><li> During the Battle of Albuera, part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">the Peninsular War</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">57th (West Middlesex) Regiment</a> managed to hold long enough that they broke the French advance, who then retreated as British reinforcements arrived. The fighting was so fierce that they lost 422 of their 570 rankers, and 20 of their 30 officers. Early on, their commander, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel William Inglis</a>, was wounded by French grapeshot, but refused to be carried away from the battle and stayed with the Regimental Colours. When the fighting was at its fiercest, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">calmly</a> proclaimed "Die hard, 57th, die hard!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6jwtd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6jwtd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6jwtd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is the origin of the phrase "Diehard"</span>, resulting in the regiment being nicknamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron">The Die Hards</a>".
</li><li> The Battle of Hill 262 (Mont Ormel). Polish armored divisions made a hasty push to take the mount, which gave them a position from which to rain fire down on German troops attempting to escape the Falaise Pocket. The United States took up positions in nearby Chambois, making the mount one of the few pathways to escape to safety. From 19 August 1944 to 21 August, the Germans pushed against the Polish with reckless abandon, and by the night of the 20th, the Polish were exhausted and dangerously low on supplies, leading to their CO, Stefanowicz, making the below <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor">It Has Been an Honor</a> speech. In the early afternoon of the 21st, the Canadians arrived and relieved the Polish army, securing the line.
<div class="indent">"Gentlemen, all is lost. I do not think that the Canadians can come to our rescue. We have only about 110 able-bodied men left. Five shells per gun and 50 bullets per man. That's very little, but fight all the same. Surrender to the S.S. is futile; you know that. I thank you. You have fought well. Good luck, gentlemen. Tonight we shall die for Poland and for civilization! . . . each tank will fight independently, and eventually each man for himself."
</div></li><li> The so-called "Olshansky's Landing" on March 26, 1944, in Nazi-occupied Mykolaiv (modern-day Ukraine). 68 volunteers from Soviet Naval Infantry landed on a bank of the Southern Bug river and occupied a number of port structures. Over the following day, they ended up repelling 18 attacks from 3 German infantry battalions and 2 tanks. In one case, a Soviet marine killed a German officer by tearing his throat out with his teeth. By the end of the day, only 11 of the volunteers were alive (Lt. Olshansky himself was, sadly, not one of them), but the 18 attacks cost the Germans over 700 men and 2 tanks, and they also failed to dislodge the Soviets.
