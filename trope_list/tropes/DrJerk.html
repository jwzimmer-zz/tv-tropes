He spits in the face of the image of doctors as saintly humanitarians — but of course, he's so prevalent now that he's become a trope of his own.
</p><p>His attitude is often explained by the notion that, in order to become such a good physician, he's had to make a habit of treating people as machines and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVersusStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVersusStoicism">never letting his feelings get in the way</a>".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> has Doctor Franken Stein, who is not only the school surgeon, but also the biology teacher and combat instructor. He is a complete sociopath due to having an insane wavelength, and upon meeting his apprentice Maka, he tried to dissect her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">trying to show his students that they needed to work together,</a> and no one was actually harmed, but as the series progresses his advances towards Maka's(and his other students') organs become more sincere. He also tends to bash his patients for their carelessness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Dr. Kureha, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">tough, sarcastic old lady</a>, is the only doctor on a small island where the inhabitants all call her a witch for her strange, violent, and greedy behavior. She won't just ask for a set amount of bills, but 50% of your income for the month. If you tip her, she may lower it to 49%. She's also willing to <em>injure</em> patients who don't follow her orders.
<ul><li> Her protege Chopper <em>tries</em> to be this whenever he's complimented, attempting to put on a tough act and belittle the complimenter while grinning ear-to-ear and doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyDance">Happy Dance</a>. It never works.
</li><li> Dr. Hogback is a much worse, being probably the best surgeon in the world and an actual villain. Even with the love of his life, he only cares about her body and thus patches her corpse up and lets her be revived with another person's soul.
</li><li> Trafalgar Law's response when someone asked what was going to happen if Luffy kept running around right after Law had done surgery on him? That the wounds would reopen and he'd die.
<ul><li> Also when telling Chopper that he'd removed the poison from the systems of some children that had been experimented on, he phrased it in such a way that Chopper thought he'd <em>dismembered</em> them, since Law was talking about the amount of painkillers some might need. Law made no move to correct the panicking reindeer.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a> is probably one of the first; generally more of the Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> variety.
<ul><li> Probably the original trope namer, considering he purposely plays himself as a devil, but gets repeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments, including how much he beats himself up for his mistakes, i.e. he treats his patients like crap, and manipulates them, but angsts over every single death. Plus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus Ex Machinas</a> that follow him...
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a> is parodied with Dr. Iwata in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> (complete with an x-shaped scar on his face, given to him by his cousin who he loves to exact horrible revenge on every opportunity he gets). Though he doesn't show up enough in the anime for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkassery</a> to really shine through, in the manga he's a money-grubbing, skirt-chasing, selfish bastard. At one point, he's shown prescribing medication to people because the pharmaceutical company that makes it pays him for each patient he gets to take it, regardless of whether or not it will actually <em>help</em> them. Fortunately, he's usually accompanied by his nurse, who uses violence on him frequently to keep him in line. The sad part: he does actually show signs of competence — he just doesn't <em>care</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with Ryuuken Ishida. Introduced from Uryuu's point-of-view, he seems abrasive, materialistic and uncaring. Eventually, it becomes clear he wants his son to think the worst of him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">unknown reasons</a> that loyal friend Isshin knows all about. Behind Uryuu's back, he's much more gentle, protective and fatherly.
</li><li> Subverted with Tenjirou Kirinji. Introduced as having a violent, abusive, delinquent mentality, he's eventually revealed to be much more gentle with his servants, as he seems to put his tutees and patients through various kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Knox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. He's quite a good man, though a bit grumpy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">punches out Lan Fan and May Chang</a> to prevent them from starting a fight, partly because of their injuries, partly to avoid them getting infected by his samples, and partly out of principle. But mostly to keep them from wrecking his house.
<div class="indent"><strong>May:</strong> <em>[wimpering]</em> Quit trying to... <br/><strong>Dr. Knox:</strong> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AFFAIRS OF YOUR COUNTRY, DUMB-ASS!!
</div><ul><li> Technically Knox isn't even a practicing doctor. Rather he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">PTSD ridden</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">army medic</a> turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoroner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoroner">coroner</a>, who got roped into things because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot">the only person with medical training who the heroes could trust</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Which makes his poor bedside manner rather understandable</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tenma's boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> is the heartless administrator variety, until he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">gets killed</a>. Tenma himself inverts this trope, as he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">one of the nicest people imaginable</a>.
</li><li> Dr. Shamal from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">towards men</a>, though. And unfortunately for him (and them), 99% of the cast is comprised of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> has Hatori, who's more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>, but he's still grumpy.
</li><li> Caren Ortensia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA</a></em>, an elementary school nurse who has the tendency to consider patient's injuries 'boring' and ask they get hurt much more badly next time they come to see her. To add insult to non-injury, she often tells visitors to get lost because "healthy people make her sick."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has Porlyusica. While she will try her hardest to save her patients, she can't stand being around people, and will kick them out as soon as they are healed. She also doesn't like the friends of her patients hanging around waiting for them to get better.
</li><li> Entirely inverted by Fran Madaraki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em>, who is the nicest, biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">Love Freak</a> you'll ever meet, willing to forgo payment on operations... but given the nature of these operations, you might actually wish she <em>was</em> actively villainous.

<ul><li> The fanfic <em>Heart of Azazel</em> has Dr. Bitch Spasms (gee, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">I wonder where that name came from</a>). Not only is he a complete disaster as a doctor, but he also makes for a terrible husband! Just read it and tell me you weren't cheering for Azazel near the end!
</li><li> Dr. Onimemo in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8661803/1/">The Eyes Have It<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is the doujutsu doctor for Konoha and a complete prick. He tells Sakura he calls her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">Patient 719</a> because he doubts he'll ever see her again. In reality, he calls her that even after they'll be seeing each other regularly. It's later shown that he calls everyone by either their patient number or, if they a patient's friend/teammate/family, by a patient number plus an addendum. For example, Sakura's teammate Kiba is 719-c. He's later shown to be considerably ruder to people who don't make appointments outside extenuating circumstances (Sasuke's Sharingan developing further doesn't warrant an immediate visit but Sakura's developing doujutsu causing her pain does).
<ul><li> It bears noting that on the one occasion Sakura visits the doctor at his home, she discovers that he married a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a> and is a complete teddy bear in her presence.

His deep cynicism comes, paradoxically, from the fact he seems to be the only doctor in Ankh-Morpork who <em>cares</em> if his patients get better, since the fee gets covered either way. Living under the regime of Lord Winder doesn't help; he's had to treat people questioned by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Cable Street Particulars</a>, and when Vimes takes a CSP officer to have a broken arm treated, Lawn offers instead to point out some sensitive places Vimes could kick him.

(He could probably work for the CIA, and in fact, in one episode he did — while taunting all the G-Men and constantly threatening to blow their cover). He has effectively blackballed himself in medical circles, but he doesn't mind, because it gives him <em>carte blanche</em> to rule over a Princeton teaching hospital albeit at a sharply reduced pay rate. In fact, pretty much the only reason he even still has a job, despite being an utter jackass, is that he's a <em>damn</em> good doctor.

When the other doctors went maverick in order to help people - something that happened a lot with Doug Ross and a fair amount with John Carter - she was there to smack them down.

<ul><li> Dr. Mark Craig. Hilariously brusque, rude, sarcastic and unsentimental, with no bedside manner to speak of, almost everyone on staff — certainly all those working under him — finds Dr. Craig <strong>extremely</strong> difficult to deal with. However, he's brilliant at his job, is (frustratingly) usually right on the money in medical matters, and he will NOT let his interns or other staff members slack at ALL — he has no compunction about berating them in public if he feels they aren't performing at their very best. But it's also clear he drives no one harder than he drives himself. Essentially an early version of Dr. House.
</li><li> Dr. Victor Ehrlich, sort of, at least in the early seasons of the show (which makes sense as he starts off as Craig's protege). However, Ehrlich's jerk-ish qualities are often more bumbling and wishy-washy than Craig's — he doesn't possess Craig's devastating, castrating wit, and while he's a gifted surgeon, Ehrlich doesn't have Craig's formidable breadth of experience and knowledge. Both characters softened somewhat as the series went on.

The show extracts a great deal of humor and drama from playing his focus on bureaucracy off of Dr. Cox's focus on patient care. However Dr. Kelso is also frequently shown to be doing the best he can with tight resources, and his personality may be a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker">having to deal with this every day.</a> He also one occasionally deliberately acts as the "asshole administrator", because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">if the staff aren't united in their hatred of him, they bicker among themselves so much that patients wind up in danger</a>.

Ironically, when Kelso retires, Cox is selected as his replacement. He has to face the same decisions that Kelso did and relies on JD to take over his previous role as the guy who stands up to the chief of medicine to keep him on the straight and narrow.

He also openly admitted (during the series that is) that he was in it for the skin care to get rid of his pimples, and he hoped to earn big money. In the TV series, he once stated that he flunked out of two medical schools and took twice the normal time to become a doctor. He was also tricked into admitting that he paid $400 (a large sum at the time) for the answers for a critical exam. He was worse in the original book. Burns was at the last era in history where a practicing physician could get a license <em>without going to medical school</em>. In Frank's case, he served an apprenticeship under his father. In the film, he is extremely religious in public, hypocritical about it (see Maj. Houlihan), and falsely blames a man's death on a very timid orderly.

Exactly why the Doctor was such a buzzkill varied between seasons. At first, he was annoyed that people treated him like an actual person rather than hologram; that is, being intended as a temporary supplement to a living doctor suddenly pressed into full service, he often found himself annoyed at being left on with nothing to do. Later, as he starts to develop more as a member of the crew, that reverses, making him more irritable because he wasn't treated <em>equally</em>.

</div><ul><li> Notably, one episode had as a plot point that having this kind of personality is actually a fairly important flaw for a doctor — the Doctor was the <em>only</em> Mk. I still in active duty as a medical hologram by that point, because Starfleet had been very quick to get Zimmerman to develop new versions, with new personalities and looks (apparently, while the actual healing part had worked fine, the bedside manner had made the original quite unpopular).

Like House, he has a strenuous (sometimes romantic) relationship with his female boss, who only tolerates his antics because he does the job well. Also, for a bit of irony, Bykov is played by a priest, who took time off from the church to do the show. The newest intern, Polina Ulyanova, only got hired because she accidentally pissed off all the other major characters whom she attempted to vouch for her in front of Bykov. Bykov, in his true style, immediately hires her to annoy everyone else.
<ul><li> After the original head nurse leaves to join her boyfriend (a former intern on the show who went to the US as part of an exchange program), Bykov convinces his girlfriend/boss to hire his ex for the position. Naturally, the girlfriend/boss is reluctant, especially when she finds out Bykov lied about meeting the ex earlier to discuss this. Bykov then bluntly tells her that she should think as an administrator and hire the woman because she's damn good at her job and leave any personal concerns out of it.

Her logic was that she was hungry and the manner in which she notified the family wouldn't have changed the fact that the man was dead. Others did not see it her way and her supervisor asked her to leave the program, since he did not feel that she could be trusted to always place her patients first.

He skips his own welcoming party to go straight to surgery, constantly berates Shaun because of his autism, refuses to listen to anyone else's attempts to speak up for Shaun (he even clashes with Melendez), and fires Shaun when he demands to be transferred back to Surgery and suffers a meltdown when Han adamantly refuses to assent to his wishes.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">G1</a></em> Ratchet is portrayed in fanon as being similar to his later incarnations, as a talented doctor who was also grouchy, constantly threatening his patients with various punishments. The Marvel G1 version was actually supposed to be a <em>party animal,</em> who was known for making the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater">high-grade</a> around. This aspect of his portrayal was dropped fairly early on, though.
</li><li> <em>Micron Legend</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Armada</a></em>) Ratchet, known to Western fans as <em>Red Alert</em>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">The Spock</a> and thus seemed to be emotionally detached from his patients in the first episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Film</a></em> Ratchet is basically the same as <em>G1</em> Ratchet, once even threatening to weld Jazz's vocal unit shut. Oddly, he fits definition one for this trope despite starting out as a politician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the UK comic</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Animated</a></em> Ratchet is a crotchety old man due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellshockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellshockedVeteran">Shellshocked Veteran</a> status.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Prime</a></em> Ratchet also has the old and crotchety thing going on ("My pistons may be rusty, but my hearing is as sharp as ever!"), in addition to being a snarky scientist type who gets <em>extremely</em> annoyed whenever any of his equipment is damaged.

She then flashes him her bare chest (again without provocation) in order to allow them to "move on." Later, she enters Francine's hosiptal room and again makes the unfair assumption Stan holds sexist prejudices against her.

That said, her attitude is generally a combination of being no-nonsense within Sickbay and a crabapple outside of it. She actually values bedside manner as an essential skill in her medical team and refuses Rutherford's transfer request because he causes a patient to panic, despite his good technical skills, and sends in the cheerful Tendi instead.

<ul><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18822_5-famous-scientists-dismissed-as-morons-in-their-time.html">explained<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18501_7-incredible-scientific-innovations-held-back-by-petty-feuds.html">twice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), the prevalence of this trope in the 19th century was the reason why it took so long for hygienic practices to catch on in hospitals. Because medicine was seen as a gentlemanly profession at the time, doctors in that era ridiculed and attacked scientists like Ignaz Semmelweis who merely suggested that they wash their hands after handling corpses in the morgue, as it seemed to imply that they were unclean enough to kill people just by touching them, coupled to the fact that the doctors were unwilling to stick their hands in corrosive and carcinogenic carbolic acid, Semmelweis' preferred antiseptic, on a daily basis. Before Louis Pasteur's germ theory proved once and for all that such basic hygiene was the right course of action, it was more dangerous to give birth in a hospital than <em>in the street</em> due to how rampant disease was within hospitals (hence why we see women giving birth at home in period works so often).
</li><li> In fact, many older doctors can come off as jerkish to modern people as they are trained to believe in the concept of "medical paternalism" (i.e. doctor knows best). They are generally much more forceful in prescribing treatments, sometimes to the point of overruling the patient (a big no-no nowadays), and can actively go out of their way to deceive the patient if they feel it is for their own good. In other words, Dr. House is what happens when the ultimate "old-school" doctor (treat the disease first, the patient be damned) starts practicing medicine in an informed consent-based (with rare exceptions, the physician must abide by the patient's wishes, even if it means the patient will die) environment.
<ul><li> On this subject, there's a cultural difference between the American and European approaches to healthcare. In America, it's routine for doctors to put elderly nursing home patients on ventilators for flu, pneumonia, etc. even if it will not change the outcome, and as long as the patient's family wants it and insurance provider is willing to pay for it, they will continue to do invasive interventions and procedures that only prolong suffering and do not improve quality of life. In European countries, whose culture is not as litigious as American culture, doctors tend to be more medical paternalists, giving them a lot more latitude to refuse to perform what they decide is futile care (whether that be transferring patients to higher levels of care, intubating patients, and even performing CPR). If the physician believes it will not benefit the patient, they are under no obligation to offer it.
</li></ul></li><li> On the softer side, Dr. Michel Cymes (often dubbed "The French Doctor House"), host of a health show on French TV, is never short of a snide remark, mainly at the expense of his co-host, Dr. Marina Carrère d'Encausse (sometimes referred as his Lisa Cuddy).
</li><li> Ernesto "Ché" Guevara was originally a practicing doctor before turning revolutionary. His methods could be downright brutal, and bedside manner wasn't really his strong suit. Many people who knew him described him as humorless and mean. He was, however, considered to be a very proficient doctor.
</li><li> It also bears noting that while doctors don't have to be jerks, surgeons need to be emotionally cold at best, and psychopathic at worst just to do their job effectively when your life is on the line. They CANNOT afford to be distracted by emotions at all. A lot more surgeons follow this trope than doctors, and this is actually a good thing.
