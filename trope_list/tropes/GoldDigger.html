</p><p>We use "<em>she</em>" because the digger is usually (but not always) female in modern shows, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">MUCH more attractive than her partner</a>.

This may also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">All Women Are Prudes</a>, resulting in the idea that the only reason women ever have sex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit">is to gain access to a man's money and/or get men to buy them things</a>, while the only reason men even bother to make money in the first place is so that they can have sex with lots of hotties (specifically hot <em>women</em> if the man in question is straight). Hell, this trope can even overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">All Women Are Lustful</a> if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket">Meal Ticket</a> can satisfy his wife's material desires but not her sexual desires, which may lead her to seek her fix on the side from other, more attractive and virile men.

</p><p>Many a gold digger would be happy to marry a man who is old or in bad health, just so long as he'd be so kind as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillAndInheritanceTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillAndInheritanceTropes">leave at least some of his inheritance</a> to his spouse when he die.

If the wife isn't that bloodthirsty but her husband doesn't seem likely to die naturally anytime soon, she may instead take control of his fortune by screwing him over in a divorce settlement.

Another way that works play with this is to have a rich man pretending to be poor, so as to ensure that any woman he becomes involved with loves him for himself and not his money.

</p><p>Also common are women who go after young members of the armed forces, and the United States stereotype of the "dependapotamus" outlines this best: a woman in her late teens or very early twenties who lurks around the base or near wherever young soldiers typically congregate, who hooks the first naive young boy who grew up in some podunk backwater locale, gets married to him extremely fast (usually within months), and then does the absolute bare minimum while leeching off of him and his military benefits, and probably cheats on him whenever they're deployed as well.
</p><p>Historically, this used to be the rule for <em>both</em> parties; back then the now-rare male "fortune hunters" were much more common (stereotypically, they would woo young heiresses without parental protection or older women with money but no looks). This was particularly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian Britain</a>, as economic changes forced many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">Peers</a> to face that their old way of life had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">become unsupportable</a> (particularly their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">country estates</a>). Their primary source of income since the Middle Ages had been agriculture, but the main crop (grain) could be far more cheaply grown in the United States, Canada, Russia, and (later) Australia where land was abundant, and with steamships it could also be imported so cheaply the importers could undersell the aristocrats even though they were bringing the stuff from the far side of the world. The economics were fairly similar regarding livestock (a possible alternative to selling grain), with the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina often being able to undersell domestic British producers of beef, mutton, and pork, especially after the invention of refrigerated ships around the 1880s meant that the meat could be transported "on the hook" (i.e. as already slaughtered fresh meat) rather than "on the hoof" (i.e. as living animals) or as cured meat<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fl0o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fl0o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fl0o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Live animals need to be fed and cared for while on ship. Dead meat does not eat (or poop).</span> (though this wasn't as consistent; some British producers could keep up with the New World).
</p><p>The aristocrats initially tried to "fix" their problem with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">protectionism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but this failed. Since that left only dairy and fruit-and-vegetable production as viable agricultural alternatives, and the British market could only absorb so much butter (which Ireland was better for producing anyway) and jam, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney">young British nobles married the daughters</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">self-made industrialists and merchants</a> (who had previously been seen as too low-class for the upper crust to marry), particularly American ones.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nlge');"><sup>For instance </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nlge" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nlge');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lord Randolph Churchill marrying Jennie Jerome, the daughter of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York</a> banker—their name should sound familiar, as they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston</a>'s parents.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> even <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_heiresses">has a list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. By the 20th century the male gold diggers almost disappeared (except for more villainous roles), and middle-class women were now getting married to richer men, establishing the current image of this trope. A modern variant known as "FinDom", or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_domination">Financial Domination<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, couples this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a>, where the wealthier partner acts as the submissive, and is decidedly more up-front about it.
</p><p>Another male variant exists in the Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> subculture: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> artists, especially lifestylers or current or ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">Delinquents</a>, are almost unemployable outside of their own industry in a culture dependent on conformity as a requisite of traditional employment. As a result, quite a few indies, beginning, or unsuccessful artists will work in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostClub">Host Club</a> and/or seek out a <em>mitsukano</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">mitsukare</a></em> ("honey woman" or "honey man") to provide for them on a financial level.

<ul><li> Linda's husband Richard is a rare male example. It's clear he only married Linda for her and her family's money. He and Linda never seem particularly close, Richard is rude and crass to most of her family, and Linda's siblings clearly only tolerate him for her sake. Even Harlan refers to him as a deadbeat in his final letter to Linda.

Keifer Porter is a rare example of a man who was fully onboard with his sisters' decision to marry him to the Princesses - they got the money, and became sisters-in-law with the royals, he got fancy clothes and jewelery, a luxurious life, and was planning on having the husband's quarters redecorated with gilding and all sorts of expensive extras. The Whistlers, being a poor family, are suspected of being gold-diggers, but they aren't; they want Jerin to be happy, and never even <em>dreamt</em> of being able to marry him to a noble family before the opportunity presented itself.

She maintains the pretense of selfless devotion to him, even after he is disowned because of her, until she has secured a better prospect: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his younger brother</span>.
</li><li> Mr. Willoughby leaves the penniless Marianne Dashwood, whom he loves, for the wealthy heiress Miss Grey. The devastated Marianne eventually concedes that he never would have been satisfied as a poorer man married to her even though they loved each other—material wealth simply mattered to him more than love.

The eldest daughter, the perfect Jane, falls in love with a rich man geniunely; the middle sister Mary, who feels unworthy because she can't do the only thing her mother would approve because she isn't charming enough, shies away from the world and retreats into books; and the youngest two sisters are airheads who end up risking a lot while flirting. Socially and economically, her daughters don't have any other options: they are poor and have no dowry.
</li><li> Elizabeth is not a typical gold digger, despite her snarky hints she first began to love Mr Darcy when she saw his beautiful estate in Derbyshire. At first, Elizabeth shied away from Darcy in part <em>because</em> of his wealth; indeed, she <em>despises</em> him at first because he appears to be a snob. She <em>does</em> become open to his friendship (and courtship) after visiting his vast estate, but that has more to do with seeing how much his servants admire him, how nice he is to his sister, and his politeness towards her aunt and uncle despite knowing that they're in trade.
</li><li> Elizabeth's suitor Mr. Wickham is a typical Austen gold digger; it's eventually revealed that he tricked wealthy Georgiana Darcy into running away with him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(but he's thwarted before he can get at her money)</span>. It's implied that he courts Elizabeth only until he realizes she isn't an heiress, and starts paying attention to Miss King immediately after she inherits some money.

</li><li> Mary Crawford, though an heiress herself, initially considers pursuing Sir Thomas' heir Tom, and is shocked to find herself falling in love with Edmund (the younger son), whom she knows will not inherit a fortune and is, therefore, simply out of the question as husband material. She can't reconcile her feelings for him with her determination to marry a man of fortune until his older brother falls ill, and she's thrilled because, if he dies, Edmund will inherit his title and estate... an attitude that does <em>not</em> make Edmund very happy when he hears about it.

Joanne was a failed actress in her late 30's. She married her husband for his money, promising to make him a good wife and give him a baby if she could. The marriage was very happy and she was genuinely upset at his death, while recognising that everyone thought this was she had been waiting for.
</li><li> Noelle Page in <em>The Other Side of Midnight</em> is a poor French girl who is (in essence) sold to a disgusting-but-rich shopkeeper as a mistress by her father. She flees after bilking the shopkeeper out of some money, but then falls in love with and is abandoned by an American pilot. In order to destroy him, and having learned her lesson from the prior experience, she proceeds to woo increasingly powerful men, culminating in becoming a Greek tycoon's mistress. Wooing the right men also helps her become an internationally beloved actress, which is all part of the plan.

He is really good at his job, and through his purchasing power and investment capabilities, he accidentally transforms a down-time town with an economic boom, just so he can supply his troops with what they need. When the local towns people realize his wealth and influence, (as the book puts it) "the campaign to introduce him to every unmarried daughter, niece, cousin and sister in the area kicked into high gear". It is pretty clear that the driving force for this were the adults doing the introducing, while the motivations of the girls being introduced was left unstated.

Since Angels are forbidden from breeding with each other (unless given special dispensation from Jovah), they have to interbreed with humans. Any woman who bears an Angel child (or man who fathers an Angel child) is taken into the Angel parent's community and lives in luxury for the rest of their days. The result is a subcommunity of young men and women living near the Angels trying to snare an Angel lover. Since the child of a human and an Angel isn't always an Angel, there is also the secondary result of a large number of human children birthed by an Angel-Seeker and then discarded when their parent decides to make another try for an Angel child.

<ul><li> Walther Gassner married Anna Roffe, a woman considerably older than him and with no attractives other than being the heiress of the German branch of the family of the founder of a big pharmaceutical company. Anna's father tried to bribe him out and he used the money to buy her a wedding ring.

She got married to an old British lord, who would turn out to be an abusive alcoholic, rather than accepting the proposal from Seth, the story's male protagonist, who wasn't rich yet at the time. And even as she later <em>does</em> get engaged to Seth, she does it only because she needs someone to help her with financial issues. But then, she finds true love at the exact same time as Seth gets reunited with Beatrice, the story's female protagonist, and they amicably agree to not get married after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation">Christian Nation</a></em>, the protagonist Greg's girlfriend Emilie will only marry him as long as he is a successful lawyer.

Sandry is heiress to the Landreg lands, and Empress Berenene wants to ensure that all the wealth and income from the property will stay in Namorn, so she sets several pliable courtiers to wooing Sandry.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance">Through Alien Eyes</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> initiator Juna Saari is told that she must be married within four months of giving birth so that her child will be raised with both human and alien caretakers. She's courted by the powerful Xavierra family, which owns much of the Moon. This is a two-way use of this trope, in a way; she's interested in the Xavierras because they're very wealthy, while they are interested in her connections to aliens and fame.

However, most are more subtle about it than Eshevis Tethimar, who is very determined to marry Maia's sister, the Archduchess Vedero Drazhin, who doesn't even want to get married to <em>anyone</em>. In arranging a marriage for himself, Maia uses his hand in marriage as bribe to placate a noble house that his father had snubbed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds">Bridge of Birds</a></em>, Lotus Cloud is known as "the most expensive woman in China" because she causes all of her suitors to go bankrupt in less than a week trying to please her with constant gifts of pearls and jade. Subverted, however, in that she isn't actually forcing or asking her suitors to give her all these riches; they just can't resist seeing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">smile</a> every time she receives pearls or jade. Subverted even further in that she actually doesn't want pearls and jade because she's greedy but because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they subconsciously remind her of her real name, Jade Pearl, that she had been mind-wiped into forgetting by her current husband</span>.
</li><li> The male version is common in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a>," where down-at-the-heels noblemen are noted to seek not rich wives, but wealthy mistresses. This is not the only reason that D'Artagnan falls for his landlord's wife (Madame Bonacieux), but as he notes, it certainly doesn't hurt things.

Rachel genuinely had no clue that Nick's family was wealthy when they started dating.
</li><li> Kitty Pong plays this straight. She breaks up with Alistair after Oliver convinces her that he is too "poor" for her and lures her into marrying billionaire Bernard.
</li><li> At Araminta's bachelorette party, one of Araminta's friends faces the terrible dilemma that her boyfriend, while rich, is not rich <em>enough</em> to provide for her lifestyle. Another friend says this is reason enough for her to dump him and find a richer boyfriend.

He pays lip service when her father warns that he's made legal provision to make sure Olivia's husband can never touch her money, and Malcolm evidently thinks that he'll be able to get around this - but he never does, and it becomes a source of increasing resentment toward her.

In something of a twist, for all his cockiness when she's not around, in his relationship with Marcy it's made pretty clear that he's nevertheless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">a spineless doormat</a> almost completely under her thumb as a result.

The marriage starts rocky, then they are happy for a while, but then it goes into the crapper. A large part of Pete's early success in the firm is due to him getting the Vicks account due to his father-in-law being an executive with the company. When the father-in-law finds out that Pete is cheating on Trudy, he pulls the account and costs Pete and the firm a lot of money.
</li><li> Early on in the series Ken Cosgrove expressed the sentiment that he would love to marry a rich woman whose executive father would give Ken a big account for the firm. However, when Ken does in fact marry such a woman, he steadfastly refuses to mix his family life with business and is shown to be highly successful even without his wife's money.

On the other hand, Richard Bellamy, one of the major characters, is suspected by his father-in-law of being a gold digger to the point that he ties up Lady Marjorie's money so Richard can't get to it after she dies. It is true that Richard was a poor parson's son, who aspired to the hand of an earl's daughter and used his marital connections to build his career in Parliament. But on the other hand, he actually did love Lady Marjorie and was devastated by her death.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> provides a subversion: one of their clients finds out that his fiancee was after his money at first, but then genuinely fell in love with him.

</li><li> Kirsty MacColl's "I'm Going Out with an Eighty-Year-Old Millionaire" is a over-the-top parody of the phenomenon.
</li><li> "Daddy (You Oughta Get The Best For Me)" by Bob Troup; Sammy Kaye recorded the first hit version, but there are lots and lots of cover versions. The song is "'bout a gal named Daisy Mae" who sings she wants such things as "a brand new car, champagne, caviar."
</li><li> "Why don't you do right?" by Joe McCoy, performed by many many (including Jessica Rabbit). "Why don't you do right like some other men do? Get out of here and get me some money too!" The later version used by Disney differs considerably from the original ("Weed Smoker's Dream"), which is fully of <em>very</em> thinly veiled suggestions that women <em>should</em> become gold diggers (or possibly prostitutes). "Sitting on a million, sitting on it every day, can't make no money giving your stuff away, why don't you do now like the millionaires do? Put your stuff on the market, and make a million too." Some of the verses are even <em>more</em> blatant than the chorus.

Despite his choruses warnings, he kept asking for her back but she kept rejecting him for richer boyfriends.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chorus</strong>: <em>Oh shit, she's a gold digger - Just thought you should know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">nigga</a></em>

The title sounds like an allusion to the term "rent boy" to mean "male prostitute", and the chorus is the words "I love you, you pay my rent" repeated over and over.

His family cut him out of the will when he married Blondie Boopadoop(!), whom they believed to be a gold digger. To be fair, they might not have been entirely wrong at the time. The strip is called "Blondie," though Dagwood is clearly the more comedic character today, because originally it was about Blondie the flapper girl's crazy antics, with her then-boyfriend Dagwood playing straight man. After they got married and found themselves suddenly middle-class (at best), Blondie underwent a lot of character development.

Dwarves have a very strict caste system that determines each dwarf's profession, with casteless dwarves filling the very bottom rung. Female casteless dwarves commonly engage in "noble hunting," where they seduce a male dwarf noble and have his child. Caste is inherited from the same-gender parent, so if that baby is a boy, it will be a Noble, and he and his mother will be adopted into the house of the child's father. This is even encouraged in dwarven society, as their population is dwindling from constant attacks by the darkspawn. However, this can very easily backfire. If the child is a girl, it will be born Casteless, and leave the mother no better off economically or socially, with her dreams dashed, little hope of seducing another noble and another mouth to feed.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Shego</a> was this close being it in Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>. Granted, considering how proud she is to be an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> that was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a> moment.
<ul><li> A straight example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Bonnie</a> going after Ron Stoppable's 99 million dollars. She promptly leaves after it gets stolen because she told Ron to keep it in his pocket.
</li></ul></li><li> Demona and Thailog scheme to do this to Macbeth, using a human Demona as bait in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>.

Kanye West's song was played over a montage of her shopping with Granddad, just to make sure we got it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain">Jason Phillip</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Macendale</span>, better known as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Hobgoblin</span> tried to marry Felicia Hardy to get access to her wealth. When she found out his alter-ego, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he threatened to kill her unless she goes through it</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, when Bender undergoes a robot sex-change operation, Calculon becomes smitten with "Coilette" (AKA: female Bender). Bender intends to marry Calculon, then immediately divorce him for half his stuff. Unfortunately, he develops genuine feelings (or at least a desire to not screw him over) for him.
<ul><li> Bender also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">assumes</a> that this is why Fry starts dating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">Amy</a>:
<div class="indent">"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend! Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics..."
</div></li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Marge's sister Selma (Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson) at one point tells Marge that she from now on will only be marrying for love... "and maybe once more for money."
<ul><li> And she got the surname "Terwilliger" from Sideshow Bob, who tried to kill her for money and would have gotten away with that if not for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">that meddling Bart Simpson</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Jez on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>, apparently. She seems largely uninterested in being romantic with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Lucius</a>, but has no qualms about using his stuff. Sure enough, the moment the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episode</a> happens, she dumps him.
</li><li> Kelly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/Stoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternANimation/Stoked">Stōked</a></em>, when she begins dating Lo's brother (and Emma's crush) Ty Ridgemount simply because he is the son of hotel owner Mr. Ridgemount.
</li><li> At least two cartoon shorts from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> (One of them featuring Daffy Duck) involved a male gold digger marrying a rich widow... and finding himself having to put up with her bratty kid and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">live his life according to her whims</a>. After much physical and mental abuse, the gold digger decides he's had enough and leaves her.
<ul><li> The other short featured Yosemite Sam, who entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepfather</a> territory by trying to off the kid (who in this case isn't so much bratty as dangerously large and naive like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyHuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyHuey">Baby Huey</a>). As he left, he asked himself if all of that was worth five million dollars. Five million dollars? He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">ran back to the mansion</a>.
</li><li> Sam tried to marry another rich widow (played by Granny) in "Hare Trimmer", but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> saw through the act and posed as a rival suitor (and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">Granny herself</a>) to save her.
</li><li> In the classic cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDoverBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDoverBoys">The Dover Boys</a></em>, this is part of what motivates coward, bully, cad and thief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DastardlyWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DastardlyWhiplash">Dan Backslide's</a> pursuit of Dora Standpipe. He is as subtle about this as he is about everything else.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Dear rich Dora Standpipe! HOW I LOVE HER... father's money."
</div></li><li> Lady Jasmine turns out to be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "The Prince And The Hopper", when Smurfette finds out that Prince Theodore's bride-to-be is only interested in marrying him for the money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheKidsFromRoom402" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheKidsFromRoom402">The Kids From Room 402</a></em>: Mr. Besser and, as it seems, every other man who ever married his (ex) wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Poison Ivy plays around with the trope, using her powers to create beautiful plant-women to marry Gotham's wealthiest citizens and later kill them for their money.
</li><li> In "Joker's Millions", a psychiatrist indignantly denies that he was bribed to give the Joker a clean bill of mental health. He is then seen getting into a flashy new car with an attractive woman about half his age.
</li><li> Baby Doll winds up falling for Killer Croc because she sees much of herself in him - but his only interest with her is how much money they can make for crimes she plans and he executes.
</li></ul></li><li> Cross-reference this Trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch">The Grinch</a> and you'll likely get Cousin Mel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrandmaGotRunOverByAReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrandmaGotRunOverByAReindeer">Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer</a></em>. Granma even describes her as such.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>: Doughy develops a crush on his teacher, Miss Sculptham and starts buying her presents with the money his parents give him to leave them alone. She takes advantage of this even though she clearly has no interest in her student. When he runs out of money, Doughy becomes this to Creepler in order to keep buying gifts for Miss Sculptham, until he realizes she's just taking advantage of him.
</li><li> Scrooge McDuck almost married one of these in the Season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTalesS1E58TilNephewsDoUsPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTalesS1E58TilNephewsDoUsPart">Til Nephews Do Us Part</a>". He realized the truth right before saying "I do"... and right before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers">Goldie showed up</a>, at his nephews' invite. However, it seems she didn't learn, and starts trying to hit on Flintheart Glomgold. (She clearly does <em>not</em> think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers">Second Place Is for Losers</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Action</em> ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duncan wins</span> has Courtney rushing over to celebrate winning "together", with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duncan himself</span> lampshading how obvious the ploy is. In <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beth's ending</span>, she's disappointed about him losing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">but still agrees to go out to dinner with him.</a>
</li><li> After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his elimination</span> in <em>The Ridonculous Race</em>, Noah notes that being married to a lawyer (Emma) means he won't have to bother looking for a job. Owen is amused by this, and jokingly threatens to tell Emma.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien">All Hail King Julien</a></em> has Clover's sister Crimson. When Crimson and King Julien become engaged, Clover accuses her of simply being a Gold Digger citing an extremely long chain of men she's used and abandoned as evidence. As the wedding breaks up for entirely unrelated reasons, it's left vague if Crimson really loved Julien or just his power.
</li><li> A beautiful white cat in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> short "Blue Cat Blues" comes off as this, as she falls head over heels for Butch over Tom due to the fact that the latter's gifts were more expensive than the former's.
</li><li> The Valentine's Day special of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdgarAndEllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdgarAndEllen">Edgar &amp; Ellen</a></em> has Edgar fall in love with a pretty Goth girl named Ursula.
