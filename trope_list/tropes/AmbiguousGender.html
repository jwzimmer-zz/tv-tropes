</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anakuro Hirooki, a.k.a. Space Hero "Thirteen", is referred to as the "gentle<em>man</em> hero", but their actual gender is unclear. Both the manga and anime make it a point to never show Thirteen's body outside of their space suit costume, their costume appearing empty after being torn open by Kurogiri, and their hospitalized body being off screen while the scene focuses on their costume against a wall. The only part of their body that is visible in costume is their thin legs, which doesn't help. The anime further complicates matters by giving them a female voice actress in both the original Japanese and English dubs, as it is not uncommon to give male characters female voices to simulate a higher pitched male. In the English dub, they're the only one of the teachers helping out in the final exams who aren't addressed as "Mr." or "Ms."- in Japanese, the "-sensei" honorific is gender neutral. The question was finally settled by a guidebook released for the manga's five-year anniversary, <em>Ultra Analysis</em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://comicbook.com/anime/2019/10/15/my-hero-academia-thirteen-gender-confirmed/">which revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Thirteen is... female.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito</span> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is female, however <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was raised male by her family and drawn masculine looking because of this. Before the gender reveal it's implied that Akito really is male so that's what the anime creators assumed. Therefore, in the anime Akito is male and in the manga Akito is female</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Due to the revelation that the spirit of Blue-Eyes White Dragon was carried by Kisara's soul, there are debates whether Blue-Eyes is female or not. But it's never answered officially.

No body except a demonic arm, uses '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">boku</a>' and initially primarily a female voice. Then, Yubel starts shifting from a feminine to a masculine voice and back, and also mixes that in with the voice of the host's. Characters also refer to him/her as, well, him and her. The answer, of course, is that Yubel is an intersex human/spirit fusion... living being (and we're not counting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their past self</span>). The weirdest part is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yubel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">was once human</a>, was a friend of a young prince who would become Judai in a future life, and volunteered to become the demonic creature to act as his spirit guide. But even then, whether Yubel was a boy or a girl while human, despite being seen in a flashback, it's hard to tell.</span>
</li><li> Kino, the main character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em>, is pretty darn ambiguous. Kino's gender <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">female</span> is indirectly revealed in one episode, and in one of the movies Kino has a monologue about whether to use male or female pronouns (eventually deciding on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">"boku"</a></span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the mons belonging to characters in the anime do not have their gender confirmed. Further complicating the issue are the ones that only have confirmed genders in one language. After that, viewers have to deal with whether to use male or female pronouns for the officially non-gendered mons (Ditto, Shedinja, a couple Steel-types, and most legendaries) as even the dubs have used genders in some cases.
</li><li> Ash's Pikachu. Arguments often occurred over his (now-confirmed) gender. Even the makers of the show didn't know what gender he was, until they decided to throw a Togepi with Attract at him and Meowth. Attract only works on Pokémon of the opposite gender; Meowth was confirmed male LONG ago, therefore the Togepi is female, therefore Pikachu is male (Attract affected him). The games have also confirmed this in their own way: ever since minor (not always obvious) physical differences between female and male Pokémon were added to the franchise, female Pikachu have a notch at the end of their tails, which Ash's Pikachu has always lacked. Averted in the Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese dubs; these languages do not have gender-neutral pronouns and referred to Pikachu with male pronouns.
</li><li> Attract quickly became the go-to move to confirm a Pokémon's gender in the anime. Emolga abused the hell out of it before Iris caught her (and many times afterward too), and Snivy had the move used against her by another female Snivy.
</li><li> The Staryu and Starmie from the anime confuse the issue even further. Despite one evolving from the other, the Staryu has a male-sounding voice while the Starmie's voice sounds female. According to the Pokédex in Japanese version, Staryu is classified as a Hermaphrodite.
</li></ul></li><li> Belial from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>. All the angels are supposed to pick a specific sex and take drugs to change their body to match. Belial quits partway through the process and ends up androgynous.

</li><li> Yazz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> was an alien who looked like a blue pterodactyl in a vest. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> asked "Don't you miss the female of your species?" Yazz replied "What if I <em>am</em> the female of my species?" Wally then kept badgering the alien to say whether or not that was a joke, and Yazz found this need to know so intriguing that they decided to leave it ambiguous so as to continue observing the behaviour.

This in turn has given rise to the belief that there <em>are</em> no dwarf women and that dwarves simply spring out of holes in the ground, which is of course ridiculous."

(Referring to one as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">it</a>" is considered rude, and given what they tend to do to people who offend - or even annoy - them, not wise.) Other species, like the Verpine, don't have the same concept of gender most species would, leading to gender-neutral terminology as "younglings" and "gentlebeings" being in common use, particularly in the Republic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vidocq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vidocq">Vidocq</a></em> intentionally leaves the true sex of the Alchemist vague for most of the film. The character is covered in loose black robes and wears a head-covering mask. The letters written by the Alchemist vary from demonic threats to feminine coyness, and the character's shrill, metallic voice sometimes has a distinctly feminine edge, especially the moans in some battle sequences. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All these are Red Herrings.

Yet, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight">Transformers: The Last Knight</a></em>, there are three baby Dinobots as well and an implication that they were sired <em>somehow</em> by Grimlock, Strafe, and Slug. This brings the Dinobots' genders into question, especially considering that in the Bayverse Cybertronians are suggested to have a much more... <em>human-like</em> method of reproduction.

(Figuring this out is the first step in courting someone.) There are a handful of known females (Gloria Thogsdaughter, Cheri Littlebottom, Lars Skulldrinker, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dee</span>, and Rhys (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> later Blodwen</span>) Rhysson) and one known male (Casanunda).

</li><li> The idea is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em>, in which he introduces a dwarf keen on asserting her femininity (Cheri, above) with techniques such as makeup. However, she refuses to shave her beard because, though she is proud to be a female, she felt that doing so would be denying that she was a dwarf.
</li><li> Later in the series, the possibility of new ambiguity is introduced when it's acknowledged that <em>presenting</em> as female doesn't mean the dwarf's identity has to line up with their physiology. Specifically, there's nothing stopping a so-interested male dwarf from wearing skirts and make-up.
</li><li> Inverted in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golem</a> that looks over Moist von Lipwig in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>.

It has eyelashes, so <em>maybe</em> it's a girl, but it's still hard to determine. The doctor and the "food voice counsellor"'s genders also haven't been specified.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch">Imperial Radch</a></em> series, all Radchaai citizens are this, as their culture does not mark gender differentiation in any way; in the text, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a> means all characters are referred to as "she" unless Breq is speaking in another language.

Mallory claims at one point to not be a man, and has a penis, masculine body, breasts, and a feminine face, but due to the nature of the setting it's inhabitants are able to change their physical traits at will, so everyone tends to conform to whatever gender they feel they are. Similarly, Nova has some trouble in the second volume to settle on a gendered pronoun and keeps switching back and forth. That is said to be due to being an amalgam of several people of different genders.

</li><li> Douglas Hofstadter's <em>Metamagical Themas</em> features a dialogue between people of intentionally unspecified gender, named Chris, Pat, and Sandy (interestingly, in the context of a discussion of the life of Alan Turing). When translated, the translators used epicene names in their own language, such as <em>Dominique</em> in French.
</li><li> Pwt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MuseMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MuseMagazine">Muse Magazine</a></em>. The subject is one of constant argument on the Muse Mail page. There was one cartoon in which the crow sings a limerick about how pleased he is Pwt, having a cold, can't keep up with him to chase him. He repeatedly refers to Pwt with male pronouns. Perhaps he just felt the need to use pronouns and flipped a coin or something, but it was once cited in a letter as proof Pwt is male.
</li><li> The Angel Islington of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em> is so androgynously beautiful that it has no obvious gender and is referred to as "it". A few characters do call it a "he" at some points, but always go back to calling Islington an "it", implying that they only do so because they're not used to talking about a genderless being. The narrative persists in using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">the dehumanizing "it"</a>, which suggests a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">ambiguity</a> about its nature.

They live in the Tower of Hermaphrodites, and they find the sacred in perfect balance between opposites, starting with "male" and "female".
</li><li> Alex, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pharmakembru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pharmakembru">Pharmakembru</a>: The Face</em> never has their gender stated.

Mia and her friends can't figure out whether Perin is male or female until their French teacher calls Perin a boy, leading poor Perin to have to point out in front of her entire class that she's actually a girl.
</li><li> Yuu Valentine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectNRI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectNRI">Project NRI</a></em>. In-text, the pronoun used for Yuu is 'they'.
<div class="indent"><em>"A... man? A woman? Noriko couldn't tell, but with their chiseled features and gentle demeanor, they were certainly very beautiful."</em>
</div></li><li> In <em>Raptor</em>, Thorn (the main character) is intersex. "He" lives most of his life as a male but lived in a convent for a year and can easily pass as attractive members of both genders (voice midway, taller than some men but shorter than some women, etc). Early in the book, he deliberately dresses in ambiguous clothing, confusing his hunting companion who simply can't figure out his gender (and won't ask, since he figures Thorn is deliberately hiding it). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He meets another one.

In the <em>Farseer</em> trilogy there's the Fool, who the narrator Fitz believes is male. The <em>Liveship Traders</em> trilogy has a totally different dramatis personae, including the female Amber. It's never stated that these two are the same person, but more and more clues are dropped as the trilogy progresses, and because Amber advises Althea on how to disguise herself as a boy we start to think he/she is really female and was disguised as male in the earlier books. But in the <em>Tawny Man</em> trilogy, where we and Fitz are told outright that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both characters are the same person</span>, there's a section where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fitz inhabits the Fool's body and can presumably tell what sex he/she is, but never tells us! Fitz implies that the Fool's kind are so different from humans that neither gender is appropriate — but then there's the Pale Woman to account for, who is clearly female, leading to the conclusion that not all Whites are the same</span>. This is in line with the Fool's claim that where he comes from, people don't insist on the existence of only two genders.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiverOfTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiverOfTeeth">River of Teeth</a></em>, Hero's gender is kept a secret throughout the story, and the narration uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderNeutralWriting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderNeutralWriting">gender-neutral pronouns</a> when talking about them. It is made clear that Hero does not conform outwardly to any gender and several characters seem confused, though only the bad guy makes any verbal note about it. Hero seems prepared to avoid questions regarding their gender and is surprised when Houndstooth does not pry any further even after they become lovers.
</li><li> The Person of Indeterminate Gender from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>, who is called "he or she" or "it" even by other members of Count Olaf's troupe.

Possibly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of this writing in the TV adaptation they are changed to an overall more pleasant person who seems to be interested in social issues.

Gender pronouns have been greatly depreciated by Mycroft's time, to the point that whenever he <em>does</em> use them, he apologizes to the readers. Sometimes he even admits that his pronouns aren't matching an individual's biological sex, but he still uses the pronoun he does because the person acts so stereotypically masculine/feminine, no matter what their biology.

Beyond that, no other mention is made or needed, and several angels are described in ways that are decidedly not humanoid.
</li><li> The Jewish God comes off as this to those who know enough Hebrew. Most if not all of "His" names and titles (such as Father and Lord) are male, and the religion is usually patriarchal, but many of the god's attributes such as "His" spirit, breath, presence or wings are described in feminine terms due to the Semitic languages' grammatical gender. It is not so noticeable in English due to its lack of gender outside of obviously male and female words, but even then God is described as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">mother bear</a> at one point. A bit less ambiguous in Christianity, due to many of its texts being in Greek (which doesn't have this ambiguity), the whole Father-Son dynamic - the truly ambiguous member of the Christian Trinity is the Holy Spirit, who is often depicted in a feminine form if given an kind of form at all.
</li><li> In Buddhism, Guanyin (known as the God/Goddess of Mercy) is a bodhisattva that is depicted as either male or female. It's not uncommon for Buddhist temples in East Asian countries that have statues that depicts Guanyin as male, while others depict the bodhisattva as female. This is a justified trope, as it represents the limitless transcendence beyond gender, as gender does not have any meaning with Guanyin as long as the person understands what Guanyin represents.

It doesn't quite work out as planned; they become beautiful and utterly androgynous, but they're <em>so</em> beautiful that they can't possibly be anything natural, and thus still unnerve people.

To confuse matters further, they are able to shift to a biologically male or female form at will.
</li><li> Also in <em>Awakening</em>, all but one of the ruling Exarchs are referred to alternately as male or female (the exception being the Father, who embodies the divine patriarch).

Interestingly, while the first and second game have the same character model for the Shaper, the drawings accompanying the loading screens make "him" look more male in the first game and more female in the second.

</li><li> Poison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em>. The designers were worried about her, given that North American players might have objected to a character hitting a girl, so whether she was female, a male transvestite, or transsexual was debated for awhile. They finally settled on male-to-female transsexual in all continuities, the only difference being whether she's pre-op (Japan) or post (everywhere else that cares). (Of course, this ignores the fact that there were <em>two</em> female Mooks in the original game; Poison and Roxy were color swaps, and Roxy was <em>definitely</em> female. A profile of the characters that claimed Poison was a man also addressed Roxy as a "she" who disliked Poison's cross-dressing.)
</li><li> Zohar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilhouetteMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilhouetteMirage">Silhouette Mirage</a></em>.

Its final form is muscular like a male, yet the "eyes" of the mask resemble breasts, and it has a high-pitched voice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>: At first, given that Pyro had the same voice actor as the clearly male Spy, all indication were that Pyro was a guy. The confusion started in a line on the Pyro's profile that stated "...if he is even a man". This was apparently meant to be about the Pyro's evil personality (which turns out isn't entirely right), but several fans thought that meant the Pyro might be female. Later on the developers ran with it and an update added a flowery purse to the inventory (apparently as a lame reference to Pyro being a "flamer") leading to more confusion on the part of the user base. Since the full body-suit and mask prevented any real confirmation, Valve ran with the idea, editing the posts on the official blog, changing subtle references to the Pyro's gender, just to screw with people's minds. This ambiguity then carried into in-game with the pre-2011 menu interface, in which the class recommendation window has the seemingly innocent and consistent line "Why don't you give him a shot?" when recommending a class to the player... Except when the Pyro appears, it changes randomly between "him" and "her". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is "Not telling is funnier than anything we could say".

</li><li> No one knows for sure what Seem's gender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander">Jak 3: Wastelander</a></em> is. Their body type is ambiguous, which is amplified by the many layers of clothing and armor they wears. They could be male, because they were originally scripted as such. Daxter refers to him/her as 'monk boy' and Seem never corrects him. The trophy for rescuing him/her at the temple is titled "dude in distress". In the Spanish, Italian, German and French versions of the game, Seem is stated to be male and is voiced by a male actor. A fan emailed Naughty Dog and <a class="urllink" href="http://the-precursors.livejournal.com/42353.html">the answer received was "Seem is male."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And the official <em>Jak 3</em> website gives their gender as male. The URL showing the final concept art on Bob Rafei's website <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bobrafei.com/galleries/jak3/characters/source/seem-girl-merged.htm">contains "Seem girl merged"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Another fan emailed Naughty Dog as well and the answer <em>they</em> received <a class="urllink" href="http://the-precursors.livejournal.com/42600.html">was "Seem is a girl."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">creator commentary</a> and official guide refer to him/her as female.
</li><li> The Makeover Mage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>. The mage may appear, when you first see him/her, to be man or a woman. That's because the mage keeps switching between being a guy and being a girl, so it's <em>impossible</em> to tell their gender.
</li><li> The merfolk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland">Tales of Monkey Island</a></em>. Guybrush is rather unsettled that he can't tell what gender they are. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Winslow seems to be less unsettled and ends up in a romance with one.</span>
</li><li> This is a trait of the Lapine race in <em>Pandora Saga</em>; the race has no gender selection as the males and females are almost impossible to tell apart. At one point the lapine host of the first trailer gets angry at the audience for not being able to tell. Naturally, the real answer is interrupted.
</li><li> The first thing Subaru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove">So Long, My Love</a></em> does in the game is respond to the protagonist wondering about Subaru's gender by saying that the "difference in organs" doesn't really matter, and "Subaru is Subaru". This ambiguity persists throughout the game; for every line that hints that Subaru is really female, there's another that suggests that Subaru's really male. In the English version, characters refer to Subaru as "she" (as does Subaru on one occasion, which seems a bit out of character, but it can't be easy to translate for an ambiguously-gendered character who's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">Third-Person Person</a>); however, in the original Japanese Subaru is never referred to by a gendered pronoun at all. NIS America deals with this by referring to Subaru in a promotional ad as a "guygirl".
</li><li> The Magypsies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>. Since they lack a gender, they have rather feminine names, have feminine hair, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">wear women's clothing despite the fact that they have facial hair and facial structures like men</a>.

</li><li> All the dogs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DogsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DogsLife">Dog's Life</a></em>, besides Jake and Daisy. They all have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a> and don't interact with Jake much, though you may hear a human refer to a few of them as being male or female (such as Lopez being a girl, the sheep-dog being female, and Snookie apparently being male).

Appropriately, their dominion is over illusions and dreams, so gender is less relevant anyway.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Princes</a> are technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtherworldlyAndSexuallyAmbiguous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtherworldlyAndSexuallyAmbiguous">genderless deities</a>. However, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">take humanoid forms when dealing with mortals</a>. The majority maintain a consistent gender in these forms (ex. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Azura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Meridia</a> as female, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Sheogorath</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">Mehrunes Dagon</a> as male), however, a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">are known to change it up between appearances</a>. For example, Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots, has made three appearances in the series' to date as male and two as female. Boethiah's worshipers and cultists refer to Boethiah as both "he" and "she", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PronounTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PronounTrouble">sometimes in the same sentence</a>. Similarly, Mephala, a Daedric Prince whose sphere is unknown to mortals but who is associated with manipulation, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a>. She is typically referred to as a "she" though, and speaks with a female voice.
</li><li> Captain Viridian in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV">VVVVVV</a></em> is never explicitly assigned a gender. Even when giving (somewhat less-than-fulfilling) romantic advice to a trusted member of their crew, the issue of Viridian's gender is entirely unresolved in any capacity. The retro graphics do ultimately little to help clear anything up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Journey">Journey</a></em>, the mysterious robed player character has no gender.

</div><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cthulhumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cthulhumanoid">Rubbery Men</a> are only referred to as 'men' by convention (the player character occasionally gets an impression that one of them is female, but it's rather difficult to be sure), and the Masters of the Bazaar style themselves as businessmen with names like Mr Cups and Mr Iron but wear all-concealing black hooded cloaks which make it difficult to ascertain either their gender <em>or</em> their species. Both groups are commonly referred to as 'it'.
</li><li> The Muffled Intriguer, a minor character who you mainly interact with when trading Influence items. Their gender is ambiguous mainly because they wear layers upon layers of clothing, which obscures their identity as well.

You decide how your captain's addressed, and gender-neutral options and portraits are available as always. The game also tends to actively avoid using genders for your crew and your captain, too, so as to keep them ambiguous (and in your zailors' case, which pronoun is used is a tossup, your crew has both men, women, and neutral/unknown). Finally, there are multiple characters whose given gender is never referred to, such as the Irrepressible Cannoneer and the Voracious Diplomat, and one overtly ambiguous character in the Alarming Scholar, who makes the narrator constantly struggle when referring to her (him?).

To make matters more confusing, Sabor is referred to as "it" in the novel adaption.
</li><li> Three Dream Eaters, Meow Wow, Meowjesty and Flowbermeow. Their journal entries speak of whether they are male or female, or if they are cat or dog (or chicken in the latter's case). This is also true with most of the other Dream Eaters, but a few, such as the Kyroo triplets, are stated to be male.

Notably, one piece of side material describes Rche as a "<em>[censored]</em>の娘" (<em>no ko</em>, literally "daughter of"); this could be interpreted to mean Rche is the daughter of a character with a one-kanji name, or that Rche is an "男の娘" (<em>otoko no ko</em>, a slang term for a crossdressing male).
</li><li> Shittyghost in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestFantasy">Quest Fantasy</a></em>. He's referred to as a boy in most of the games, but then in Love Plus Shoujo Edition she is inexplicably considered a girl. They're a ghost of a male character, though.

However, one of the hints at the game's loading screen implies that it might be female, though that might be a typo. For added confusion, "Pekka" is a common Finnish male name, which is where the makers of the game, Supercell, originates from.

</li><li> Steve?/Alex?, the player from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, has short hair if you play as Steve?, and long hair if you play as Alex?, but besides that (and the masculine name of "Steve?"), there's no indication whatsoever of the player's gender. Alex? in particular seems purposefully designed to be androgynous. Their name could easily be short for either Alexander or Alexandria, and long hair and skinnier arms are hardly exclusive to women. However, Alex? definitely seems feminine when contrasted with Steve? so a lot of people just assume Alex? is female.

While all versions of Freddy and Bonnie are male, and all versions of Chica are female, Mangle may or may not be a different gender from its predecessor Foxy. Seeing as it's introduced as a barely-functional scrap heap of an animatronic, it's not easy to tell, and its intact Funtime Foxy design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddysWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddysWorld">Five Nights at Freddy's World</a></em> has several elements of its design that conflict with either gender.

Puck has a voice that sounds like it could belong to either a young boy or a girl. Lampshaded if you have the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a></em> announcer, who will sometimes comment on this when Puck is chosen.

The Amalj'aa are an interesting case since they do have males and females, but due to the fact that both sexes look and sound exactly alike and the race don't consider gender identity to be of any importance, it's quite difficult to tell who is what. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that even the Amalj'aa sometimes get confused with identifying each other, but when it's time to mate, their bodies release a unique scent that helps the race identify each other's sex.
<ul><li> Sylphs are another interesting case, they have two distinct subsets that KIND OF count as genders, in the sense that they define their reproductive habits and naming conventions, but neither could strictly speaking be classified as 'male' or 'female', and both types appear feminine by our standards.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LenEn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LenEn">Len'en</a></em> takes this trope and applies it to <em>nearly every single character in the series</em>. Out of a cast of over thirty characters, only one of them (a grandfather of one of the other characters) has a confirmed gender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> the protagonist's gender is unknown, and is referred to as "they" to preserve ambiguity; the same is true of the ghosts except for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mettaton</span> (who seem to be genderless by default), Monster Kid, the River Person (who lampshades it when first met), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the First Fallen Human.</span> This is likely intended to enable players of any gender to relate to the player's avatar.
<ul><li> Monster Kid was originally referred to as "he" in the art book, though this was later edited, and uses masculine pronouns in the Japanese localization. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">Specifically, Ore.</a>) The rest remain ambiguous.

They are called a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a>" and their appearance in the World of Darkness riffs on classic takes on male RPG heroes, but it's still kept intentionally ambiguous.

"The Player" is deliberately left silent and mostly nondescript, as The Player is meant to be <em>you, playing as yourself</em>.
</li><li> TOMCAT, the expert hacker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReadOnlyMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReadOnlyMemories">Read Only Memories</a></em> has no stated gender, and goes by the pronoun "them". Also, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a> Turing has no gender identity either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gigantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gigantic">Gigantic</a></em> has Tyto the Swift, whose identity, including their gender, is unknown to everyone. When the fans asked about Tyto's gender, the developers said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">that even they didn't know what gender Tyto is</a>.
</li><li> Yutani from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubwaySurfers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubwaySurfers">Subway Surfers</a></em> is a kid in an alien costume. For a while, her gender wasn't hinted at aside for lips and eyelashes, until both the web-cartoon and bio confirmed that Yutani is female.
</li><li> It's completely unclear whether the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">player character</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkTales">Dark Tales</a></em> is male or female. Some of the games suggest that it's a male, some suggest it's a female, and the rest make no hints about it either way. This is especially jarring since it's supposed to be the <em>same</em> character in each installment.
</li><li> Demon Lord Ninetails has no clearly defined gender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>. It's unknown if it is male or female. But considering it is a demonic creature with deific power, as well as being a shapeshifter that can take on male and female forms, it is likely genderless. Amaterasu has also stirred confusion, as she urinates with her leg up when using the Golden Fury ability. This confusion likely derives from the common misconception that only male canines can urinate with one leg up. This is more related to the degree of dominance a canine has, rather than its gender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>, Sif the Great Grey Wolf has stirred some gender controversy due to their name (which may or may not be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Gender-Blender Name</a>). The name Sif is a woman's name in most Proto-Germanic languages. It's especially jarring when considering the fact that the English translation of Sif translates to the words "wife" and "bride". There is also a goddess named Sif, who comes from Norse mythology.
</li><li> The character Anri of Astora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">a potential spouse for your character</a> and their gender is consequently set to be opposite that of your own character.

Then again, it's not even clear if they're a single individual, remotely human, or even real either. Only the Archons have met Kyros in person and therefore possibly know Kyros's gender (or in any case what Kyros actually <em>is</em>), but when they are asked about it, they always reply with "Kyros is mother and father." Or, in Sirin's case, switch pronouns randomly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">to screw with the Fatebinder</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">for laughs</a>. It's worth noting that Tunon, Kyros' oldest and most devoted Archon, consistently refers to Kyros with female pronouns, though he gets annoyed if pressed on the matter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> Morgana, one of the party members, has the name of a legendary woman from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> myths, but uses masculine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">Japanese Pronouns</a> and identifies as male. In both the English and Japanese versions, he's voiced by women performing childlike, somewhat-androgynous voices that the game itself describes as "boy<em>ish</em>" (the rest of the party's voices are firmly described as "Boy's voice" or "Girl's voice"). Early in the game there's a dialogue option to guess his gender - saying that he's a girl causes him to get flustered and say he <em>thinks</em> he's a boy. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Maniax Handbook</a> lists his gender as "???".
</li><li> The Dwarf's gender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> seems to have been left up to player interpretation. Though a good chunk of the fandom appears to be guessing that they're male, no pronouns are ever actually used in reference to the Dwarf in-game. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">generic name</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">obscured face</a> only add to the ambiguity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>: The Chevalier d'Eon is extremely androgynous, having traits of both men and women but nothing definitive. The game states that one of the d'Eon's magical abilities is to change their sex whenever they please, and they seem indifferent when the player guesses their gender, whatever the answer is. The game's code considers them "genderless" for gameplay purposes (some abilities and events only affect male or female characters), with a couple of exceptions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters">Moshi Monsters</a></em> has several characters whose genders just aren't revealed, but a notable example is Sweet Tooth-the last person to ask is still hospitalized and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">"wearing a gobstopper"</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em>, the sprite child Popoi has long hair and wears long robes. Popoi was made male for the English version, while the German version treated Popoi as a girl, and the Japanese version using non-gender pronouns. The remake has Popoi voiced by women doing a high-pitched, young voice, and uses the Japanese pronoun 'oira' to refer to themselves, which is generally associated with masculine speech, but can be used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bokukko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bokukko">some women</a>. The English translation of the remake simply chooses to use the genderless 'they' for Popoi.

</li><li> Karma the Chameleon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BestFiends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BestFiends">Best Fiends</a></em> goes by feminine pronouns in her bio, but her gender is also explicitly listed as "unknown", the only Fiend to do so. Some bios end up forgoing pronouns entirely for her as well, or even giving masculine pronouns instead, hinting at a genderfluid nature.

The odd part is that the toy was ostensibly, but not obviously, male. The character profile used male pronouns, but the show writers wanted more female presence. The blurb was rewritten and the character portrayed as female on the show. She was changed <em>back</em> to male in Japan because they thought it might sell more toys. This had some unintended consequences later on, when Tigatron and Airrazor's romance went beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">Implausible Deniability</a>, and the writers just went with it after that. The self parodical <em>Legends</em> manga, aimed at an older audience of <em>Beast Wars</em> and Generation 1 fans, seemingly changed Airrazor back to female - except not actually, instead portraying him as an effeminate crossdresser along with decidedly male <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> character Nightscream for some reason.

The title character's teddybear secretaries, they have distinct feminine voices, wear bows around their necks, and their behavior is mostly feminine, but apparently they have male genitals as they were humping a woman's leg in one episode and they say that they haven't been neutered. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in a later episode where the men and the women are separated from each other and forced to live on opposite sides of the city, but they can't decide on which side Fluffy and Uranus belong on so they make them crossing guards.
</li></ul><ul><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>, in-universe. While she uses she/her pronouns, none of the cast members are sure of her gender. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Kaeloo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a>, but the other characters clearly don't know.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LloydInSpace">Lloyd in Space</a></em>, the characters spend an episode trying to figure out the gender of a new kid named Zoit. When asked about it at the end of the episode, Zoit reveals that members of its (alien) species have no gender until they turn thirteen, at which point they have to decide to be male or female. Zoit chooses a gender, but it's never shown or told which.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill">Mission Hill</a></em>, the gender of Carlos and Natalie's baby was never revealed, and on top of that its name wasn't mentioned at any point in the series; everyone called it "The Baby".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Molang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Molang">Molang</a></em>: The titular Molang and his friend Piu Piu are stated on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> to be neither male nor female, but "beings".
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> had an annoying kid at the zoo informing Alice that the only way to tell a male penguin from a female was with a DNA test. The penguins laugh at his naivety until Alice declares that she only knows they have three males and one female, and "the birds know which is which." All four had been assuming they were all male, leading to a mass identity crisis as they tried to figure it out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> According to their DNA test, all four ARE male. Alice is just uninformed.</span>

However, during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a>, it again sings in a deep bass, though its mouth is never shown to move in sync with the words so it's questionable whether the caterpillar is even singing the song at this point.

Previous and later episodes would indicate that Kodos is male, but in one of the video games Kodos is able to take part in a mission that only female characters can do (while Kang isn't). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> crossover has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCreditsScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCreditsScene">Post Credits Scene</a> where the pair meet Lrrr and Ndnd, who are having a fight. Ndnd runs off, and Lrrr asks "the one of you who is female" to go and console her, and <em>both</em> of them go.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gems appear feminine and are all voiced by women, but that is simply a projection, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">their actual bodies being their gems</a>. "She" and "her" pronouns are used, but Steven regularly refers to them as "guys" and is confused when others use gendered terms about them like sisters or mothers. And while Rose is consistently referred to as Steven's mother Gems usually reproduce asexually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">his conception</a> being completely unique, and they seem to be borrowing Earth terminology. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a> and no human genders. (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw8e1p/">"There are no female Gems. There are only Gems."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> As Steven's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> status makes him the only Gem with a gender at all, him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fusing</a> with anyone but another male human introduces some level of androgyny:
<ul><li> Stevonnie, the fusion of Steven and Connie, has feminine and masculine traits, a voice that could be described as either, and has female and male characters attracted to them. Characters familiar with Stevonnie use "they" pronouns, though it's often ambiguously worded whether said pronouns refer to Stevonnie or Steven and Connie collectively. An online profile Stevonnie makes for themselves in one of the Dove Self-Esteem Project shorts lists them as being non-binary and intersex.
</li><li> Steven's fusion with Amethyst, Smoky Quartz, is also androgynous, has never been addressed by any third-person pronoun in-show, and the show's crews have never specified an appropriate pronoun. However, his other fusions with gems are less androgynous, and the staff have stated "they/them" and gendered pronouns are equally valid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With Sunstone (Steven+Garnet) and Obsidian (all of the main Crystal Gems together), Steven is outnumbered by female-presenting Gems in both cases (as Garnet is herself a fusion), so female pronouns are also OK with both. Obsidian in particular is by far the most feminine-looking of Steven's fusions with other Gems, although less so than when Rose was a component.</span> On the flip side, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rainbow Quartz 2.0 is unique in that he is much more <em>boyish</em> than any of Steven's other fusions, and as such male pronouns are absolutely OK for him. He's even voiced by a man. After all, Pearl <em>has</em> been known to rock a tuxedo.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Alice from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> used to be this for fans until the second season (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> beforehand in a 2009 interview) confirmed her as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> female.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>: Despite being male in the books, Rusty was never referred to by gender-specific pronouns in the TV series and had a rather ambiguous-looking face and persona. This led to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">interesting</a> results when new writers were brought into the series.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> where someone is on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> flat out asking Pat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsPat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsPat">It's Pat!</a></em> is a boy or a girl. Jeremy Hawke just comes from off screen and outs her as a girl and takes off her wig showing she has much longer hair. Pat tells Jeremy that was her whole bit and he has ruined her career. He just states "oh well" and moves on to announcing the opening.

<ul><li> Avatar Portal's Tera253 has a repeated running gag on whether or not he/she is male or female. Even after the user produced "proof" of their gender, it is still a common running gag that the user plays along with.
</li><li> One of PETA's mascots, a chick named Nugget, flip-flops through genders. The site refers to it as male, and some early material with it shows it in a masculine role, but sometimes Nugget has been shown as a girl. His voice is childish and gender-neutral too.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder25');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder25" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Babies. A lot of baby clothing can be gender-neutral, and depending on age and how the parents dress them/cut their hair, it can be difficult to know if a baby or toddler is male or female.
</li><li> The human fetus does not have a distinguishable sex for the first several weeks; during this period, short of genetic testing, sexing a fetus is impossible.
</li><li> The difference sexes of most animals are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism">Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism</a>, or largely indistinguishable unless you take a look at their genitals.
<ul><li> Hyenas have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">matriarchal</a> social structure, the female is bigger and more aggressive than the male, and their genitals are almost identical due to the female's usually high level of testosterone, to the point of making ancient people think they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">Hermaphrodites</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Benders</a>.
</li><li> Birds. Usually, either the male is more flamboyant and colorful than the female, as with peafowl, or they look identical but the female is bigger, as with eagles. However, some bird species lack sexual dimorphism (and the genitalia tend to look identical, given that most male birds do not have an external penis), so the only way to tell some for certain is to get a DNA test. Sexing chicks is a full-time job in chicken hatcheries.
</li><li> In ancient Egypt, due to the fact that Egyptian vultures have almost no sexual dimorphism, it was believed that all vultures were female, and as such, they were revered, because this in turn meant that vultures were all the result of virgin births.
</li><li> Walruses all have thick, bushy whiskers that look like mustaches. Even the babies have them. Both genders also have tusks, as they use them for defense and acquiring food and not in mating rituals like other mammals with tusks and antlers.
</li></ul></li><li> Users on the internet, due to the ease of anonymity. Just because someone has a male or female-sounding name or even refers to themselves as gender specific pronouns means absolutely nothing. This is what started the meme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">There Are No Girls On The Internet</a>.
</li><li> There is a very rare genetic disorder that causes male children to be born with female looking genitals but male brains before they go through puberty, causing them to be unfortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedAsTheOppositeGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedAsTheOppositeGender">Raised as the Opposite Gender</a> until they grow a penis.
</li><li> Transgender people can have this going on from a physical perspective. There are some Trans people who, while they identify with the opposite gender they were born with, still choose to retain certain physical characteristics they were born with (such as a female-to-male getting Breast Reduction surgery, but choosing to keep the vagina he was born with).
<ul><li> Transgender individuals who choose not to have sex-change surgery are referred to a "non-operative" as opposed to transgender individuals who have yet to have a sex-change operation but plan to do so, known as "pre-operative". Be aware that many transgender activists take offense to the use of the term "pre-operative" for any transgender person who has not had sex-change surgery but has not stated whether they plan to do so, as it incorrectly presumes all transgender persons want to have the surgery. If you're not sure what the transgender person's plans are surgery-wise then it's been suggested you include both options such "pre-operative/non-operative (pre-op/non-op) transgender person" rather then just assuming or guessing. Note also though that some self-identified transsexual people object to the umbrella label "transgender" and some self-identified transgender people object to being called "transsexual", further complicating things. Some people use the term "transsexual" to refer only to pre-op/post-op transsexuals, with the term "transgender" being a broader umbrella term including those not wishing to have sex-change surgery, for their issue solely about internal gender identity, rather then external sex characteristics.
</li><li> There are also non-binary and genderqueer individuals. While not all of them will want to present in an androgynous way, or do so all the time (and with many questioning what presenting androgynously would even <em>mean</em>), this can be a deliberate effect that people want to go for. Some people would do this with just clothing, while others may medically transition in a way that would allow them to appear more androgynously.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Polymathically/status/1037450937319677952">This Twitter post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> demonstrates one of the issues that can arise from such an appearance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with people who are intersex. Born a combination between both sexes physically, while they identify as one, the other, or in some cases neither, they can be, say, a woman with a male voice and lower male genitalia, or have any combination of genitalia.
</li><li> In many cases there is significant room for ambiguity as to whether historical people may have been transgender or non-binary, in large part because trans and non-binary issues were frequently not well understood. The French writer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sand">George Sand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (neé Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) is a good example; she was known for flaunting many of the gender norms expected of women in her day, to the extent that her contemporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo">Victor Hugo</a> remarked, "George Sand cannot determine whether she is male or female. I entertain a high regard for all my colleagues, but it is not my place to decide whether she is my sister or my brother." (Although she is less widely known now, Sand was actually the most popular writer in Europe during her lifetime, and Hugo was an immense admirer of her work.) Her gender identity might be regarded as non-binary or gender-fluid today, although it is possible that she was also simply cross-dressing and adopting a masculine appearance to gain increased access to venues to which women were often barred.
