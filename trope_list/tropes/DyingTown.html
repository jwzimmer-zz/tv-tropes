The streets are nearly empty of vehicles, and the grass hasn't been cut around quite a few houses. Quite a few of said houses will have a barking dog tied to a cinderblock, inoperable vehicles and/or appliances in varying degrees of decay rusting on the lawn, possibly some lawn ornaments that are considered "tacky," or holiday decorations unironically left in place even though it's August, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">inhabitants</a> who spend their days sitting out front in cheap plastic lawn chairs with a cigarette perpetually clutched between two outstretched fingers and a cheap beer in the other hand. The local pastime, for many people, is some type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">drug</a> (meth, heroin, crack, whatever the "flavor of the decade" happens to be).

At least not since the rutabaga factory burnt down, or the hot springs dried up, or the Widget Factory sent all its jobs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a>, or Bigville got the freeway exit. The economy, meanwhile, probably hinges on monthly benefits payments, and the local Wal-Mart is likely the de facto town meeting place. The few jobs that do still exist are either part-time and pay minimum wage (or not much more) with no or terrible benefits, or are full-time unskilled labor positions that pay terribly. If there is a decent-paying job available that doesn't require higher education or specialized training, it's probably dangerous, unpleasant, and likely to necessitate an early retirement due to the physical toll that it takes.

Since it sits at the Yodaka side of the bridge to Yuusari (respectively the poor and middle-class regions of Amberground), one would think that it's an important center of commerce, but because the regions are heavily segregated and few people can pass between them, hardly anyone comes through.

The town suffers from an aging population, a struggling economy, local businesses shutting down and few tourists coming through. Unfortunately, the solution is not at all clear-cut, since while many residents agree the situation has to improve, others are apathetic or otherwise resistant to the idea of change. The protagonists in the tourism board's efforts to revitalize the town have some success, but the series ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the town considering a merger</span>, which leaves the future somewhat uncertain.

When the player arrives at Cumbria in the game proper, it's lost nearly all of its power and prestige, and Dernholm itself is a barely held together village whose people desperately try to survive, but have little hope of doing so due to the king's ever-escalating insanity and his sickeningly depraved Guard Captain. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Depending on the player's actions, Dernholm, and Cumbria and general, can begin a slow but sure path to recovery in the epilogue.</span>

Then an earthquake sent 99.9% of the city (and indeed, the Hold itself) into the ocean. No one knows what exactly caused what became known as the Great Collapse, but many people, including the current Winterhold Jarl, believes that the Mage College is connected somehow. Ironically, the College itself is now the only reason anyone still cares about Winterhold. The replacement Jarl (if the Imperials win the Civil War) recognizes the reality of the situation and wants to foster good relations with the College.
<ul><li> Ivarstead is also dying a slow death. One man is reluctant to allow his daughter to go to Riften with her new paramour partly because Ivarstead will have no future if more of the younger generation leaves. The main attraction of Ivarstead is that it is the closest settlement to the mountain where the legendary Gray-beards reside.

<h2>North America</h2>
<ul><li> Dubuque, Iowa, similar to Atlantic City, was this before Iowa legalized riverboat gambling. The revenue of the casinos has clearly gone into the city and it is now a popular tourist destination with its renovated historic sites, the nearby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams">Field of Dreams</a>, and ski resort.
</li><li> Big chunks of rural America are filled with places like this. In the 1870s, over 70 percent of the population worked in agriculture. Today, it's around 3 percent or less. This is mostly due to changes in technology of a hundred different kinds: scientific advances have made farmland much more efficient, transportation technology and infrastructure have made it possible to keep food fresh longer and get it farther in that time, machines do the work of multiple people... so all the people who used to work in rural areas now live in suburban or urban areas, so rural areas are now populated much more sparsely than they once were.
<ul><li> A lot of small farming towns in the Great Plains feature mostly-boarded-up downtowns and an average population age in the 50's or older. Parts of the (much drier) High Plains fared even worse and completed the transition to full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">Ghost Town</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots and lots of former factory towns in the Midwest, including most cities around the Great Lakes (the "Rust Belt"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> are but a few cities whose populations today are half of what they were in the mid-20th century (if that). Even those that have bounced back economically, like Pittsburgh and Milwaukee, still struggle to shed their former image. It's easier to list the exceptions (cities that have never suffered) rather than those that fit:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>, despite losing a quarter of its population since its historic 1950 peak, has held up due to sheer size (third largest city in the USA) and a relatively diversified economy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto">Toronto</a> from being the centre of Canadian finance and media (with a well-timed boost in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> from Quebec's strict language laws, which led to an influx of anglophones and businesses from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a>).
</li><li> Columbus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio">Ohio</a>, since its economy is heavily tied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAThe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAThe">The</a> Ohio State University (the largest single college campus in the US) and the state government rather than any specific industry that would be at the mercy of economic trends.
</li></ul></li><li> Many fishing communities in Atlantic Canada were devastated with the collapse and shut down of the cod fishery. In the decades since, few have been able to come anywhere close to recovering as fish stocks continue to struggle.
</li><li> The Detroit area is an incredible example of suburbs that are completely independent of the city they surround.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis">St. Louis</a>, Missouri used to be this before the city created a massive lower-city cleaning program where they cleaned up and cleared out the lower city. And <em>then</em> local institution Anheuser-Busch was bought out by a Belgian multinational which then proceeded to close the St. Louis bottling plants and fire all the workers.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJsv46c8rw&amp;t=22s&amp;ytbChannel=Precision%20Productions">Gary, Indiana<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a few steps away from being a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">Ghost Town</a>—either that, or Indiana's own mini-Detroit. Either way, not exactly an ideal place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState">Upstate New York</a>, in addition to the usual Rust Belt problems, also had to deal with the loss of the Erie Canal as a viable shipping route after the St. Lawrence Seaway made it obsolete. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rochester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rochester">Rochester</a> was dealt a particularly massive blow around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> because its economy was heavily dependent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EastmanKodak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EastmanKodak">Kodak</a>, which was lethally slow to adjust to the digital photography revolution. Thankfully, it <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/nyregion/despite-long-slide-by-kodak-rochester-avoids-decay.html?_r=1">bounced back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> due to the tech industry and its thriving arts scene, and just in time, as Kodak filed for bankruptcy shortly after the renaissance. Albany, Ithaca, and to a lesser extent Syracuse also survived due to their universities and, in Albany's case, the state government. Unfortunately, many other upstate cities, like Schenectady, Troy, Binghamton, Rome, Utica, and Niagara Falls, were not so lucky. Even Buffalo, which managed to avoid total decrepitude, still has a lot of examples of post-industrial rot scattered throughout the city, its population having fallen by over half.
</li><li> New England sports several of these  all former textile mill towns whose mills either moved or went bust in the mid-to-late 1900s. Some managed to bounce back (Manchester, Nashua, and Worcester being among the better examples), while others (Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee, Lawrence, Lowell, Brockton, Lynn, Fitchburg, and Fall River, all in MA, and Pawtucket and Woonsocket, both in RI) never recovered and are nowadays known for being places that one should avoid at all cost. Like the above-mentioned example of Detroit, however, the suburbs are doing very well in spite of the cities that they service; the Merrimack Valley region does very well despite being home to Lawrence, Lowell, and Haverhill (all of which are known for being highly decrepit and crime-ridden) because of its ties to Manchester and Boston, while the same is also true for Agawam, Longmeadow, and the other suburbs of Springfield and Hartford, both of which are among the poorest and most dangerous cities in the entire Northeast.
<ul><li> Although, Lowell isn't as bad off as a lot of them, due to Tourism brought in by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nps.gov/lowe/index.htm">Lowell National Historic Park<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which preserves the history of Manufacturing in Lowell and the rest of New England, and being the home of one of the state's major Universities, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.uml.edu">UMass Lowell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It only starts to get rough as you head away from the highway and towards Lawrence.
</li></ul></li><li> The Niagara Region in Ontario, much like upstate New York across the river, has been in slow decline since the 1970s. There used to be much manufacturing along the Niagara River and Welland Canal, but cheaper products from elsewhere have caused all but a couple of the factories to go bust. The tourist industry took a major hit in 2001 after 9/11, followed by the SARS outbreak, both of which discouraged the usual American tourists from crossing the border. The area now mostly runs on the casinos, wineries, and agriculture.
</li><li> Towns that base their existence on exploiting natural resources often become these when the resource runs out or becomes obsolete. Examples would be the ghost towns in the Western United States, mining towns in Appalachia, and more mining towns in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
</li><li> Some towns that are forcefully evacuated because their national resource makes them toxic.
<ul><li> In the present day, Libby, Montana is fighting a valiant fight against falling victim to this, in spite of the massive zonolite/asbestos presence that was once in the town. The Superfund project spent about two decades working to clean up the town and now certain pockets of it are livable, though generations of its residents will still succumb to mesothelioma.
</li></ul></li><li> Odessa, Texas' economy is directly tied to the dwindling reserves of oil in the area. Not good. Ditto for its <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights">Friday Night Lights</a></em> stand-in, Dillon.
</li><li> Many of the suburbs in the American "Sun Belt" (the southern third of the country, running from Southern California to the Carolinas and Florida) went from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomTown">Boom Towns</a> to Dying Towns virtually overnight as a result of the 2008 economic collapse. For decades, Americans had been choosing to buy houses somewhere that would be nice, warm, cheap, and sunny to live. Unfortunately, this led to a housing bubble in places that didn't actually have anything else supporting their economic base. Cities like Phoenix, Arizona and Fort Myers, Florida, which were largely nothing <em>but</em> suburbs, have been hit especially hard. Las Vegas survived due to its massive casino-based tourist industry, but it is now surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of pre-built tract houses in the middle of the desert that will probably never sell.
</li><li> In California, entire <em>counties</em> have been brought lowRiverside and San Bernardino counties, for example, were marketed as bedroom communities. They were once touted as <em>the</em> affordable alternative to expensive housing in Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego. The combination of rising gasoline prices (California's strict emissions standards meant the state already had the highest gas prices in the country, even before prices spiked in the mid-2000s), falling housing prices, and the lack of high-paying local employment created a perfect storm for the region, which now suffers from some of the highest crime and unemployment rates in the nation.
</li><li> One California example, <a class="urllink" href="https://grist.org/article/the-true-story-of-the-town-behind-erin-brockovich/">Hinkley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, stands out as the location of the tainted water scandal chronicled in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErinBrokovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErinBrokovich">Erin Brokovich</a></em>. After the events of the movie, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric offered buyouts to the residents on the plume. Many chose to cut their losses, to the point that PG&amp;E now owns about two-thirds of the property in the town. The effect on the local economy is unmistakable.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a>, during the Boeing Bust of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, there was a billboard near the airport that read <a class="urllink" href="https://gilmanpark.wordpress.com/2011/03/24/lights-out-in-seattle/">"Will the last person leaving Seattle - turn out the lights"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It was out of this milieu that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">grunge</a> emerged. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XboxGameStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XboxGameStudios">The city turned itself</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">around pretty quickly</a>, however (Starbucks, Seattle's pride and joy, made coffee a luxury simply by tripling the price), the transition largely completed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> Harvey, Illinois. Home of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/dixie_square_mall.html">Dixie Square Mall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (aka the mall from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers">The Blues Brothers</a></em>), abandoned since 1978. The last portion of Dixie Square Mall was torn down in May 2012. Whether the redevelopment that the city is hoping for actually happens remains to be seen.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherCitiesInTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherCitiesInTexas">San Antonio, Texas</a> was a dying town for most of the first half of the 20th century. Then it was announced the 1968 World's Fair was going to be held there, leading to a surge in development. The Riverwalk came into being, new downtown hotels were built, a convention center sprung up, downtown was transformed from a sleepy hub of shantytowns to a lively center of activity, etc.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schefferville">Schefferville, Quebec<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose economy was based on asbestos mining. When its ore mining stopped in 1982, the population dropped from over 5000 to just a few hundred today. The city temporarily lost its legal incorporation status between 1986 and 1990.
</li><li> Many smaller towns in the Pittsburgh area have been severely crippled by the loss of the steel industry in the 1970s, many of which are along the Ohio and Beaver Rivers. Some of these include towns such as Aliquippa, Ambridge, Beaver Falls, New Brighton, Midland, Monaca (though perhaps not as much), and Freedom- and that's just on the western side of the city. Notable exceptions upon the river include Beaver (the seat of Beaver County), Sewickley (lot of old money here), and Moon (the airport). Since 2000, Aliquippa experienced a 20.5% drop in population, and Ambridge lost 10.1%. However, the area may see some revitalization with a Royal Dutch Shell cracker plant showing up in nearby Shippingport in the next year or two.
<ul><li> A classic example is Sharon, PA, which was made up almost entirely of manufacturing facilities, including Sharon Steel, est. 1890, and was located very close to Interstate 80. After the Sharpsville Dam was built in the 1950s to control flooding, thus cutting off trade by way of the rivers, Sharon relied on their connection to I-80 to transport goods as well as rail lines that ran by select factories. Steel manufacturing declined due to overseas competition, and manufacturing in general declined until the recent economic recession practically crippled the town. Sharon Steel was closed in 1992, and nearly all physical remnants were removed by 1995.
</li></ul></li><li> The vacation destination Salton City, California, suffered greatly when the Salton Sea's slow evaporation and increasing salinity killed its ecosystem and destroyed its tourism industry. The city is full of half-completed houses, abandoned buildings, vacant lots, and roads to nowhere. However, the dirt-cheap land eventually created a housing boom in the area in reaction to California's skyrocketing real estate prices. Its 2010 population was triple that of 10 years previous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars">Cars</a></em> is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to a point. Many towns that had historically banked on the steady traffic from Route 66 became this or even died completely, largely due to the emergence of the interstate highway system combined with other socioeconomic factors. Stories like Radiator Springs were and still are tragically common.
</li><li> A non-industrial example is Kalaupapa, Hawaii, which was founded in 1866 as a leper colony. By 1969, Hansen's disease—aka leprosy—was treatable and better understood, so the state ended its forced exile and moved to close the colony. However, many former patients <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay">wished to stay</a> since they knew their disfigurements would make returning to normal society all but impossible. As a result, the state closed Kalaupapa to new arrivals but has allowed the former patients to live there for the rest of their lives. As of the 2010 census, less than a dozen of the original patients remain (the rest of the town's 88 residents are state and national park employees). When the last of the now-elderly patients moves or passes away, the state plans on turning the colony into a memorial park.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Other</h2>
<ul><li> Many smaller towns on the west coast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia">Peninsular Malaysia</a> were originally founded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Boomtown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Boomtown">Boomtowns</a> for rubber plantations and tin mines during the late 19th and early 20th century; this dependence on single sources of income became their undoing when the price of rubber and, ultimately, tin finally crashed for good, decimating their bread and butter and leading many of its younger talents flocking for greener pastures in larger towns or cities or abroad. The vast majority who chose to stay and contribute to whatever was left of the town's economy are now 50-somethings or older, which is very telling of the future of these towns.
<ul><li> State capitals do not fare better either. The Kuala Lumpur-centric nature of the country's economy after independence naturally sent new job seekers gravitating to the national capital and its surrounding satellite towns, or alternately the state capitals of Penang and Johor or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore">Singapore</a>. The scarcity of free land for new development within old town centres would also prompt developers to construct new suburban towns on the outskirts, taking with it long-time townies who simply favour more peace and quiet. It's thus unsurprising to find capitals for lesser-known states suffering from acute urban decay and desolation, even during festive seasons, when people are supposed to be returning to their hometowns.
</li></ul></li><li> This is an enormous problem in Russia, where there are dozens, if not <em>hundreds</em>, of so-called "single-factory towns". Many of them were built during the mass industrialization in the 1930s and had almost the entire adult population working on some sort of heavy machinery factory or power plant. When the USSR bit the dust, many of the factories were shut down or forcibly bankrupted, leaving entire cities unemployed and rapidly depopulating.
<ul><li> A typical example is Yurievets, Ivanovo Oblast. Once home to several factories, currently all are in ruins or disassembled. The population is half of what it once was and below the official minimum to qualify as a town, and survives on subsistence farming and working shifts in neighboring cities. You can often find abandoned houses if you wander in the streets.
</li></ul></li><li> Former East Germany is infamous for this. Since German reunification, there has been a constant exodus of people from rural areas, small towns, and fairly large cities to move towards the area that was former West Germany. These emigrants are also disproportionately young and women. High rates of unemployment and crime, low salaries, and rising amounts of neo-Nazi activity are all common reasons why people emigrate. It also doesn't help that most of the national economic activity, and large demand for skilled workers, is concentrated along the western parts of the country. What became East Germany wasn't exactly known for being a thriving economic center compared to its western and southern counterparts even before the split. While the trend has reversed recently in the larger and more prosperous areas of the East (Leipzig, Dresden, etc.) or tourist trap towns (Erfurt, Weimar, Potsdam, Stralsund, etc.), the future remains unclear whether the states there would be able to recover demographically.
<ul><li> The aforementioned tourism, thanks to the East controlling an impressive half of Germany's world heritage cities, has given some hope in making these smaller cities prosperous once more while everything else is going to rely on immigrants (which may be hard to do given the East's homogeneity) and making young people stay (which may start working given how cheap the east is compared to the increasingly expensive west and south). Leipzig, former East Berlin and Dresden have begun competing for young people with former West Berlin and Munich in this regard by styling themselves as hip, cheap and great for artsy youth or history lovers.
</li><li> A very special case is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursdorf">Kursdorf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a village <em>in the middle of a major airport</em>. As in, between the two landing strips. Understandably, people are leaving and nobody is moving there.
</li></ul></li><li> This was and to a great extent still is a problem in Britain, which ran its industrial base ragged during the Second World War and was forced to nationalize many heavy industries to prevent their total collapse. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> happened and things got worse. As mentioned above, if you ever visit one of these towns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">do NOT mention</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>.
</li><li> Many coastal towns in Britain began as isolated villages and hamlets until the boom in seaside holidays which started in the middle-late 1800s when the tourist demand caused them to expand into seasonal "must-visit" places based on hotels, boarding houses, and the associated infrastructure. Blackpool, for instance, became a "cheap-and-cheerful" location for nearby industrial cities to send their people on cheap holidays throughout the summer months. This supply-and-demand relationship persisted well into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, until rising affluence and the relative ease of overseas travel opened up cheap, attractive, holidays in sunnier hotspots such as Spain. Suddenly, Rhyl or Skegness or Southend did not seem so attractive for a summer holiday. Go to Rhyl in North Wales now and you find a derelict, crumbling, town with most of its grand seafront boarding houses crumbling or turned into homeless hostels, and tired, dated, seedy, attractions which are relics of its former glory.
</li><li> Many capitals when they cease to be one. Especially when they were built from scratch for no other purpose but to serve as a national capital, often (and rapidly) going all the way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">Ghost Town</a> — e.g. Karakorum, the capital of the Mongol Empire.
</li><li> Right in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, for purely political reasons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Polish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">People's Republic</a>, completely changed its administrative division, going from 17 to <em>49</em> voivodeships.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f1cz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0f1cz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f1cz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(basic unit of administrative division, think provinces or states)</span> Suddenly a lot of provincial towns and small cities were elevated to the position of region's capital and gained central investments, mostly into pompous infrastructure. After the fall of communism merely 14 years later, two-step reform was initiated and in 1999, the country was reorganised back into 16 voivodeships. As for the remaining 33 former capitals, most suffered massive population outflow, dwindling their already small population, while the former seats of administration are at best rented out for office spaces - in most cases, they are just boarded up.
</li><li> There are lots of mining towns in the middle of the Australian bush that previously had populations of thousands or even tens of thousands when the mine was especially large. Now, many are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">completely empty</a>, or have just a few hundred people and a filling station. There are also some towns that had their populations dwindle to almost nothing after trains stopped coming that way.
</li><li> Many towns around the Aral Sea, like <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moynaq">Moynoq<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, had populations of thousands employed in the fishing industry. Now, due to the Aral Sea shrinking, many of these towns are located miles from the nearest shore; <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aralship2.jpg">fishing boats<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AralShip.jpg">ships<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> lie scattered on the dry land that was once covered by water. Ongoing desertification and unemployment led to depopulation and a decline in living conditions of these who decided to remain.
<ul><li> Much of Central Asia suffered this fate centuries ago after the trade routes known as the Silk Road were bypassed by the circum-African seaborne links between Europe and South/East Asia. The overall effect was akin to the fate of towns bypassed by upgraded highways writ large.
</li></ul></li><li> Many rural communities in Japan that have no tourism to thrive on suffered from heavy population loss. This is mostly caused by the combination of closing of industries, young adults migrating to major cities for career, education, and cultural opportunities, and low birth rates leaving mostly the elder population.
</li><li> There are some towns, such as Haapamäki, in Finland, which were built near some railway route and most people there used to work for VR (the national railway company). Then VR centered things to bigger cities.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia">Armenia</a>, there are a lot of these outside of the capital Yerevan. Towns devastated by the 1988 earthquake in the north have it the worst, although most of the buildings have been rebuilt. Other towns that were big tourist spots in Soviet times like Dilijan have seen business dry up since independence from the Soviet Union. And villages along the border with Azerbaijan have shrunk due to the dangers posed by ceasefire violations in the ongoing conflict over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RepublicOfArtsakh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RepublicOfArtsakh">Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh</a>. People from small villages across the country are leaving in large numbers to the cities, or worse, to Russia or the US.
</li><li> This is a major problem in some regions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1y1s5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1y1s5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1y1s5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Teruel, Soria and Asturias to cite some</span> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain">Spain</a> as villages and towns are depopulated by young people who move to the cities looking for employment and a better life, leaving mostly elderly people behind.
