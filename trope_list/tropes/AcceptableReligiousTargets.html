</div></div><p>A subset of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>. This section refers to people whose beliefs are, well, apparently corny. Ultimately, there is absolutely no form or collection of beliefs that is not parodied somewhere. The lack of spiritual beliefs is also exposed to ridicule, as is spiritual neutrality (eg; agnosticism). Specific forms examples follow, but we could probably just go with "everybody" and stop right here.

<p>In the Anglosphere's modern history (as well as the Internet's), Christianity is arguably the most mocked religion in mainstream media.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qfk0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qfk0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qfk0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is not without precedent; on this very wiki alone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">The Bible's page had to be locked against edits due to disproportionate amount of edit wars and flame wars it was subject to; a measure as yet unnecessary for the tropes pages of other religious texts such as the Qu'ran.</a></span> The basic truth is that Christianity, in all its sects, is the world's major and leading religion, it is the dominant religious tradition in the Western nations and Western nations have a disproportionate hold on the global media, so Christianity's perceived negatives at times get over-represented or exaggerated. Likewise, Christianity did not become the world's leading religion by accident. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope John Paul II</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nostreradici.it/forgiveness.htm">himself noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a 2000 prayer seeking forgiveness for the dark parts of Church history: <em>Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions: be patient and merciful towards us, and grant us your forgiveness!</em> A lot of these actions were criticized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReformist">even by Christians</a> in the past, and there are parts of Church history, most modern Christians, regardless of the sect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">are not proud of</a>. Christianity being a large diverse religion has also been involved in several questionable policies and events over the centuries (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition">The Spanish Inquisition</a>). It is often criticized among other religious groups for its missionary activities, wars it has waged among various sects, its role in suppression and hijacking of pagan rituals and persecuting other religions (which is not exclusive to Christian or Abrahamic faiths, as instances are common among many religions).
</p><p>In Eastern nations, in former colonies, Christianity may be a minority but on account of missionary activities it has greatly impacted the education and cultural life of the elites, which has nonetheless kept Christian tradition and its roles, positive and negative, in public memory. The political and cultural revolutions on behalf of freedom of speech in France, England, United States, Italy, Germany has rested on the separation of the Church and State, and this has led to Christianity in the position of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a> in many anti-censorship fights in the Western World, which thanks to colonialism and imperialism, has made this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a> for the entire world. Christianity was perceived, and resented for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> on account of its historical association with censorship (the Vatican Index, Galileo, Darwin), its lack of permissiveness and anti-LGBT policies. A lot of this is true for all religions. (For instance, general prudishness, censorship, homophobia exist even among Buddhists and even the Roman pagans were pretty uptight about other issues.) Since Christianity has been historically the religion with the greatest political and historical clout, and since those fights were ultimately <em>won</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy">this tends to get associated with Christianity</a> to the point that such aggressive and controversial actions have been used to smear all Christians by association, at times even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">long (e.g. ''centuries'') after the Christians involved in said controversies died</a> (though this has also happened to people of all religions).
</p><p>Christianity has at times been criticized by other Christians, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamGreeneAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamGreeneAuthor">Graham Greene</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">for failing to live up to the teachings of the faith</a>. The Anglican Priest, Fr. Charles Kingsley even echoed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> when he noted, "We have used the Bible as if it were a mere special constable's hand book, an opium dose for keeping beasts of burden patient while they were being overloaded, a mere book to keep the poor in order".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1src0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1src0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1src0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A recurring theme is the hypocrisy in worshiping a man who claimed peace, condemned greed, befriended prostitutes and the downtrodden yet opposing any reform or revolution, being critical of sexuality and persecuting prostitutes and homosexuals as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, supporting Kings, Aristocrats and Businessmen, and sparking various wars of conquest.</span> Satire and criticism of Christianity in non-Christian media often (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo">but not always</a>) separates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool">Jesus</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodBeforeDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodBeforeDogma">the actions of various Christian sects</a>. As such, the defining criticism of Christianity is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy">Hypocrisy</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24jps');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24jps" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24jps');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere">Molière</a>'s <em>Tartuffe</em>, a con-man who poses as a priest, a proverbial byword for two-faced corruption </span>; while obviously not exclusive to Christianity, or to religion in general, it's nevertheless a strong charge and criticism to a faith missionary in origin that keeps asserting it is the one true faith and often promises a better life for its flock.
</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Catholics</a></strong>:
</p><p>The Catholic Church has a checkered history and it gets satirized more often because it <em>is</em> the biggest and oldest church and certainly the world's oldest institution, the only organization in Europe that was formed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>. Within Europe, the Church is still regularly mocked, though there the criticism is political, citing the Church's involvement in politics and its opposition to republican and leftist revolutions, and it is still mocked to death in most Western European countries such as France and Spain (the latter of which still has the ghost of the very Catholic Franco dictatorship on it s back). Likewise, they aren't all that popular even in Italy, what with the Italian drug mafia giving them regularly big enough sums of money to lead locals to say that the mafia is a Catholic charity and that their actions are so noble that they will receive heaven, something they only started to contradict as of 2013, when Pope Francis excommunicated the Mafia.
</p><p>Within America, anti-Catholicism has had an old and at times dubious history, and for a long time, Catholics especially from immigrant countries like Ireland and Italy endured some amount of persecution from the largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant">WASP</a> American mainstream. The election of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> was seen as the point where Catholics were embraced by the white mainstream. This was tarnished however by the revelation that parts of the Church hierarchy were complicit in covering up child abuse by their own priests, and a growing trend has been to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">depict most or all Catholic priests as being child abusers and pedophiles</a>. Catholicism is also commonly portrayed as the ultimate in fundamentalism<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3rehk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3rehk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3rehk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Christian theology, "Fundamentalism" means something a little more involved than "stuff that's really, really bad," and by definition it's mutually exclusive with Catholicism.</span> and hypocrisy, as a group of people who judge others despite being evil and cruel. Catholic girls are portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolGirlsRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolGirlsRule">as easy and slutty</a> but judgmental and bitchy. Catholics have been portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">enemies of science</a> ever since they put Galileo under house arrest (the church didn't officially apologize for the Galileo affair until <em>1990</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note421lq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note421lq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note421lq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although Galileo's works were removed from the Holy Index within a century after his death, and the Church formally accepted his heliocentric theory in 1800-about the same time that direct experimental evidence for the Earth's motion in space was first presented. Galileo's rehabilitation had actually been in the works for centuries and would have occurred much earlier were it not for intervening political events.</span> Catholics aren't supposed to use birth control, and stereotypical Catholics have enormous families, presumably because they're too dumb to simply stop having sex when they already have more children than they can feed (and this brings up supposed sexual hypocrisy, of course).
</p><p>However, North American lay Catholics get more of a pass now since the Vatican's frustration at the vast majority casually defying its directives on things like birth control and divorce is well-known. John Paul II helped soften the Pope's image in United States, mostly because he was tough on Communism, and even non-Catholics tend to think of modern Popes as basically nice guys, though Pope John Paul's successor Benedict XVI's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">interesting German background</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition">previous religious occupation</a> and resemblance to a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Dark Lord of the Sith</a> hasn't helped. However, <em>his</em> successor (after Benedict's resignation/retirement, the first one since <em>1415</em>) has been lauded for his comparatively progressive style yet not falling into the traps of hypocrisy or compromise, particularly when it comes to discussing faith and religion with non-Catholics and, indeed, non-Christians.
</p><p>One common mistake with Catholicism is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Christianity Is Catholic</a>. The heavy ritualization and rich saint folklore of the Church often make it more artistically appealing than other religious sects and as such in popular culture and general conversations, the Catholic Church is often accused of actions that are more specifically the actions of other sects, mostly because the latter are perhaps visually dry. For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">witch burning</a> was a largely Protestant affair, and it took place in predominantly Protestant nations. Catholics further point out that unlike the English Protestants who forbade women from acting in the Elizabethan Stage, it was Catholic countries like Spain and France that allowed and welcomed women into the performing arts, and that it was only when Charles II, exiled in France, returned to England (and who on his deathbed converted to Catholicism), that women were allowed to act on the British stage. Likewise, the Catholic Church has accepted and supported <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin">Charles Darwin</a> and evolution and has never voiced any significant criticism and political opposition against it. It has also denounced Creationism, even though some lay Catholics have adopted it. Indeed, Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics and one of the two pillars of the modern evolutionary synthesis, was a Catholic friar himself.

<p>There are two versions of Christian Orthodoxy. (The first was Eastern Orthodoxy, which accepts Seven Councils up to the Council of Chalcedonian prior to 1054 while most of Oriental Orthodoxy accepts Three Councils up to the Council of Ephesus, with each of them having different theology from the others.)
</p><p>Eastern Orthodoxy is like a more radical brother of Roman Catholicism in a historical sense due to connections they had as part of Chalcedonian Christianity until their Great Schism<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53ni5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53ni5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53ni5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is when the Patriarch of Constantinople had enough with the Papacy and split the denomination into two, renaming the Patriarch of Constantinople to Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.</span> caused them to permanently split and still is to this day and considered as an ethnoreligion for most all Eastern Europeans like Greeks or Russians.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note657ty');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note657ty" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note657ty');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While it was part of Russian culture until the 20th century, when the Soviet Union demoted it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary">evil religious people who hate Communism</a>.</span>
</p><p>The appearance for their spiritual leaders and clergy is like normal Catholic priests/nuns except for the major differences that men have the option to grow beards and the regular priests wear all black except for sometimes having a chef-like white hat with the Orthodox cross in the center to present the high power of the denomination. Their Patriarchs look like the Pope but have a more with Byzantine-style attire or others have their own depending on the culture, such as Russian Patriarch having almost a Russian style, and for women/nuns they look largely unchanged from Catholic nun except their habits are <em>pure black</em> with the Orthodox cross on their forehead.
</p><p>Oriental Orthodoxy is a completely foreign denomination for Westerners. It's only known as the Copts, Armenians, West Middle Easterners, a small portion of Indians and Ethiopians religion. Their holy leaders have similar dress to Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism except their hats have weird designs that resemble inflated cakes and they don't share the same beliefs with mainstream Western Christian and a couple Eastern Christian denominations.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7566x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7566x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7566x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They believe in Miaphysitism where Christ is one incarnate nature that is both human and divine. However, Chalcedonian Christians have stated they find this view compatible with theirs, in contrast to the Monophysitism of other Oriental Orthodox Christians, positing that Christ had only one nature, a divine or largely divine one.</span>

They also are known for not drinking tea, coffee, or alcohol, something considered unthinkable by many. Like African-Americans, it's claimed that Mormons give their children absurd made-up names.

</li></ul><p></p><hr/><p><strong>The Amish</strong>
</p><p>As well as other Anabaptists (Mennonites, Hutterites, Baptist Brethren, Plain Quakers, and others), not because they are often considered worthy of scorn but simply because, as they isolate themselves from popular culture and modern technology, including television and the Internet, and so are not in a position to become aware of any slights made against them. Because of said isolation and their old-fashioned lifestyles, many mock them as being backward and simple, though only, of course, in forms of media they do not read.
</p><ul><li> Amish have a lot of other problems that are more or less ignored: the practice of shunning or genetic difficulties (such as six fingered dwarves) because of the founder effect; markedly higher levels of child sexual abuse, and excessive inbreeding due to failures to use exogamy, even with Amish of other villages. It's also notable that Amish are not entirely Luddites, only that new technology has to be approved first to make sure it does not interfere with religion.
<ul><li> Due to the way that the church hierarchy functions, where the actual line between "interference" is drawn varies from community to community. For example, in some areas, an Amish home may utilize an electric generator, batteries, propane, kerosene-powered refrigerators, or thermal solar collectors. It should be kept in mind that pretty much no Amish sect views technology as <em>inherently</em> evil.
</li><li> The Amish are more or less only against technology that does not have primarily work-related purposes. Hence, a truck to bring the harvest to your local wholesaler might be alright, but a nice comfy Volvo station wagon just to ferry your family to church is not so alright. Or a weather-radio <em>might</em> be okay to stay abreast of severe weather alerts, but not a TV set (and certainly not a TV set that's connected to cable or satellite). A barebones-basic home telephone located in a not-so-convenient area of the house, or only set up to make and receive calls to certain numbers might be permissible, but not smartphones for each family member with all the bells and whistles. A horse-and-buggy might be allowed for getting around town, but not a minivan for taking extended road trips. A DSL or dial-up Internet connection might be allowed for work or school-related purposes, but not a broadband connection for watching cat videos, social media...or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">porn</a>. And in many cases, medical devices (such as an oxygen tank for O2 therapy, or a CPAP machine for obstructive sleep apnea, or a home blood-pressure-measuring machine to keep an eye on hyper/hypotension) <em>are</em> allowed. Which is not so bad, after all...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson">Craig Ferguson</a> often says that the only group you can make fun of on TV is the Amish. The reason he gives is that they don't watch late night TV.
</li><li> Some Mennonite groups believe in the core tenet that people shouldn't "yoke themselves to unbelievers" and therefore are okay with solar panels and other modern things, as long as they needn't buy them from factories and can stay "off the grid" while using them.

(1) They do not believe Jesus is God; instead, they believe that he is the first and greatest being God created, a version of Christianity called "Arianism" after the 4th-century theologian Arius, who argued this position against the Trinitarian position of Athanasius. However, this is not a small doctrinal distinction, since it involves rejecting what most Christians consider to be <em>the</em> core teaching of Christianity. (2) They do not believe in the standard Heaven-and-Hell Christian afterlife system. Instead, they believe the dead simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">cease to exist</a>.

</p><ul><li> Jehovah's Witnesses have no secret beliefs, and are more than happy to talk about them; if you actually want to know what they believe, it's not that difficult to find out. In fact, the jokes are more often about trying to get them to keep their beliefs secret when they come knocking.
</li><li> What is known about them is pretty funny to some. They stay politically neutral. They preach door to door. Some find this as harassment. They don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas due to its origins. They also don't accept blood transfusions due to them following a Bible text that says to abstain from drinking blood.
<ul><li> The general idea of the Witnesses is to live by Biblical values considered by them to be of divine origin, and to discuss with others how these values can benefit everyone, hence the name. By personal experience, these conversations touch upon different topics, from history, science, moral values, philosophy, political science, literary analysis, current events, family life, and the Bible. The Bible touches on all these topics (e.g.: Job, Daniel, Matthew).
</li><li> Harassment is what it seems like if you go out of your way to <strong>avoid</strong> talking to them, because they keep coming back until they get a hold of you. If you actually speak to them and ask them not to come back, they put you on a list of people to stay away from. The rest of that is all true.

</p><p>Unitarians, though a relatively small religious group, tend to get poked fun of primarily for "believing nothing" and "questioning everything". This is a gross over-simplification of the modern Unitarian avoidance of dogma and strict religious rules that other religions have.

It also helps that Unitarians tend to laugh louder than anyone at the jokes. It doesn't help that few people know what the heck a Unitarian is, even though it was a prominent Christian sect of the 19th Century (and three Presidents were counted as members). Psst: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unitarian Universalism is a merging of two churches. Unitarianism is the belief in a unified Christian God rather than a Trinity: Universalism is that every person will be saved</span>.
</p><p>Despite the comparatively laid-back nature of the religion, Unitarians can attract some genuine rancor-either from other Christians accusing Christian Unitarians of not being real Christians, or Atheists assuming that Christian Unitarians share the same beliefs and attitudes of any other Christians. Many Unitarians aren't Christians (no dogma, remember) and some are even atheists.

</p><p>Interestingly, Henry VIII's official declaration of the Church of England was, while of course related to divorce, a final move in a several-century game of poaching control of national churches from one another by popes and kings. Strictly speaking, since the old Roman church withered to nothing in the Dark Ages and the pope at Rome only started recentralizing after the institution general was healthy again, the pope poached first. Medieval kings of England had control over things like appointing bishops, and never quite felt they'd lost the right.

Expect tiny churches, beige decor, lots of small-town gossip, big zany hats, rehashing of generic WASP stereotypes...and less emphasis on actual religion than on squeaky-clean socializing, usually involving a carnival (not necessarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrappyCarnival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrappyCarnival">a crappy one</a>, but pretty boring in either case), a picnic (with men wearing straw hats and ladies playing croquet if a work is set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayNineties">Gay Nineties</a>) or a potluck supper organized by lodge brothers in those funny "Turkish" hats; watch vintage live-action Disney movies or "family" films from the 1950s or '60s if you want to see these stereotypes in action.

The worst of these preach what's known as "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology">Prosperity theology<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which holds that physical and financial well-being is a sign of God's favor - if you're wealthy, God loves you!

<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Jews</a></strong>
<p>It's been noted, with only marginal hyperbole, that one could count on one hand all the positive depictions of Jewish culture and Jewish people made by non-Jews before the 20th Century. Ironically enough, the most famous was Gotthold Lessing's <em>Nathan the Wise</em>, written in German (which was for obvious reasons, revived in a prominent production after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>). After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> revealed the harmful consequences of centuries of religious bigotry, open anti-Semitism is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets">no longer acceptable</a>, and in some places is proscribed by law as a hate crime. The de-ghettoization of Jews in the 19th and early 20th Century also led to a renaissance in Jewish culture which has led to aspects of Jewish culture and jokes entering the mainstream. This led to a range of relatively harmless stereotypes, mostly revolving on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue">Jews Love to Argue</a> and the complexity of Rabbinical discourse.
</p><p>In the Middle East and Eastern Europe, anti-semitism remains common and in some cases is even on the rise. There it has more to do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">ArabIsraeli Conflict</a> and resentment over military defeats and perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> on the part of the West, in feeling guilty over anti-semitism and Jewish persecution rather than colonialism in the region. Among Eastern Europeans anti-semitism endures for a variety of complex reasons revolving around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell">Why We Are Bummed Communism Fell</a>. Since Israel has an active media as well, there the tension is between Secular Jews and Orthodox and Religious Jews.
</p><p>It should be noted that Jews are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableEthnicTargets">Acceptable Ethnic Targets</a>, and are often represented as Hasids with big beards, peyes, and huge noses.

So far, so BBC Light Entertainment. But the North London suburb is somewhere in the Golders Green/Finchley area. (Which instantly paints a picture to British people: Golders Green is synonymous with British Judaism). Sure enough, the house is haunted. By Yetta Goldberg, its previous owner. Who stands there impassively as a Christian exorcism is conducted, remarking "Oi vey, have you got the wrong ghost". Over the three series, Yetta becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother">Jewish Mother</a> from Beyond The Grave to her adopted goyim family.

One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">particularly self-perpetuating</a> one is that they are overly sensitive, and can't take any criticism without screaming "Anti-Semite!"
<ul><li> Any actual Jew will probably fall victim to several of these at the same time, including the ones that contradict each other. The same person can be a bleeding-heart liberal to a Southerner and a blood-drinking Zionazi to a San Franciscan.
</li><li> Of course, one mustn't assume that North Americans who hold these stereotypes are actually expressing <em>disapproval</em>. After all, one man's nerd is the other man's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a>, and one man's bloodthirsty Zionist warmonger is another's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli">Badass Israeli</a>.
</li><li> The "religion card" aspect has become more and more of an issue as of late thanks to increasingly common criticism of Israel's less-than-stellar human rights track record, as it has become a very difficult-to-approach topic due to a tendency to lump any criticism of Israel in with garden-variety anti-Semitism, as well as shooting down the opinion any actual Jews who display anti-Israel sentiment as being the ramblings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">"self-hating Jews"</a>.
</li><li> This gets made even more complicated by the fact that there are quite a few legitimate antisemites that attack Israel because it's populated by Jews, rather than any actual concern for Israel's policies. Criticism of Israel often gets accused of being merely cover for this, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">double standard</a> compared to countries with much worse human rights records.
</li></ul></li><li> Within Judaism, Conservative Jews often get flak from both sides: Orthodox Jews (see above) for not being strict enough, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews for being too wishy-washy.
<ul><li> This is because "Conservative Judaism" covers the broad range between Orthodox and Reform, and is literally defined as being all the varying degrees between the two.
</li></ul></li><li> A stereotype that has a tendency to come up semi-frequently is having a Jewish character be marked as Jewish because they always wear a yarmulke. Only fairly Orthodox Jews actually bother to wear them outside of religious services.
</li></ul><p></p><hr/><p><strong>Ultra-Orthodox Jews</strong>:
</p><p>The ones about Jews are sort of true by a bizarre self-reinforcement effect. The Ultra-Orthodox Jews spend a <strong>lot</strong> of time and money telling all the other Jews that the only proper expression of Jewish culture, history, or heritage is an Orthodox lifestyle.

</p><p>It has also become an acceptable target among some leftists and some liberals in recent times, mostly as a fallout of the New Atheism movement where there is a contentious debate about Western criticism of Islam as a religion, and to the degree it is legitimate to satire and lampoon aspects of Islam especially when that criticism will largely be seen by a non-Muslim audience. As a result of the backlash against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses">The Satanic Verses</a></em>, the Jyllands-Posten controversy and most tragically, the Charlie Hebdo shootings, Muslims are perceived as a religious version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>: "If you're going to badmouth them, do it privately and very quietly; otherwise, they'll kill you."

</p><p>Usually, they're portrayed as all brown-skinned Arabs (or, occasionally, black Africans). So, if you're a white Muslim—a convert, or an Albanian or Bosnian, for example, or perhaps an Arab or Turk of partial Caucasian or Eastern European descent (there are a lot of those)—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">you officially do not exist</a>. The same goes for Central Asian, East Asian, and Southeast Asian Muslims, despite the fact that three largest Muslim population nations (Indonesia, Pakistan, India) are not Arabic nations, culturally and ethnically, and in the case of India, not even a Muslim majority nation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13dmk2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13dmk2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13dmk2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Muslims form a minority of 172 million in India, which by the way is more than the population of Russia and Japan, <em>in toto</em>, but since this is India, a nation of over one-billion, that makes them a minority to the 900 million Hindu majority.</span> The former Soviet Central Asian Republics were all nominally-Muslim with traditionally-Asian-looking populations, and China has a surprisingly large Muslim community, as well. Despite attempts to mount <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">a big backlash against this</a>, the trope still persists, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> and ethnic strife in the Middle East remains a major geopolitical headache in the world.
</p><p>Even before 9/11, a common portrayal of a Muslim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale">male</a> is that of a religious fanatic and sexist who wants nothing more than to spit on the American flag, cover up his wife (or wives), and chant threats in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">some Middle Eastern language</a> (that is, if he's not making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">himself and everything around him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">go boom</a>): however, 9/11 was followed by a rise in the aforementioned type of negative stereotyping. About the only positive representation of Islam in American culture before that, was perhaps Malcolm X. His controversial image was seen as a result of him being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan">Angry Black Man</a> rather than a Muslim, and of course for the fact that he moderated after leaving the Nation of Islam, an American sect, in favour of mainstream Sunni Islam.

Mr Khan was xenophobic, pompous, and pretty much an Asian Alf Garnett - he found it hard to believe a white Brit could be a proper Muslim, for instance, and looked down on Muslims who weren't Pakistani.

Sound a bit much? Check this: The series (and therefore the character) began <em>before</em> 9/11, and ended shortly after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. As a matter of fact, the character and his story was written in response to the behavior of the U.S. towards Iraq in between the Gulf Wars, especially in the 1990s. The significance of Osama's name is unknown, because he is never named in the series, and so the timing is difficult to tell.

It survives and is a major world religion with a billion plus adherents. It survived while other polytheistic faiths in Mesopotamia to Central Asia, the Middle East, Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Germanic and Slavonic paganism faded away at least in their classical form. This is because for most of its history, it was concentrated on the Indian Subcontinent and relatively isolated from the rest of the world. It only became known across the world during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a>. Stereotypes about Hinduism often overlapped with colonialist and imperialist-era racism, a fact that Hindus are extremely touchy about to this day, because in their eyes, most Western portrayals of their faith, whether positive or negative, is at best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a> and worst, on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a> of writers simply using old Imperial stereotypes (a side-effect of American Anglophilia), indistinguishable from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">colonialist propaganda</a>.
</p><p>Most portrayals in the West from the Victorian to the modern era, emphasize and focus on the seemingly bizarre nature of the faith, like the idolatry, the heavy ritualization and the perceived remoteness. Aspects of Hinduism are often conflated with Buddhism with many portrayals, even the positive ones, going on about finding Nirvana while chanting some pseudo-Hindu prayers. Nirvana is a largely Buddhist concept, the Hindu one is Moksha. Likewise, their pantheon is populated by countless <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Avatar">avatars</a></em> (that's physical manifestations of gods, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">blue-striped monkey aliens</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">masters of all the elements</a>!) that resemble unusual animals and various grotesque multi-armed beings. There's also the fact that Hinduism is more a collection of various beliefs and rituals with immense regional variations.
</p><p>The close association with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">1960s</a> counterculture (thank you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a>) is also a liability. Victorian era fiction made much about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImmolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImmolation">sati</a> and the Thugee cult, and of course the British needed some specially reprehensible practise to scapegoat an entire culture, never mind that neither were widespread or generally representative, or without criticism from within. Some people still argue that this is practised and ongoing in India, despite the fact that the Indian government has put a stop to that sort of thing and it is entirely illegal.
</p><p>Portrayals of Hinduism is often associated with a range of stereotypes about India, despite the fact that Hinduism spread far and greatly syncretized in nations like Indonesia, Cambodia, the Fiji and even the Caribbean Islands (as a result of migrant workers settled there by the English). Another stereotype that is a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Everybody Hates Hades</a> treatment of Kali. Kali is a popular goddess in India, especially in Bengal, and she is associated with a range of positive qualities and her symbolism of death is meant to indicate acceptance and transition.
</p><p>Other stereotypes, especially in India, have to do with caste, with Indian intellectuals like B. R. Ambedkar arguing that it was an inherent part of the faith while others point out that since there was rarely an organization enforcing a common program unlike other faiths, this varied with region and time and place. The bigger issue is vegetarianism, where many Indians, find the stereotype in the West about vegetarians being pacifist and tolerant types hilarious on account of the often nasty and violent tensions that flare up across India, with various governments trying to enforce vegetarianism by force and forbidding Christians and Muslims from eating meat or restricting it. As Empire history buffs know, the fact that some cartridges may have been coated with animal fat was one of the reasons for the bloody 1857 Mutiny among its own Sepoys, so it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> indeed.
</p><p>On account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken">Flawless Token</a>, some negative aspects of Hinduism is entirely forgotten or neglected. For instance, many assume that it's a religion of non-violence like Buddhism, on account of the world's most famous Hindu, and most famous Indian, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, forgetting that the latter was not a mainstream Hindu in his time and afterwards, confirmed by the fact that he was assassinated by a Hindu zealot. Indian media, thanks to government censorship, generally walks on eggshells around Hinduism, but even then Hindu fundamentalists are generally regarded with scorn as being fanatic saffron-wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">Lower-Class Lout</a> misogynists who want to dial the clock back as far as possible. For some reason, extremist Hinduism hardly receives some of the same approbation from Western critics of Islam, despite the fact that it shares much of the same defects (sexism, hypocrisy, victim-blaming, and intolerance of criticism) as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage">Monumental Damage</a> (such as the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1991, which preceded the Taliban destruction of the Buddha statues and the stuff that ISIS got up to in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>). This is likely because, outside of South Asia, Hinduism (and thus fanatical Hindus) barely exists, in contrast with Islam or Christianity, as they both are global religions.

</p><p>Eastern Buddhists are certainly subject to stereotyping like any other group, but for the most part, western media takes it pretty easy on them due to their perceived emphasis in peace and spiritual ascetism. Indeed, sometimes their portrayal as peaceniks overlooks the fact that plenty of Buddhist countries are also proud warrior cultures, with wars against other faiths and persecution of them having occurred.
</p><p>Western converts, on the other hand, are given far less mercy. Expect them to be universally portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">New Age Retro Hippies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BourgeoisBohemian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BourgeoisBohemian">Bourgeois Bohemians</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">granola girls/guys</a>, when not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">hypocritical poseurs</a> who adhere to a faith they don't understand in the search of moral superiority.
</p><p>In Japan, Buddhism acquired a somewhat sleazy image in the 80s thanks to some highly publicised scandals involving the financial misdeeds of major sects. Buddhist clergymen in Japanese fiction tend to be characterized as either humorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">drunkards</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">dirty old men</a> (in comedic works) or creepy, corrupt priests with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">hidden twisted desires</a> (in more serious works, especially horror-oriented). The boom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo">Onmyōdō</a> fiction often featured all of those traits in both heroic and villainous characters, and it helped to cement the impression that Japanese Buddhists are less-than-holy people that spend their time doing weird stuff.
</p><p>It doesn't help either that Japanese Buddhism has somewhat of a reputation <em>not</em> to observe closely the rule about celibacy, which includes prostitution and ancient traditions of master-disciple homosexual relationships (called <em>nenja</em> and <em>chigo</em>). This attracted harsh criticism from Christian missionaries the 16th century and was the cause of a lot of ribald humor in medieval Japan's pop culture, even spawning an entire genre of comedy named <em>chigo monogatari</em>.

</p><ul><li> Sometimes, Buddhism is portrayed as very peaceful and more like a philosophy, when, in fact, it can (and <em>has</em>) been fanatical when it wants to be — look at Japanese and Chinese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">warrior monks</a> in history, for example, and Japanese Buddhism's coercion and involvement in the massacre of Japanese Christians in the 1600s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> warped the teachings of Zen and other Mahayana traditions to justify militarism and imperialism during the early and mid-twentieth century, and Japanese temples tended to openly support Japanese jingoism. More recently, many South East Asian countries have seen a wave of Buddhist nationalism in recent decades, such as the controversial 969 Movement in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThatSouthEastAsianCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThatSouthEastAsianCountry">That South East Asian Country</a>. Most of these factions are <em>officially</em> nonviolent, but have been accused of inspiring and participating in incidents of anti-Muslim mob violence and persecution of certain non-Buddhist ethnic groups within the region.
</li><li> There's also this whole worldwide cult of respect for the Dalai Lama, which often rests on a simplistic and touristy vision of Tibet informed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostHorizon">Lost Horizon</a></em>, rather than, as the Dalai Lama himself has admitted, a feudal theocracy that included legal slavery and mutilation/blinding of serfs, which he had attempted to reform before the invasion of Communist China. The Dalai Lama himself has avoided reflexive anti-communism but that doesn't stop people from invoking Tibetan Buddhism as a Shangri-La.
</li><li> Westerners who adopt Buddhism are often portrayed as trendy, shallow, credulous yuppies who swill $7 coffee drinks and call their therapist to reschedule while they drive their Volvos to yoga class, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">you know totally embracing</a> the rejection of materialism at the core of Buddhism.
</li><li> Additionally, Westerners only convert to Zen or maybe Tibetan Buddhism; Souka Gakkai International does not, apparently, exist. It doesn't help that many such people take up yoga (which is actually Hindu, not Buddhist) only for the physical benefits it bestows, rather than the spiritual ones. From well-known Hindus who object (e.g., Aseem Shukla), the criticisms usually deal with appropriation of religious activities to serve secular (or even New Age) purposes, and is probably more comparable to certain well-known Christians' criticism of the secularization of Christmas. Ironically, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10115/1052860-109.stm">Shukla claimed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that yoga is divorced enough from Hinduism in the western culture that many yoga enthusiasts don't even know it is Hindu. Many Hindus object specifically to having religious terms and prayers (especially those invoking their gods) used without a devotional purpose. Ironically, modern yoga <em>was</em> begun by a Hindu Indian though.

</p><p>Of the five largest religions in India, Sikhism seems to be the one that most Westerners know nothing about. In fact, a lot of them don't even know what a Sikh is. Due to their beards and turbans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">they often get mistaken for Muslims</a>, despite the fact that the two faiths have nothing to do with each other, so events like 9/11 have led to increases in attacks against Sikhs. But since Sikhs don't get a lot of media attention in the West, anti-Sikhism is rarely addressed. And then there's the issue of the kirpan, a small dagger that Sikhs must carry at all times, but which in fact only traditionalists do. Most Sikhs, even the ones who wear turbans, assimilate heavily into modern society and habits.
</p><p>In Indian media, the stereotype is them being small town yokels (never mind the many urban entrepreneurs and countless small restaurant owners across India) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> types who dance at weddings (which by the way, in no small part, inspired the Bollywood dancing trope that Westerners associate with India).

<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Scientologists</a></strong>
<p>One of the more recent religions in Western society, Scientology is no stranger to controversy. It's often portrayed in media as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Path of Inspiration</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">very litigious one at that</a>. Part of this can be traced to the fact that its core beliefs involve a historical interstellar war and aliens and its founder was a science fiction author, L. Ron Hubbard. In addition, Hubbard joked more than once that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">founded Scientology to turn a profit</a>, and the fact remains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">how high one rises and how much of Scientology's beliefs one learns depends half on how much money one gives them</a> (the other half is how long they have been Scientologists). However Scientology is rarely named or called out directly in fiction. The reason for this is that the aggressively litigious element is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarassingPhoneCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarassingPhoneCall">emphasis</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush">aggressive</a>); some of its higher-ranking members tend to be quick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">call in lawyers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfLawyers">sometimes many</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWannaGetSued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWannaGetSued">and start suing people whenever someone says anything that could be construed as a negative statement about Scientology, or directly names Scientology without endorsing it, either in front of them or on a public forum</a>. It's at the point that Scientology often becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope">The Scottish Trope</a> in fiction or some online communities, even on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a>, which is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Church of Happyology</a> trope exists (and why This Very Wiki doesn't have a Useful Notes Scientology page).

Also, there <em>are</em> Scientologists who hold the religion's beliefs, but are opposed to the church and its founder's actions. These people are called Freezoners.
</p><p>In Belgium, Scientology is the religious equivalent of the drug mafia. This is mainly because there was once an investigation on the sect from 1999 until 2007 that brought to light that they defraud, extort, betray, go against the practices of trade, illegally practice medicine, go against the practices of privacy and participate with criminal organisations. The case was dismissed in 2016, <a class="urllink" href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/1064455/belgian-court-rejects-case-against-scientology/">with the judge saying the suit was brought about as a result of religious prejudice and the prosecutors had been too vague in their case.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In Germany, the Church of Scientology is under <em>blanket scrutiny</em> by law as it is classified as a cult, and similar scrutiny has also emerged in many other nations where Scientology is practiced.

Oh, and humans are really space-gods, but these ghosts infesting us are causing us to be mortal. They even had a huge sign flash on screen during this segment—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">This is what Scientologists actually believe</a></em>.
<ul><li> However, the story of Xenu (also known as the "Wall of Fire" or "Incident II"), while no doubt a part of the Scientology belief system, does not make up the entire crux of Scientology. It's like saying one of the Bible stories is the entire basis of Christian belief, despite other numerous sources. Still, there's quite a lot of solid evidence that the foundation seeks just to milk potential believers for their money, rather than genuine belief.
<ul><li> It does form the entire basis for the auditing process, which is one of Scientology's most sacred and most common rituals, and explains where evil thoughts come from. It may not be the entire crux of Scientology, but it is a major part of it, much like, say, Exodus (and the 10 Commandments contained therein) is a major part of Judaism and Christianity. The really screwed up part of it, though, is that, despite it being such a large part of Scientology's belief system, the average Scientologist doesn't find out about it until they've already invested years upon years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars into the religion.

</p><p>The Church of Satan founded by Anton LaVey, the most known true Satanist school, published the "Eleven Rules of the Earth", most of which are explicitly devoted to not pissing others off and minding your own business. For example, not giving opinions or advice unless you are asked, not complaining about anything to which you need not subject yourself, and not killing non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food. However, the religion's popular image is still heavily influenced by the old Satanic panic, meaning those humanistic aspects are very likely to be ignored in favor of skulls, metal music, Goths, psychos and human sacrifices. Even if a work shows that it has a pretty good handle of the fact that Satanism is not devil worship, expect the portrayal to be equivalent to the most jaded atheist, plus kookiness.

<p>Perhaps because New Age = The Force - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>, those are portrayed as the most unsympathetic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolanders</a>, with a huge side order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Granola Girl</a>, unable to finish a sentence without mentioning crystals, auras, star signs, vibrations, past lives, and/or spirit guides. Also note that the media — this article, for instance — lumps Neopagans, such as Wiccans, in with "New Agers." (When it doesn't portray them as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">made a pact with Satan</a>, that is.)
</p><p>One of their major stereotypes is the "I'll hex/magically cause suffering to/curse you if you cross me" one, which actually goes against the Rule of Three held by many Wiccans. <em>This</em> has its own troubles, though, because the Rule of Three isn't even a belief universally held by all Neopagans, and even among the ones who do, it's not always interpreted the way most new agers/non-traditional Wiccans interpret it. Alternatively, they'll be ruthless con artists cynically manipulating people into buying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil">All-Natural Snake Oil</a> through a veneer of self-righteous airy-fairy drivel. That's in part because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">the number of prominent ones who actually are</a>. Finally, Wiccans are also fairly uniformly portrayed as completely ignorant of the history of their own belief system, to the point of thinking Wicca was practiced in Salem, Massachusetts or even in ancient Europe. Again, this could be attributed to Wicca's admittedly controversial origins, as its founder, Gerald Gardner, claimed to be in possession of millenary religious wisdom passed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> that was exterminated by Christian persecution, a fringe theory (called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-cult_hypothesis">witch-cult hypothesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) among modern academics.
</p><p>Inversely, Norse and Germanic neopagans (sometimes called Astruar or Heathens), are often assumed to be white supremacists or neo-Nazis, because of their use of Germanic symbolism which has been historically appropriated — much to their dismay and disgust — by such groups. It doesn't help that there <em>is</em> a racist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> among the Heathen community, which the rest earnestly attempt to distance themselves from. This may be broadened to other varieties of reconstructive Neo-Paganism, because it is supposed to bring back what roughly speaking was old national religions, and thus its appeal to various kinds of supremacist and nationalist types is not surprising. On the upside, the less negative stereotype just assumes this kind of neopagans to be friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury">Born in the Wrong Century</a> types, fond of historical reenactment as it allows them to live in the past with no-one finding it weird (not that it'd stop them).
</p><p>For their part, Greek Neo-Paganism (called Hellenism) and its Jewish equivalent (informally called Jewitchery) are very rarely featured in works, and whenever they are, they usually get lumpted with the first type.

</p><p>Well known for chanting or singing the Hare Krishna "song", or as it is more properly known, Maha (meaning greatest) Mantra, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness or ISKCON as it is most commonly known is a visible target. Mainly due to misunderstanding about practices or a lack of knowledge of why they "sing the same song" the movement stems from the Vedic culture of ancient India and practices its most visible activity of singing and dancing in the street following the instructions of religious scripture that the fundamental religious process of the age is to congregationally chant the holy names of Krishna (the Maha Mantra or Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare) and by so doing become "Krishna conscious" or "God conscious," literally conscious of who god is and what he is up to (Krishna is a name for God, hes the blue guy with the flute).
</p><p>A lot of the original negative stereotyping came from their reputation for aggressive soliciting of donations, especially at airports-similar to the Jehovah's Witnesses stereotype below. When soliciting was banned in American airports, this became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a>.
</p><p>Most commonly stereotyped as bald-headed white guys in orange robes, it is a worthy note that these are the monastics, and most practitioners of Krishna consciousness are actually married and generally have 2.5 children, etc.
</p><p>Some countries recognize the Hare Krishnas as a sub-sect of Hinduism, or of Vedic culture. It is widely accepted that even though considered a New Religious Movement, their practices date back many thousands of years, some say predating the bible. Their practice of mantra meditation (also congregational chanting) is also proven to be an effective meditation technique with innumerable benefits.
</p><p>However, they are vegetarians and generally love to feed people, making their portrayals slightly more sympathetic. This probably why that Zombie in Dawn of the dead didn't eat anyone (see below).

<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The ultra-religious</a></strong>
<p>There are rarely quietly devout religious believers on American television. Every person openly acknowledged as religious bears some psychological resemblance to the worst, most fundamentalist, most vicious examples of that religion. <em>Every</em> Muslim, to some extent, secretly admires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a>; <em>every</em> Christian is a violently homophobic closet Jerry Falwell or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Jack Chick</a>... and that's not getting into the stereotyping that Jews and Hindus have to endure. In short, characters who treat their religion as something other than stamp-collecting or sport fandom tend to behave as if they got rabies. Of course, the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> will go against the grain of this acceptable target, punishing characters within the show who jump to similar conclusions.

However, most of the Lions aren't actually that religious. Omar, for example, is shown to have a pretty liberal relationship with his wife, who doesn't even wear hijab except at work. One is so out of touch with his own religion that he learns about it from a children's book called "Camel Goes To The Mosque". It's heavily implied the Lions are glory-seekers rather than actual believers. The only true fundamentalist among them is Barry, the white, working-class Muslim convert. Because of this, the person eventually blamed for the terrorist incident is Omar's brother, who is highly fundamentalist (he has a harem and refuses to enter the same room as a woman) but peace-loving, nonviolent, and completely harmless-in fact, he's shown trying to persuade Omar that his plan is forbidden by Islam.

The lead character is a successful lawyer who decided to give up the career and become an imam, for instance, who has often has to deal with the obnoxiously intolerant Babar who is essentially an Islamic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">Archie Bunker</a>.

<ul><li> Also in <em>Firefly</em>, the first scene with Mal in the episode "Serenity" shows him kissing a cross necklace. While he lost his faith at that point, it is a representation of (arguably) the main hero of the series as having been religious at some point.
<ul><li> Mal's loss of faith in his religion is even portrayed as a negative thing, part of his apparent emotional trauma from the war, and a major theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">the movie</a> is the importance of faith in some sort of ideal.

They then did a segment satirizing the Israeli army. This was followed by the same irate viewer saying "I bet you're too gutless to go the Muslims". Cue a segment on Middle Eastern TV. "What about the Hindus?" They "outsourced the show to India". At the end of the episode, they had the same irate viewer complaining that they hadn't made fun of Jedi.
</li><li> This tends to show through in how people will focus on a few certain episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em>, singling out those that come closest to being ultraconservative to try making them representative of the show as a whole. This ignores the many episodes that fly in the face of this perception, including one where the angels very clearly, and in no uncertain terms, informed a gay man dying of AIDS that God loved him unreservedly, was not in any way punishing him, and that he had led a wonderful life with many things to be proud of, without a single whiff of "love the sinner but not the sin".
</li><li> Angela on the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> is described as a very religious person who is serious about her convictions.

When the police became involved and broke the whole thing up, several people who had sat down to protest the haunted house commented negatively about Christians, causing Fred to protest.

</p><p>The basic joke in America is that an atheist can't be elected dog-catcher and that they are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-atheists-we-distrust/">the most disliked and least trusted group<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Historically, dating back to the classical and medieval era, the word atheist was a strong and nasty word often hurled by groups at each other as an insult, largely because they believed "in other gods" or another kind of Christianity, or if they seemed to have some mild doubts about the doctrine and as such not truly believing in their art (what Orwell would label a "thoughtcrime"). The modern version of atheism came out during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a>, the scientific revolution and the French Revolution, and the association of atheism with radical modernity (even if not everyone who was progressive and modernist in those groups were atheists) continues into the 20th and 21st Century. Within America, atheism was somewhat mainstream in the 19th Century, with the likes of Ambrose Bierce being a respected intellectual and wit, and it was at the very least not seen as a mark of disfavour.
</p><p>Some of the modern stigma can be traced historically to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> propaganda from both sides, based at least on a grain of truth. A lot of communist regimes have endorsed state atheism, often in conjunction with violent - even murderous - campaigns against religion/the religious (even communist regimes, such as modern China, that relented from violent anti-religious campaigns have still tried to repress religion through other means).

To be a communist was to be an atheist, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">to be an atheist was to be a communist</a>, and to be either was to be a traitor and Un-American.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note175vjg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note175vjg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note175vjg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There was also the case of the late Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an atheist who founded the American Atheists and was also a Soviet sympathizer who once tried to defect to the USSR. Ironically enough, one of the most vocal and influential anti-communist authors of this era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a>, was herself an atheist.

</p><p>This activism also comes in part from a feeling that it's hard to find a happy, well-adjusted, or optimistic individual on American television who is an openly avowed atheist. Very few TV atheists are portrayed as having come to this conclusion by dispassionate consideration of their experience but, much more likely, they have some tragedy in their past, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">Cynicism Catalyst</a> or gave up after a crisis of faith (which does occur in real-life but isn't universally true). Not appearing to practice or even mention religion at all is fine for most people, but it's generally only characters with a fair degree of cynicism and bitterness who can state outright that they don't believe there is a God, or even that they severely doubt if God exists (however the latter is agnostic, not atheist). In more positive depictions, such characters often reverse or at least re-examine these views after something good happens to them (often in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoTheyKnowItsChristmasTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoTheyKnowItsChristmasTime">Do They Know It's Christmas Time?</a>), even if nothing in the episode suggested a supernatural influence (and especially if there is supernatural influence).

He explains to Harry, "I have met many strange and mighty things since I took up the sword. If one called them 'aliens' instead of 'angels,' it would only mean that I was working in concert with powerful beings, not necessarily the literal forces of Heaven, or a literal Creator.

</p><p>If a religion in the United States practices or advocates polygamy (or rather, polygyny), expect everyone in the media to immediately assume that they are perverts and/or misogynists. Recently, due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> convictions of one leader of a polygamist religion, it is also assumed that any religion that advocates polygamy also forces young girls to "marry" rich old men.
</p><ul><li> There's a little bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> about it: in a lot of places where polygamy is or was practiced, you pretty much <em>have</em> to be rich in order to be able to feed, clothe, and house more than one set of wife + kid(s), and considering how long it can take to make enough money, you're likely going to be notably older than your second/third wife. It is a bitter fact that polygamy tends to turn women into valuable commodities and collectibles.

<ul><li> Aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminism</a>, polygamy tends to bring about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen">Mars Needs Women</a> problem: no society manages it unless the number of polygamous marriages is very small, the young men are eliminated before they can marry, or women are imported into the society. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, deeply despising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonization</a>, put jabs at both issues (among others) in <em>One View of the Question</em>.

</p><p>Seen as wishy-washy fence-sitters by religious folk and atheists alike. There are approximately as many kinds of agnosticism as there are Christian sects, but the majority of them fall into one of two groups: "strong" agnosticism, which holds that the existence of God is inherently unknowable and is either not worth trying to prove or not worth caring about, and "weak" agnosticism, which holds that the question of God's existence hasn't been answered, but still may be. There's further irony in realizing that agnosticism and belief are not actually mutually exclusive (you might not know the answer but you can still believe in it anyway). This frequently leads self-identifying agnostics and atheists/theists to attack each other, not realizing for the longest time (or at all) that they are both on the same side of the argument, just identifying under different groups.
</p><p>It's common for newly deconverted people to refer to themselves as agnostic, when what they really mean is atheist. (Atheist means anyone who doesn't believe in gods, not just those who actively believe they don't exist.) This presents agnosticism as a middle ground between theism and atheism, which it is not. However, there's a certain breed of agnostic who claim that they're better than theists and atheists because they don't hold any unsubstantiated belief: they call atheism a statement of belief too, in this case the belief in that there are no gods, while their agnosticism is statement of knowledge in comparison, because they admit they don't know whether there are any gods. Atheists tend to really hate people with this confusion, as the majority of atheists simply disbelieve through lack of scientific evidence, and even the ones who actually do think no gods exist do not hold this as an absolute belief, but merely the most likely scenario. Any agnostic who continues on in this vein moves from 'person confused by the terminology' to Acceptable Target.
</p><p>Of course, it's also possible for people to (mis?)use "agnostic" to mean "spiritual but unconverted": the idea of thinking there's something out there, but not knowing what, and not including the subtext of "knowing is impossible". In a related matter, deists (those who believe in at least one, usually non-interfering god) often get it pretty bad from all sides. Many atheists consider them "unworthy of their group" for the same reasons they do any other theist and members of other more organized religions scorn them for refusing to commit to <em>any</em> god. However, some atheists "grandfather in" deists who lived in earlier times on the theory that atheism was not an intellectually viable option. Also, for many, it's a conscious choice to use a term that may not be technically correct, due to an <em>explicit desire</em> not to be identified with strong atheists, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">people who insist all of the nonreligious should be called "atheists"</a>.
</p><p>To further complicate things, philosophers and laypeople have different definitions for "atheism," and even amongst philosophers themselves there is a variety of competing definitions as well. If you're a skeptic (you have not been convinced by any theistic argument, therefore don't assume there is a god) or an agnostic (you believe that the idea of a god is so abstract or unknowable that we'll never prove or disprove it), you simply say that. The word "atheist" is reserved for discussing the claim that there is no god, and terms like "agnostic atheist" or "skeptical atheist" are at least immediately contradictory. The idea that an atheist is anyone who doesn't actively believe in a god is the more common, less precise definition used by those who haven't studied the subject. Since the average atheist is usually just a person who happens to not hold that belief rather than someone out to argue it, and the few hardcore atheists unfortunately tend to see theology as a non-subject, none of them know the specific terminology and use the more common definitions. Thus those on both sides of the argument appear to not know their terminology and say of the other "what an ignorant poser, he doesn't even know what he's talking about."

Among other things, they drink only "agnostic beverages", and have to memorize a Code about how religion isn't really worth caring about.

Practitioners of voudon and other Yoruba-derived faiths, such as Santeria, Candomble, and Obeah, are often portrayed as magical and mystical at <em>best</em>. At <em>worst</em>, they're portrayed as murderous, morbid, half-Satanists and practitioners of necromancy and dark magics the likes of which would make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Voldemort</a> soil his robes. Most media portrayal bears little to no resemblance to the actual religion.
