For the 1996 film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep1996">go here</a>. For the 2007 film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep2007">go here</a>.</em>
</p><p>The Black Sheep is the one member of a family who does not fit in, the prodigal son, the castaway from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">The Clan</a> or from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a> — unless he left on his own, smashing the door and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a>. Can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>, but not necessarily.
</p><p>A Black Sheep is not just someone who doesn't fit in with the family — it's someone who rejects their role in the family, either deliberately or not. Or possibly someone whose reputation or morality is at odds with the family reputation/morality, because it makes them different from the rest of the family.
</p><p>The Black Sheep might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> but he can also be the Favorite instead. The latter case, of course, drives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon">The Dutiful Son</a> crazy as to why <em>he's</em> the favored one.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the Black Sheep is <em>really</em> bad — AKA a criminal. Other times a Black Sheep is just considered rebellious, and might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle">Cool Uncle</a>. On occasion, he is actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a>. Often, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold">Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold</a>.
</p><p>In kids shows, there's a common Aesop where a Black Sheep from one of the kids' families will show up as either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> (or brother) or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolUncle">Cool Uncle</a>. Often the Cool Relative will inspire emulation by all the kids in town (sometimes excepting only the kid who is actually related to him). Eventually this emulation gets the kids into trouble. Either the Black Sheep helps the kids out and then delivers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> that they really don't want to be like him, or he reveals himself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and leaves the kids in their mess (often to be saved by the one kid who didn't emulate the Black Sheep).

<ul><li> Urd from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> is an example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a>, who is also a Black Sheep. Her reputation just doesn't quite fit with the expected behavior of a Goddess (being half-Demon doesn't help).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> has Noelle Silva, the daughter of the Silva family who can't properly control her magic. Due to her lack of mastery over her powers, she is seen as a black sheep by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">Badass Family</a> and this trope is made even worse for her since their mother died giving birth to her. Noelle's siblings openly state — to Noelle and to others — that she is a shame and they believe she should have died instead of their mother. At the same time, Noelle can also be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a>, as she is the sole member of her family so far who is not a raging, elitist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> that actively diminishes those of the lower class.
<ul><li> The entire squad of Black Bulls (Noelle joins this group) are full of Black Sheep for one reason or another. Putting them together with Asta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> willpower turns the whole squad into a surprisingly-capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>.
<ul><li> Asta: The main character, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a>) in a world of wizards until the titular grimoire appeared before him that allowed him to summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> weapons. He still has no magic of his own and is constantly looked down upon because of this.
</li><li> Finral: Passed over for head of his noble family for his much-more-powerful half-brother.
</li><li> Gauche: Had his nobile title and wealth stolen and became a common criminal to protect his sister.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Henry, the keeper of the squad's base (his magic allows him to rearrange it), was abandoned by his parents because of a condition that renders him a constant magical leech. It's only within the labyrinthe confines of the base that he can keep this condition from affecting anyone else (including his squadmates) too much. The only reason Asta can befriend him is because Asta has no magic to leech.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Kirsch Vermillion, vice-captain of the Coral Peacocks, is this for the Vermillion family. While his sister Mimosa is one of the kindest people in the entire kingdom and his cousins Fuegoleon, Mereoleona and Leopold don't care about social status (only talent and determination matter to them), Kirsch is more of a typical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> noble who despises all commoners. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even after he realizes the error of his ways, Kirsch is <em>still</em> the odd one out in the family, because he's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hammy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock">beauty-obsessed</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">but highly competent</a>) goofball, while the other Vermillions are <em>very</em> serious-minded.</span>

Uryuu even walked out on his father in disgust and now refuses to live with him, preferring to honour his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">grandfather's</a> memory instead. Ryuuken is in fact an extremely powerful Quincy master who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral">withholding</a> his power and encouraging his son to think the worst of him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">mysterious</a> reasons. Souken does once imply that Ryuuken's "rebellious" behaviour is due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection">Declaration of Protection</a> but Uryuu isn't willing to listen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The final arc reveals that Uryuu's mother and Ichigo's mother were murdered nine years ago in an attack by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Quincy King</a> that should also have killed him, revealing to Yhwach that Uryuu is immune to his power.

The catch is that the arrow must be fired by someone whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">future Yhwach is unable to see</a>; the only person capable of doing this is Uryuu, so Ryuuken protects the secret of the arrow for nine years until Uryuu is finally strong enough to use it.</span>

The reason is that the original Nameless Namekian was corrupted by the evilness of Earthlings (similar happened to Lord Slug), resulting that he split himself into a good side and evil side. Namekians in nature are not evil and are peaceful, even the Warrior class Namekians.
<ul><li> In general The Super Namekians (Piccolo, Slug) are this for most Namekians people (who are all related) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">Drunk with Power</a> they caused great chaos to the normally peaceful planet until the elders banished them with the Dragon Balls leaving the Great Namekians to travel though space aimlessly.

Tarble also married a non-humanoid which is rare for the Saiyans so far, like Goku he can also be seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Zamasu can be considered this for the Supreme Kais, which previously in the Buu saga had been shown to be a peaceful people but Zamasu on the other hand is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">tyrannical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist">narcissistic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Sadist</a>.

Justified in the sense that he never truly mastered Hokuto Shinken, and in fact spent several years running around doing other things instead of spending time training.
<ul><li> To be absolutely fair, the eldest brother Raoh wasn't <em>too much better</em> than Jagi, since he did murder their adoptive father as he broke the 1800-year law of Hokuto by refusing to give up his power to his younger brother, Kenshiro. Similar to Jagi, he didn't spend his time training like Toki and Kenshiro, since Raoh is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledbutStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledbutStrong">ridiculously strong without training</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Nefertari family (Cobra, the late Titi, and Vivi) is descended from one of the ancient 20 kingdoms who formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The World Government</a>, but defected from Mariejois to keep living in their own kingdom. This caused the rulers of the World Government to view them as "traitors", making them another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> in the eyes of the World Nobles in general. But to readers, they're actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a>.
</li><li> Since there's the suggestion that those with the "Will of D" are connected, this means Marshall D. Teach, aka "Blackbeard" is the black sheep of the D. family, since he's both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>. In contrast, Luffy, Ace, Roger, Saul, Law, and Rouge were good and brave people.
</li><li> Sabo didn't follow his family's tradition of being asshole nobles who lorded their titles and wealth over everyone, and was mocked for it by both his family and his adopted brother, Stelly. When he discovered his parents wanted to burn down the Gray Terminal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">its people included</a>) because a World Noble was visiting their kingdom, Sabo had enough and ran away from home, never knowing if Luffy and Ace (who also lived in the Gray Terminal) survived until years later. This led to a series of events that got him picked up by Revolutionaries, and he has been staying with them since.
</li><li> Justified with Donquixote Doflamingo, who is this for the Donquixote Family. While his father, mother, younger brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and their relative Mjosgard</span> discarded their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Noble arrogance</a> and became legitimately good human beings, Domflamingo continued acting like a typical World Noble as a child and wouldn't shut up about his former title. This behavior exposed them as former World Nobles, giving the victims of the World Nobles a legitimate reason to cast out and even attack them. The squalid conditions the Donquixote familly were forced to live in caused Doffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">mother</a> to die from an illness that could have been prevented with the World Nobles' high-class medicine, leading to deep resentment and hatred that motivated Doffy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide">blow his father's brains out</a> while Homing was apologizing for his mistakes. After all that, Doflamingo still has learned nothing of his family's ethics, seeing himself above the "commoners" and is openly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Sadist</a>. Even his brother believed that Doflamingo was born evil.
</li><li> In-universe Sanji is seen as this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the Vinsmoke Family, since he is the only male member of the family who doesn't believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> or that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsAWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsAWeakness">Virtue Is A Weakness</a>. He was supposed to be an emotionless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">weapon</a> like his brothers, thanks to Judge experimenting on him in utero, but his mother, Sora, desperately consumed a dangerous drug to protect her quadruplet sons and reverse their genetic modifications, at the cost of her own life. While Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji have only a shred of empathy left, Sanji was born with his still intact, resulting in him becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">Supreme Chef</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">got his strength and powers through natural training and experience</a> instead of using technology and science like his family does.

</li><li> Lola <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was this for the Charlotte Family, as she defied the wishes of her mother, Big Mom, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">marry</a> Prince Loki of the Elbaf kingdom by running away from home to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookingforLoveinAlltheWrongPlaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookingforLoveinAlltheWrongPlaces">find her own love</a>.

Praline was initially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until she made the decision to run away with the Sun Pirates when they decided to leave Totto Land, and later helped the Straw Hats escape Big Mom's clutches by distracting her sea slugs with song. Pudding is an interesting case - she's Big Mom's favored child, but only because her heritage as a Three-Eyed person would potentially allow her to read poneglyphs (which, as she points out, would be impossible due to being a half-breed). Before that, she was widely mocked, scorned, and abused for having three eyes, which made her a freak in the eyes of her neighbors and even her own family. So while she decided to secretly help Sanji to pay him back for the nice compliments he gave her, she couldn't leave her family behind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">and she knows it</a></span>.

After being abducted into the SPARTAN-II program, most of the Spartan-II candidates were able to quickly adjust to their new lives as soldiers; cooperation, teamwork, and camaraderie were easily integrated into their minds, and within five months they were fully willing to take on their training. The only exceptions were the three Spartans who would become "Gray Team", who were the most difficult to control during training. These trainees were loners who tried constantly to escape, and resisted indoctrination in any way possible. As their escape attempts became increasingly costly, with numerous trainers suffering broken fingers and shattered knee caps and at least one Pelican dropship hijacked and destroyed, the three Spartans were eventually formed into their own team, trained separately from the rest. As such, Gray Team's members are the most independent and individualistic of the Spartan-IIs, trained to operate for long periods with little control or assistance.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> House Baratheon is primarily known as a family of warriors and Lord Renly is viewed as something of an embarrassment because he is often criticized by his older brothers for being a non-fighter. King Robert is especially disparaging of his youngest sibling's masculinity, calling him a "boy" during their hunting trip because he doesn't consider Renly to be a "real man."
</li><li> The uncontrollable teenage sociopath Joffrey would ordinarily take on the role in contrast to his sweet-natured and well-behaved siblings Tommen and Myrcella, but is never treated like this due to being his mother's decided favourite and because he had too much power for anybody (except perhaps his grandfather Tywin Lannister) to challenge directly. Since he was seen as too weak to hold power, meek, good-hearted Tommen was liked by the adult Lannisters but also treated as a bit of a black sheep.
</li><li> The show is very clever in how it plays with this trope in relation to Tommen. In the earlier seasons, Cersei and her father's preference for a brutal psychopathic maniac (Joffrey) over a kind and sweetly eccentric little boy (who loved to spend his time playing alone with his cats) was used to make the Lannisters seem even more ruthless and unhinged. Then, Tommen comes to power, and it's clear he actually is much too weak and in no way psychologically equipped to make the harsh decisions required of a king and his reign ends up being at least as disastrous as his older brother's.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome">middle brother</a> Stannis Baratheon fits this trope because, while he is certainly a great warrior like his family members, his family (especially his brothers) is mostly comprised of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharmer">extroverted</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">charismatic leaders</a> with the ability to inspire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> in almost anyone. Stannis, on the other hand, stands out as being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">introverted</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">sullen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> who is mistrusted and disliked by nearly everyone except a bunch of religious extremists who see him as their new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">messiah</a> and one very loyal smuggler. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">very bitter</a> about this.
</li><li> Tyrion for being a dwarf. His brother Jaime loves Tyrion and Tyrion loves him but their father resents Tyrion for being a dwarf and both their father and sister resent Tyrion because Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him.
</li><li> Jon, to a lesser degree, for being Ned Stark's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimate son</a> raised alongside his trueborn siblings in the Stark family — though he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">takes after his lord father</a> quite a bit and loves and is loved by his father, trueborn siblings, and uncle (but he is Catelyn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">Unfavorite</a> for being Ned's illegitimate son).
<ul><li> The position of black sheep rotated around the Stark family a lot. Robb, Sansa and Bran were the definite white sheep, but there was also Arya, who totally refused to adopt traditional female behavioural norms and was prone to asserting her own beliefs and opinions, and foster brother/hostage Theon who never challenged Ned's authority or misbehaved while Ned was looking (most likely because he was too scared to confront Ned directly) but was by far the most destructive, reckless and poorly-behaved when Ned wasn't looking. He also doesn't seem to particularly well-liked among his foster siblings and did and said things which would be completely acceptable in his birth culture (for example, boasting about hypothetical rape and murder) but were totally unacceptable and creepy in the culture of the North. Rickon is too young to be an official black sheep, but is characterised as being wild and prone to violence in both the television series and books, so he would have likely taken up this position had his family unit survived long enough.
</li></ul></li><li> Theon is also this among his birth family, the Greyjoys, as he was raised in a different culture (specifically, under the roof of a hated man who executed/murdered his much more preferred older brothers ), though his sister loves him. Interestingly, given that Theon is the only member of his Viking clan who (as an adult, at least) has any real problem with rape and pillage-related murder, he's simultaneously the black sheep and the white sheep.
</li><li> Sam for being the fat, timid, and bookish son of a great warrior. Leads to some pretty horrific child abuse, as his father gives him the option of either being murdered or "voluntarily" joining an extremely deadly military order he would have seemed woefully unequipped to survive, because doing so would involve Sam forgoing his right to inherit the headship of his family.
</li><li> Brynden "The Blackfish" Tully gets his nickname after being called the black sheep of a family, whose House sigil is a fish.

</li><li> Garthe Knight of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em> series, who's morality (or more accurately, his complete lack of morality) is at odds with that of the his father, Wilton Knight.
</li><li> Joxer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> claims to have been the black sheep of his family. Specifically, his father is a warlord, his mother is a warlord's wife, and his brother is an assassin of renown. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe">He can't compare.</a> Oddly, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoungeLizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoungeLizard">a third brother</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Neither brother likes to talk about him.</a> Maybe he's the true black sheep?

Common to this trope, dutiful Son David feels angry about their recently deceased father's perceived favouritism of Nate.

Especially since she's the only one to have blond hair while the rest of her family has black hair.
</li><li> A 1998 issue of Soap Opera Digest had a feature which discussed each show's creepiest family. A black sheep of each family was mentioned-in this case the member that was a relatively good and normal person compared to the rest of his/her family. The entry on As The World Turns had this (intentionally or not) funny line: "Paul is the only Stenbeck who hasn't, at one time or another, gone crazy and terrorized half the town. Not coincidentally, he's also the only one who's never 'died'"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePalace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePalace">The Palace</a></em> featured the interesting case of Prince David, the late king's estranged brother. Unfortunately, the program was cancelled after one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">short</a> series and the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">never got to appear onscreen</a>. Apparently he got divorced at some point, then lost his whole estate after his business went bankrupt, a situation precipitated by drug and alcohol problems.

(Coincidentally, David's nephew, Prince George, remarks that he saw him once and that he was "like a ghost.")
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, Natalie is one to her family, the founders of the brand name Davenport Toothpaste. This is clearly seen in "Mr. Monk Goes to a Wedding" where she is on very bad terms with her mother Peggy and father Bobby (even though they dote heavily on Julie). Peggy doesn't even know that Natalie is not a bartender anymore when she tries to have Natalie test a Bloody Mary to see what is wrong (ultimately Randy has to do this role). Peggy also refuses to display Mitch's photos on the piano at home. Also, she doesn't want to believe Monk and Natalie when they try to warn her that her new daughter-in-law Theresa Scott is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> who tried to kill Randy and eventually tries to kill Jonathan, but is stopped in the nick of time. At the end, we see that photos of Natalie are back on the family piano at home, indicating that they've reconciled. In the next episode where Natalie's parents appear, "Mr. Monk Is At Your Service," Monk and Natalie are seen having a friendly lunch with them, which seems to indicate that they are back on good terms.
<ul><li> Natalie even uses the trope name to describe herself during a monologue in the novel <em>Mr. Monk in Outer Space</em> as she and Monk are on their way to question Brandon Lorber's widow Veronica in the following paragraph:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>Stottlemeyer and Disher, being poorly paid civil servants, would have been uneasy around so much money and power, which is probably why they opted to let us see Veronica Lorber on our own. I think the captain believed that a black-sheep rich girl and a socially clueless detective would be more effective with the widow Lorber than they would be. Money and influence are kryptonite for people whose livelihoods depend on the whims of politicians.</em>
