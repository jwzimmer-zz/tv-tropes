</li><li> King Riku of Dressrosa, in backstory, was the previous king before Donquixote Doflamingo launched a takeover. After Doflamingo is disposed, Riku is reluctant to take back the throne because he's worried that his peaceful policies are what made the kingdom vulnerable to the pirate's schemes in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> Nineteen-years-old Emperor Ryuuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em>. Growing up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">the youngest of six princes</a>, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">found himself on the throne</a> after his second eldest brother was exiled and the other princes were executed for starting a bloody succession war. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">acts dumb and plays up his attraction to men</a> and desperately waits for his exiled brother to return to take the throne. However, his subordinates <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and said brother</span> have none of that.
</li><li> Prince Clovis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is a darker version of this. He's a painter, not a warrior or politician, and he wanted nothing to do with that sort of work, even though that made his family <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">seriously look down on him</a>. But then, his younger brother Lelouch, who he secretly admired, was (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding">supposedly</a>) killed in the invasion of Japan, and Clovis thought he should accept the role of Viceroy to honor him. Advised by his older brother and sister that "a soft heart is not a virtue", he attempts to become the sort of ruthless Viceroy the other Britannians would want him to be, under the mistaken belief that Lelouch would want that, too. By the time we see him in the beginning of the series, several years later, he's completely fallen into that to the point where Lelouch wants nothing more than to kill <em>him</em> - and does, in the first few episodes.
<ul><li> Said brother is an interesting variation of it. Lelouch flat out rejects the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">Decadent Court</a> of Britannia and gets exiled for his troubles. Which leads him into being the powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> Zero who sets himself up as leader of all Japan by the end of the first season before things go to hell. However, <em>R2</em> sees him greatly reducing his power and putting others in charge of actually ruling the world while he focuses on military matters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though he does end up Emperor of Britannia, he only rules for a few months before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Requiem</a> ends with him dead.</span> The implication is that Lelouch will lead when someone <em>has</em> to do something to better the world, which he references when he first brings up restoring Japan as a nation back in season 1; that if they don't do it, who will? In short, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler">Reluctant Ruler</a> with a sense of responsibility.

Elias plays the trope straight, not wanting to be a ruler and only took up the throne to save the kingdom from Patch, Antoine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>.

Despite being a fair and competent ruler, the King's true dream was to be an adventurer like Link, but he was a prince, and a prince has to stay home and train to take up the reins of kingship one day.
</li><li> After the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfKings">War of Kings</a></em>, Gladiator wandered out into the ruined capital city in a daze, still carrying the Imperial Scepter. As he surveyed the chaos around him, the people looked to him and the scepter, and begged him for guidance. Gladiator, having spent his life defining himself as a soldier, was unprepared to be a ruler. For the sake of the people, he agreed to be the new Majestor. He's done a pretty good job so far.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> has twice found himself being nominated for the position of the Chief Judge, and therefore his city's sole ruler.

<ul><li> Robert Baratheon didn't rebel against the Targaryens because he wanted the Iron Throne. He did it because he wanted to take back Lyanna Stark from Rhaegar Targaryen and because Rhaegar's father Aerys had ordered his and his best friend Eddard Stark's deaths. At the end of the rebellion, Robert killed Rhaegar, but felt no satisfaction since Lyanna died under mysterious circumstances anyway. Robert was forced to take the Iron Throne due to the Baratheon line being descended from a Targaryen bastard and Robert's grandmother being a Targaryen. Robert was an incompetent ruler because he hated being stuck with an uncomfortable throne made of melted down swords, a wife he hated because she wasn't Lyanna, and the huge responsibilities of ruling an entire continent which he passed on to his advisors.
</li><li> And then Robert appointed Eddard Stark to be his Hand, thus making him the one who had to de facto run the Seven Kingdoms. Ned's bad feeling he had upon taking up this position was eventually proven right: His honorable attitude was not all too well suited for handling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a> of King's Landing - in fact, it did eventually result in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ned's death by execution.</span>
</li><li> Similarly there is Robert's brother Stannis. He claims the throne after Robert's death, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">knowing Robert's children with Cersei are actually illegitimate.</span> Stannis does this because he is very lawful and feels taking the Iron Throne is his duty. Unfortunately, much of Westeros sees him as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">lack of social skills</a> causes him trouble in winning support. It becomes clear Stannis doesn't really want to be ruler and his obsession with duty, especially when it conflicts with his very strong principles, takes a huge strain on him, such as when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he considers burning one of Robert's bastards for magical aid, because he feels his duty is more important then what he personally wants</span>.
</li><li> In general, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> by the series. Rulers who don't want to rule don't always have a sense of duty to compensate for lack of incentive to govern well, or even at all.

Once everybody was unified and no longer drafting peasants into their selfish power struggles, he gave up Emperor-ship to the <em>actual</em> heir (who was both virtuous and competent, but couldn't have done what Theo did because he was too preoccupied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">romantic shenanigans</a> during the war) and went back home to be Lord of Sistina.

They can accept the role eagerly, take up the mantle reluctantly, or something in between.
<ul><li> Background lore found in this game shows that this was the case for Emperor Florian of Orlais, a few decades before the events of the games. He never expected to rule, since his older brother Judicael II had twin sons and it was presumed that one of them would succeed their father. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">the Hundred Days' Cough</a> swept through Orlais and killed many children, including both of Judicael's sons and Florian's daughter.

Seeing that no one else is willing, Lysander forms the new nation of Palaendra. He becomes such a great ruler that people offer to crown him king. He refuses, however, as, in his mind, only a true Gryphonheart can be king. He always considers himself merely a steward. However, when a man shows up claiming to be a Gryphonheart, Lysander is reluctant to hand over the throne. Not because he isn't willing, but because he doesn't trust the newcomer's claim. When Lysander ends up proving that the man is an impostor and finding out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he himself is a Gryphonheart</span>, he reluctantly allows himself to be crowned king.

</li><li> While Liu Bei in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a> was reluctant, his historical counterpart seems to have been a subversion. The man rarely served a lord long, and betrayed both Sun Quan &amp; Liu Zhang to take Yi Province, from which he based his Shu Kingdom.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, while Cao Cao is often presented in fiction as a power hungry tyrant, he never (publicly) sought to replace the Emperor. In keeping with Confucian practice, he made a good show of humility and refusing honours. However, he did continue to eventually accept them—and frankly, after Wang Mang, you don't get the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_bestowments">Nine Bestowments<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> unless you (discreetly) ask for them, as a way of confirming you have enough support to take over the government if not usurp the throne. Whether he truly was an ambitious warlord out for what he could get away with or a humble, final hero of the Han is a question for the ages.
</li></ul></li><li> Prince Albert, Duke of York, would have liked nothing more than to live quietly with his nice family, and, since he was the second son, this was a reasonable expectation. However, his brother Edward VIII turned out to be a complete screwup, a playboy and Nazi sympathiser who earned the contempt of the establishment and was forced to abdicate. Albert (as George VI) shouldered the duties of the King-Emperor, the stress of which is often thought to have considerably hastened his death, and he's generally considered to have done so pretty well (being the figurehead for the nation during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> didn't hurt).
</li><li> Pope Benedict XVI may not have ever wanted to be Pope, claiming publically that he prayed he would never gain the position. Unfortunately for him, in the Roman Catholic Church, one oath <em>all</em> priests must swear to upon becoming ordained is to be willing to accept the position if selected. He ultimately became the first pope in nearly <em>six hundred years</em> to resign, the last to do so having been Gregory XII in 1415 — and that was forced upon him in order to resolve the schism created by the Avignon Papacy. (He was the first to resign under his own volition since Celestine V in 1294.)
</li><li> Yao, the first king/emperor of China, supposedly passed his throne to Shun because he was the most competent and he didn't want the job. Shun similarly passed it to Yu, but Yu couldn't find anybody who qualified who wasn't too old, and so when he died, the throne went to his son and the position became hereditary. Future emperors would try to justify their own rule by having the previous regime (if said ruler wasn't related by blood) "voluntarily" abdicate.
</li><li> King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI</a> was noted in his lifetime for being extremely reluctant and hesitant and seemed to not really enjoy being King, and somehow even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, he was constantly insecure and weak, sensitive to constant insults about how different he was from the tradition of French monarchy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iohd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2iohd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iohd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was shy and timid, where French Kings were cold and decisive, he was also monogamous and stayed faithful to his wife, which provoked a scandal among aristocrats who mocked his prudishness. He also had unusually hands-on hobbies for a monarch (he liked locksmithing and tinkering with clocks) and was unusually pious for a French aristocrat of his era. Interestingly, his British contemporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">George III</a> was also noted for being deliberate, pious, and faithful to his wife, and also had a weird hobby (his was farming—like actually running a farm with the latest equipment and techniques). Unlike Louis, however, George could get away with it—partly because George did have an otherwise stronger personality than Louis, and partly because as a constitutional monarch, George's personal inclinations didn't matter as much to the British system as Louis' did to the French absolutist one.</span>. Even when he finally called for reforms to fix a financial crisis and escalating famine, he was perceived as being reluctant to follow through on the reforms he had himself called for, while at the same time not being as repressive on the revolutionaries and his subjects as his opponents had insisted upon. Even when he planned his famous Flight to Varennes, he left the planning to his wife and fatally delayed taking action.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion">Sun Yat-sen</a>, the first President of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">post-imperial</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">Republic of China</a>, was very reluctant to rule as President due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">feeling of inadequacy</a> and thus presented the title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Yuan Shikai</a>, a prominent figure in the Chinese military that had previously worked for the pre-revolutionary Qing Dynasty. Shortly after being appointed President, Shikai ruled China <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGeneralissimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGeneralissimo">as an autocratic despot</a>, relying heavily on 'local elites' (i.e. warlords) in the various provinces to maintain order and stability. After having created a short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Empire with himself as Emperor,</a> Shikai died in 1916, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution">culminating in a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe">balkanization of China</a> into various warlord states.

After his own sons died, he grew depressed and retired to Capri, leading his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">praetorian prefect</a> to institute of a reign of terror in his name. Tiberius was eventually convinced to act against Sejanus the prefect, leading to fresh purges. He eventually died on Capri, leaving the principate to his very young great-nephew Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Claudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Claudius">Claudius</a> is commonly portrayed as such (see <em>I, Claudius</em> above), and given that he was appointed Emperor by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> just after they'd killed his nephew Caligula it's not that hard to believe.
</li><li> This trait is often attributed to more than one of Rome's "Five Good Emperors"
<ul><li> Nerva was elected Emperor by the senate after Domitian's assassination, and hastily accepted to avoid a civil war. But his reign was marred by financial crises and civil strife from his reluctance to exert authority.
</li><li> Marcus Aurelius seems to have been more interested in Stoic philosophy than ruling, only accepting the position of emperor on the condition that he split his responsibilities with his adopted brother Lucius Verus. After Verus died he appointed his son Commodus as his new co-emperor, though there's no evidence he intended a random general to be his eventual successor.
