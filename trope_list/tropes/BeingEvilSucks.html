She simply couldn't bring herself to pull the trigger after seeing that her intended victim was no longer a villain, living in poverty in Los Angeles, trying his hardest to help his sister take care of her children.

But she was smarter than the others, and quickly called the Avengers hotline, and got in contact with USAgent, and as a result, they both brought the entire organization down.

Then, the real kicker, Gerard, who has been encouraging all this crazy, reveals that he is dying of cancer and that his plan along along has been to use the Hunters to help him capture the alpha so that he can receive the bite and become a werewolf to survive the disease, making it fully clear that he knows he will have to kill his son to do it.

This is an interesting variation, as the protagonist of the story thinks he's the hero charging in to save the day, but he subconsciously knows he's done bad things, and this drives him to insanity, reinforcing the game's central themes: an examination of what soldiers go through and how their mental state is affected, and a look at just how far removed modern war shooters are from reality.</span>

<ul><li> From a gameplay standpoint, the No Mercy run requires you to kill enough of the randomly encountered monsters so that no more will appear in each area. The game is also coded to decrease the frequency of random encounters as you approach to quota (probably in order to ensure that no one falls into a No Mercy run unintentionally) so a lot of time is going to be wasted simply walking around looking for monsters to kill. Furthermore, on a No Mercy run you're powerful enough that you will kill almost every single monster in a single hit (the exceptions can be counted on one hand with fingers to spare) so the gameplay quickly becomes rote and unengaging. And what bosses <em>do</em> take more than one hit to kill are difficult, so freakishly difficult (and lampshaded as such) in a frustrating fashion that you don't get any satisfaction from actually fighting them because they're so unfair and cheap and are deliberately designed as such.
</li><li> From a storyline standpoint, the game does everything it can to guilt-trip you into abandoning a No Mercy run after you begin it. For example, Towns will be empty in No Mercy because everyone is fleeing for their lives from you, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what would be the second boss of a regular run will refuse to fight you in No Mercy, because he believes you're lashing out in confusion and fright and that you can be a better person if you try, and offers his friendship to you. You kill him in a single hit, and his final words are to say that he still believes in your potential to be a good person.</span>

It grows stronger the more the user hates its Trainer, but it's considerably easier to make them happier (simply walking around will do it) while methods of making them dislike you are rather limited. What's more, many Pokémon start off with a neutral affection towards the player, and the move's inverted counterpart, Return (which grows in power the more the user likes its Trainer), is far easier to use, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">making Frustration not worth the effort</a>.
