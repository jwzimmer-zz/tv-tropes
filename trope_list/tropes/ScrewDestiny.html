She may not have been the mastermind behind the Grand Plan to Cheat Destiny (the credit goes to Mashiro), but she was perhaps the only character who truly believed that fate was nothing next to determination, not to mention the only HiME who actively participated in the successful plan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>:</em>
<ul><li> If there's one thing that the franchise as a whole teaches, it is that Fate is not set in stone and that mortals can control their own futures.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, the original series:
<ul><li> Yugi's Millennium Puzzle gives him the power to alter fate. By the final duel, he's mastered it enough to be able to draw whatever card he wants without fail.
</li><li> This can also be a subversion if looked at it from another perspective. The various duelists' ability for the "destiny draw" means that they are actively controlling the cards that they pull, but are still under the control of their cards. A running theme that they have is that Destiny has a habit of catching up no matter how you fight it and the ability to pull whatever card you want out of your deck only facilitates it because these players are literally playing into the hands of destiny. This is especially apparent in the Duelist Kingdom arc where the Destiny draw would actually work in Pegasus' favor while just playing blindly actually got results. (In fact, there are only four duels in the <em>entire franchise</em> where a duelist has drawn a card that wasn't useful; one of them was Yugi, who got <em>two bad draws in a row</em> in his duel with Mai.)
</li><li> Ishizu Ishtar has the ability to see the future, and predicts many things in relation to our heroes, the villain, and the Battle City Tournament. However, she loses this ability after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> Kaiba defies his predicted defeat to her by his <em>own</em> vision of his past self. From Battle City onwards, half of Kaiba's dialogue is pretty much "Screw Destiny!" even after it's clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">he can't fight fate</a>.

<ul><li> In the second season, the hero is sought out by the villain for his power to <em>defy</em> destiny and overturn the results the villain sees in his premonitions. Despite several prophecies coming true (including one for the next season), the overall impression is that it's seeing or trying to see the future that robs one of power over their fate, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>.

This plan not only fails miserably, but Asuka defects from the Society of Light as a result, costing him a valuable minion.

<ul><li> Yusei, Jack, and Crow during their match against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex Goodwin</span>, pretty much state that they will beat him even if it means flipping Fate the bird. This is further compounded by Yusei summoning Savior Star Dragon near the end, who only shows up when it's time to spit in Destiny's face.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex himself</span> had a goal with this type of attitude. He wanted to stop what he believed was a "vicious cycle" of good and evil fighting each over again and again, something that was supposedly fated to happen repeatedly until the end of time. One could say he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">somewhat of a noble cause</a>, but his way of doing it, by destroying the world and then remaking it, was the wrong approach.

Just like his father, it wasn't out of duty to the Main Branch, but out of love for his friends and family.
</li><li> One subversion comes late into the series, as Naruto is prophesied to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bring either order or destruction to the world</span>, which he fully intends to do, and has even admitted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">he plans to face the fate seen in the Toad Sage's latest vision</a>. It's just that nobody <em>knew</em> this was his destiny before.
</li><li> The biggest example in this series is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto and Sasuke</span> are the reincarnations of the two sons of the Sage of Six Paths, Ashura and Indra respectively. The Sage of Six Paths himself tells Naruto that every reincarnation of his two sons have fought to the death with one another, and no reincarnations were ever fully successful in defying that cursed fate. Not even the previous ones, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hashirama and Madara</span>, who formed a village together. Like many before him, this incarnation of Ashura was forced to kill Indra's reincarnation when he tried to destroy the very village they formed.

This person, who has the strongest will in all of Cephiro, must dedicate their mind entirely to it's well-being. <em>Any</em> consideration to themselves will cause the entire system to collapse. The result of denying this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a> facing against her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of Cephiro's despair, while the manga took things farther; she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">challenges God himself to change the system</a>.

<ul><li> Interestingly, basically everything that happens, however, is the consequence of one hero trying to fight Fate by going back in time, borking the entire space-time continuum. So, you <em>can</em> fight fate, it just screws things up really, really, really badly.
</li><li> Played straight with the villain, however. His entire plan was to save someone's life from a predicted death. His plan to save her prompted her to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save one of the victims of his plan.

<ul><li> The first is that Escaflowne itself is forged to <em>alter</em> destiny to suit its use. Controlling it becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s goal simply so his advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">plans for controlling events</a> through his precognitive visions won't be disrupted.

However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fakir and Ahiru</span> learn their original, tragic fates and set out to change them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a> of the anime are "May those who accept their fate find happiness, may those who defy it, <em>glory.</em>"
</li><li> In episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess">Scrapped Princess</a></em>, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a> that Pacifica is capable of screwing with the divine plan of the Peacemakers, since she was one of the few who weren't programmed from birth to follow their every wish.
</li><li> The Brand of Sacrifice on Guts's neck in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is a double-edged sword - it draws demons to him, but because he didn't die when he was <em>supposed</em> to, he's now an unpredictable factor in Fate. Screwing destiny over becomes his purpose in life after that, much to the surprise and amusement of the Godhand.
<ul><li> This one's perhaps best expressed in Guts's declaration of war on the demons from the manga, which can be found in the Quotes Wiki part of this page and which ranks as perhaps the most badass speech in the entire series. Hell, probably the most badass speech in telling destiny to go screw itself.
</li><li> A missing chapter reveals that this was <em>inverted</em> in the backstory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Idea of Evil, the true power behind the Godhand, was willed into being by the collective subconsciousness of humanity because they could not accept that their suffering had no greater meaning or reason behind it.</span>

<ul><li> What she does, as Aizen ably described, is rejection of events through her Shun Shun Rikka, of which at least the Santen Kesshun (which repels attacks) and the Souten Kisshun (which "rewinds" wounds to a healing point, like she did to an one-armed Grimmjow, for example) are known to do this (not quite the case with the Koten Zanshun, which is an attacking technique). So, by stopping an enemy from hitting her or undoing potentially deadly wounds, she's basically giving destiny a "screw you".
</li><li> It doesn't really have to be wounds either. Theoretically, it could be anything, including birth, aging and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">next tier power ups</a>.

At the same time, Kizaki takes advantage of his destiny by running all kinds of risks in the course of his quest, confident that he won't die until he turns 20 in three years' time.

In particular, she tells Neo that Morpheus will die because of his mistaken belief that Neo is The One. When Neo says "screw destiny!" and charges in to rescue him, he realizes that he is The One after all.

</li><li> The Oracle also comments that "no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand", meaning she can tell people something that MAY happen, yet it's their choice what to do with it. The Architect, she notes, can't see past <em>any</em> choice.

<ul><li> In the short story the movie is based on, it happens a little bit differently. There are three prophesies made in quick succession, some of which show the main character committing murder but others don't (or show him committing a different murder). The difference is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the first two prophesies each affected the ones that followed them.

</li><li> Arguably the main theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck">Paycheck</a></em>. The main character uses a time machine to see his own death in the future and spends the rest of the movie trying to change his fate. Ironically, he ultimately succeeds while the villains, who are trying to fulfill what the time machine shows and predicts, fail.

She tells him it will be short lived. He replies with "I make my own destiny." This is a line he also uses earlier when someone mentions fate or destiny. His declaration that he makes his own destiny and the prophecy that his time as king will be cut short are <em>both</em> proven correct when, in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King 3</a></em>, his wife dies and he deliberately lets the kingdom fall apart to go back to his life as a mercenary.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>. Harry spends much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Half-Blood Prince</a></em> worrying about the prophecy that marked him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>. Eventually, Dumbledore makes Harry realize that the prophecy means nothing and Harry is perfectly free to walk away from all of it.

<ul><li> It's convincing when Voldemort doesn't want either of them to do this, and will track down Harry and duel him in order to fulfill the prophecy.
</li><li> "Neither can live while the other survives." In the final analysis, the trope is completely beside the point as neither Voldemort nor Harry have any interest in averting the prophecy in the end. Voldemort knows Harry has the power to defeat him eventually, but there's no certainty he'll actually do it, and Harry (as aforementioned) takes it upon himself to fulfill this thing that's been hanging over his head. Dumbledore had said years before that the choices a person makes are what is important, so Harry chooses himself and lets whether Fate chose him or not hang.
<ul><li> Exactly. The oracle pretty much predicted the choices they would make. If both of them decided to screw destiny, they would, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">but neither will</a>.

</li><li> In one of the novels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em>, Svetlana gets fed up with Geser's "prophecy" (more of a calculation, really) and Anton's blind obedience to it. Essentially, she is supposed to end up with Anton and bear a powerful Other child. She ends up having a threesome with an incubus, while Anton is <em>sleeping in the next room</em> and then gets mad when Anton reacts with <em>understanding</em>, not anger. Geser's prediction <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does come true eventually, and the incident is forgotten</span>. Several later books deal with actual prophecies, spoken by rare prophet Others, who appear to be channeling Twilight itself. Unlike predictions, prophecies <em>must</em> comes true, as long as a human hears them. Until then, they remain in flux and may even be averted, if all Others, who know the prophecy die or become unable to tell a human. This is why, in <em>Sixths Watch</em>, a prophecy uttered by every single prophet on the planet claims that the world will end in less than a week, unless something happens. Both Watches scramble to try to figure out what must be done to save the world. Also, the witch Arina claims to have once successfully averted a prophecy, which has been heard by a human, saving Russia from being carved up by Germany and Japan at the cost of allowing it to be engulfed by communism. She is then told that she has merely delayed the actual prophecy, whose repercussions will now be <em>much</em> worse than they were supposed to be. She is horrified. Also, the prophecy in <em>New Watch</em> ends up being more or less averted, since no human hears of it. Also, the fear was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anton's daughter would kill the Tiger (Twilight's manifestation) and destroy Twilight itself, turning all Others back into humans</span>. This is moot as of <em>Sixth Watch</em>, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Tiger is killed by Two-in-One (another manifestation of the Twilight), and everything is fine</span>.

When the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> discovers that his local lover, whom he impregnated (proving that the sterility problem can be fixed), is about to terminate because of this</span>, he bursts into the main temple and carries a blasphemous sermon, claiming that the greatness of humankind stems from our ability to ignore our own prophets of doom and carry on anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It works, but is still subverted: he was actually fulfilling <em>another</em> prophecy about a man from space who will save Mars.</span>

<ul><li> In the true ending of both <em>Calamity Trigger</em> and <em>Continuum Shift</em>, its basically all about the characters trying to defy their fates, even the antagonist Terumi took out Takamagahara in an attempt to be free of their meddling control.
</li><li> <em>Chrono Phantasma</em> reveals that The Origin, the girl piloting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">Master Unit: Amaterasu</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is destinued to die at the hands of Ragna, her chosen hero. In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">crapsack state of the world</a> is ultimately revealed to be due to her inceasingly desperate attempts at defying this destiny and her subsequent despair at the realization that, even though she's practically omnipotent, it's impossible for her to succeed. In <em>Central Fiction</em> it's eventually revealed that only Ragna obtaining the Azure and using it to rewrite reality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">and himself out of existence</a> opens up the possibility of The Origin's salvation.</span>
</li><li> <em>Central Fiction</em> also reveals that Terumi is, in fact, the one who's been trying the hardest to defy his destiny. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">Destroyer Deity</a>, his destined role was one as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil">Necessary Evil</a>, so when he broke free from the Master Unit: Amaterasu's control, he found that there was no way for him to live without playing along with her wishes; he could either cease being evil and leave her creations be, like she wanted him to, or continue to destroy her world, thus doing what she created him to do anyway. This is also revealed to be why Terumi wants the Azure; so that he may use it to rewrite reality, make himself the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a>, rewrite his own destiny and turn the universe into a cesspool of hatred and despair.</span>

<ul><li> Though if hints in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> were any indication, their attempt to screw destiny altered the present time enough that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it screwed THEM over, got them all killed (except for Robo, but he dies near the end of the game), and turned Porre into a world superpower</span>.
<ul><li> Fortunately, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> solves this by having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Schala, who has been screwed by the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>'s screwing of destiny, screw destiny herself to make things better</span>. Unfortunately, this makes things EVEN WORSE, and the game goes through several cycles of attempting to screw destiny and either making things even worse or going closer to the original fate before they FINALLY get everything back to the previous game's "destiny has been screwed" world status, accepting an unfortunate fate for themselves in the process and not even bothering to screw this one. Yes, the game is somewhat confusing, why do you ask?
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CirqueDeZale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CirqueDeZale">Cirque De Zale</a></em>. Alexander does not care at all about the prophecy saying that he is destined to be a hero. No matter how hard fate tries to force him to save the world, he just does not want to be anything other than a circus ringmaster, even going as far as to deliberately ignore the imprisoned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> when he could easily save her.

They are told by a Sumerian Warrior Priest that they will eventually enter a collective conscious and go into a dreamless sleep, only to be awakened by those who attempt to awaken the Firstborn. Although the team initially accepts this and try to say their final goodbyes to each other, Delgado decides that Antadurunnu is bullshitting them, stating that all they've seen of their predecessors is them being stuck to combat hellish horrors for all eternity. He states that they should just try and kill the Firstborn itself to end the cycle, proceeding to shoot Antadurunnu in the head.
</li><li> Taking the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dark Lord/Abandon the Fire</span> endings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> respectively can feel like this, as you have decided to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> say "fuck it" to prolonging the Age of Fire</span> and instead seek your own path in the world, but it becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed Trope</a>. Ultimately, the choice you make doesn't actually matter on the cosmic scale since these same events will repeat themselves and some other hapless schmuck will eventually have to make the same choice that you did, although in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> your character individually <em>can</em> dodge destiny without affecting the fate of the world at large.

</li></ul></li><li> It shouldn't be a surprise that this is a core theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em>. Mankind is doomed, with the Guardians fighting an endless holding action against the enemies clawing at the Last City's gates. The Hive are awakening their general Crota for another invasion of Earth, the Vex are lurking among the ruins of mankind's remains, and the Cabal have a stranglehold on the system. The Future War Cult only sees death and doom and destruction of humanity in their future-viewing machines, and even Dead Orbit, the most positive of the human factions, is just looking to abandon the Solar System for another world. But Guardians wield the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Light of the Traveler</a>, which among other things allows them to defy the predictive models of the Vex, who can simulate entire universes down to the atomic level. Guardians can outright ignore Vex time control and ontological weaponry (which is essential to completing the Vault of Glass raid). And a hard-to-find set of in-game lore entries indicates that the whole reason the Vex are even active in the Solar System is because they <em>know</em> Guardians and the Traveler can ignore fate and probability, and want to weaponize it in order to save themselves from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the Darkness</a>.
</li><li> The <em>entire</em> point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> ups the ante, with even more characters fated for death...unless you find them and defeat whoever it is that's slated to kill them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Many of said characters are playable allies, so NOT screwing destiny can leave you with less-than-optimal endgame party options.</span> Hell, even the theme for battles where you screw destiny is called "Challenging Fate".

</li><li> The endgame of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> leads to a massive time loop over the course of 2000 years involving the battles between the Warriors of Light and Garland. The Warriors kill him in their first battle, and he is revived by the fiends, sent back 2000 years, and kills the Warriors when they come to fight him, before sending the Fiends into the future. This cycle (Warriors kill Garland, Chaos kills Warriors, loop repeats) has apparently happened over and over and <em>over</em> again. However, the Warriors finally go "Screw this, you die now!" and finally defeat Chaos, breaking the time loop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> has a couple of these. Garland tells Warrior of Light the war is destined to go on forever, and Warrior of Light replies with "screw destiny". Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garland is telling the truth - the war has been going on for centuries, and whenever one side loses, Shinryu revives them and the war keeps going</span>. When all the other heroes find out about this, the motto of pretty much the entire party becomes "screw destiny". In fact, it later turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the villains were hoping to end the cycle of war too</span>, so it's actually the <em>entire cast</em> following this trope, except Garland who loves the fact he gets to spend eternity fighting.
<ul><li> Made much more terrifying when you realize that, by screwing destiny in <em>Dissidia</em>, the heroes are quite possibly instigating the 2000 year Time Loop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garland's on his way to becoming Chaos in the end</span>.

However, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Aerith</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sephiroth</a> have, through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">The Lifestream</a>, become aware of how future events will transpire, and that if destiny is allowed to go on as it should, then it's going to <em>royally</em> screw over Sephiroth... so, naturally, he attempts to screw destiny first. And the easiest way to screw destiny is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">making the heroes attempt to screw destiny</a>, for example by goading them into starting the final boss fight against him within the Singularity, the Whispers realm, <em>way</em> before they're strong enough to actually win, thus forcing the Whispers to intervene, causing a fight to break out between the heroes and the Whispers that the Whispers cannot win without screwing up destiny. Aerith, in the meantime, is torn between giving up, accepting her fate and eventually sacrificing herself for the safety of the Planet as she should, or defying destiny and putting her faith in the possibility of an even better tomorrow at the expense of endangering the original timeline's much safer ending. She eventually settles for the latter and takes a proactive role in changing the course of events for the better.</span>

She's destined to die at the hands of SeeD, so she decides to compress time, absorb it, and become a goddess to make up the rules herself. This trope is also subverted because, as a response to the intense persecution she suffered for being a Sorceress, she became the very monster everyone said she would become which is highlighted in a <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hamtastic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech">speech</a>.

Killing him erases the cast's memories of the entire adventure, allowing them to live peaceful lives for two months until Nyx arrives and destroys the world. Not killing him means you'll have to fight Nyx...except that the story tells us over and over again that you CAN'T fight Nyx, since Nyx is death itself, and thus you're destined to lose. Our heroes choose to ignore this and spend the next month preparing for the final battle with the attitude that destiny can suck it and Nyx is just as killable as anything else.

<ul><li> Initially, in <em>The Sands of Time</em>, the Prince <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up going back in time far enough to undo the whole plot, thus leaving the sands contained.</span> While a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>, altering the timeline summons Dahaka, an unstoppable monster chasing him down to end his existence for messing with time, leading to <em>Warrior Within</em>.
</li><li> He attempts to counter by going to the place of origin of the Sands, in hope of finding a way to solve the problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">more time travel</a>. In there, he finds portals leading into ages long past and gets the idea to kill Empress of Time before she can create the Sands. In the game's midpoint, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out killing her is what creates the sands in the first place.</span> Thus he fails to change fate and Dahaka is still coming.

</li><li> The way that plays out differs between two endings. Regular ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he brings the Empress into the present and kills her there, meaning that the Sands are created but have no way of having been involved in his past adventure.

In the completionist ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>spares</em> the Empress and manages to fight Dahaka itself off with the mystical water-imbued sword. This averts both his <em>and</em> the Empress' destinies, and they sail off the island together.</span>
</li><li> <em>Two Thrones</em> takes a different point. While the beginning of the game is halfway between averted and non-averted fate because it happens in different fashion than was foretold, by the end of it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Prince learns to accept what has come to pass and stops trying to endlessly go back and undo.</span>

Later, freed of evil taint, he would assume the role of a prophet and maneuver the humans, orcs, and night elves into a position to combat the Burning Legion and prevent their conquering of Azeroth. Medivh further screwed with Destiny by giving his own son, Med'an, what he never had: the <em>choice</em> to become Guardian of Tirisfal.

Eventually he saw a glimpse of hope in Metallia who was possibly the only one who can alter that fate, and by the end of the "Bad" ending the world was saved by the actions of Metallia and the Hundred Knight. <em>Hell</em>, the entire canon ending was the protagonist trying to Screw Destiny that happened till chapter 11, hence the name "Bad" ending.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins">Goblins</a></em> deconstructs, inverts, and subverts this. Most Goblins are named by their fortune teller, who accurately names them based on their destiny. Saves-a-Fox became so fed up with this that she eventually killed the fox she was expected to save, and uses this fact to convince Dies-Horribly he can fight fate too.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later on, Dies-Horribly points out that judging by the description Saves-a-Fox gave, the fox had contracted a disease that would cause it to die a slow, painful death, meaning Saves-a-Fox really did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">save it by killing it</a>.</span>
</li><li> Also notable in that most of the "destinies" that the goblins are named after are on the surface utterly trivial (though they ultimately speak towards the holder's personality in general)—"Saves a Fox", "Complains of Names", "One Eye", "Fumbles", etc. The first reason Fox cites for her rebellion is that she won't accept such an insignificant event as being the most important thing in her life... Which, ironically, makes it... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">the most important thing in her life.</a>
</li><li> Also played with in that some goblins that are <em>supposed</em> to get prophetic names... aren't. Chief wasn't supposed to be the chief, he was only chief because his father was and there would have been a violent outcry if he hadn't taken the job. Complains' father, on the other hand, <em>was</em> supposed to be the new chief. So... the village's fortune teller deliberately screwed destiny to prevent a war... while at the same time weakening their tribe by having the wrong leader.
<ul><li> Mocked thoroughly, though, once we meet some of the goblin slaves, who have such names as "Piss off I have a Headache," named by the same fortune teller that also named another goblin "Stop the Ceremony I Swallowed a Bug." This is less of a "Screw Destiny," and more of "Our fortune teller sucks."

As he tells Danny, while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher">watchers</a> see Time as a parade, Clockwork himself sees the parade from above, and the roads it may or may not take</span>.

Fry the delivery boy wanted to be <em>anything</em> else, but wound up doing just that, while Leela, who originally figured her destiny as a job assigner was inescapable, became a starship captain.
<ul><li> Fry staying a delivery boy makes sense, as being a delivery boy in the future is a hell of a lot more awesome than being a delivery boy in the past.
</li><li> Career chips though were quickly forgotten about and through the years they've taken on any number of wacky jobs from selling poplers, to playing in Blernsball, to serving as emperor of Tri-Sol... in fact, the a later episode lampshades the forgotten rules of the first episode by having Leela say to Fry "You know, our <em>career chips</em>"? as he just stares blankly.

Warp insists that Starfire can't prevent any of this, using his theft as an example of time's immutability. She proves him wrong by getting the future Titans back together, defeating him, and then returning to the past with the object he stole, ensuring it never disappears to begin with.

He-Man gets to talking to it and realizes that Daimar doesn't particularly <em>want</em> to destroy the world, he just believes he <em>has</em> to because of destiny. He-Man convinces him he has free will, and he chooses to go home to his own dimension in peace.

At least some of the Rebels are rebelling because they feel destiny is giving them a raw deal, while the Royals generally like the fairy tales they belong to, but Duchess Swan and Maddie Hatter are acting out of their personal beliefs, not self-interest. Swan is a Royal because she believes in following the story, though she would rather have a happier ending than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake">she's due for</a>; conversely, Maddie Hatter is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadHatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadHatter">The Mad Hatter</a>'s daughter, but she doesn't believe people should be forced into a life they don't want, making her a Rebel.

<ul><li> This is one of the defining differences between modern societies and those from ancient times, whereas in the old days <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">war</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingShoes">famine</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">plague</a> were considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity">integral aspects of the cosmic order</a>, they are considered now technical problems which can be solved through social development, economic growth and technological development.
<ul><li> For that matter even death is no longer considered for some as the preordained destiny of mankind, the fact that corporations such as Google are investing their vast resources to defeat them speaks volumes of a change of heart at the core of humankind.
</li><li> For most of human history, peace was simply not in the stakes, even if there was no open war, rulers had to consider the possibility that the next season may bring at war with a neighbor nation. Nowadays, we can talk about real peace in the sense a British politician doesn't have to consider the possibility of war with the Germans when making the yearly plan, in fact, statistical research indicates we live in the most peaceful period of human history, with wars mostly localized in comparatively small regions of the world. In general terms, humans have more chance of dying in a road accident than being killed in a war or by terrorists.
</li><li> In the seventies, it was predicted a vast percentage of the world's population was condemned to die of famine due excessive population growth, and this was actually stated by serious, formal institutions. Enter the Green Revolution, directed by Mr. Norman Borlaug and funded by the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. In a few decades, they have driven famine from most of the planet through the development of new crops, with the amount of people saved from starvation being estimated at ~1 billion. In fact, we have been so successful, that now we have to educate people to not eat too much and to eat healthy.
</li><li> We have managed to wipe smallpox from the face of Earth. In other words, we have driven a virus into extinction. That said, the ignorance of some could be seen as a subversion to this: things like the Anti-Vax Movement are allowing viruses we've since beaten into submission to make a comeback, as if it really <em>is</em> our destiny to suffer such things.
</li><li> In some cultures, these catastrophes were even considered deities. In other words, in the eyes of ancient cultures, we have effectively killed gods.
</li></ul></li><li> Worldwide, our social fluidity and tolerance toward others is another point. For example, while in ancient times, it was unthinkable in India to see a denizen of the Untouchable caste move into higher hierarchical orders, the introduction of democracy has broken such reality. India has even had an Untouchable as a democratically-elected president.
<ul><li> Most peoples of the world started revolutions against what was called the Divine Right of the Kings, greatly diminishing their powers or completely replacing them with other governmental systems.
