Sometimes, the work is set in a time or place where military organizations were just not that disciplined (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">The Dung Ages</a>). Most of the time, it appears to be the result of lack of experience on the part of the writers on how the military actually operates.
</p><p>And sometimes, the apparent lack of discipline is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">whole point</a>: some military organizations in fiction land are not disciplined because they <em>do not need</em> discipline to begin with. Either the members are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">competent</a> or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">badass</a> enough so that "normal" discipline is not necessary any more, or the common cause they are fighting for and/or the charisma of their leader is enough to ensure their efficiency when it is time to get serious; in such cases, the Mildly Military organization is actually a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> with the size and the firepower of a standing army. If well written, it can impress the audience by letting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">apparently laid back</a> characters show just how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">frightfully competent they really are</a> and even make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">valid point</a>.

<ul><li> All iterations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> qualify. The Area 88 mercenaries are undisciplined and insubordinate compared to real-life mercenaries. And what's with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyConspicuousUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyConspicuousUniform">technicolor flight suits</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> The military is highly undisciplined. Hikaru and other pilots regularly talk back to their superior officers, even going so far as to insult them after being given simple orders. In addition, Roy Focker openly carries on a romantic relationship with a superior officer throughout the series. Hikaru especially commits all sorts of insubordination, including deserting his post to watch a beauty contest. No one is ever reprimanded for this behavior. Considering that they are in a crisis (aka first contact with aliens and a Space War), they probably let these things slide as they are minor compared to the bigger problems (aka giant hostile aliens), especially since humanity is desperate for manpower as is.
</li><li> Averted in other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> series: the military acts like the military and even minor infractions are dealt with harshly. It's repeatedly made clear that Isamu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em> is toeing the line for a dishonorable discharge, and the only reason he hasn't been booted yet is his borderline-inhuman skill as a pilot. Gamlin, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em>, barely escapes a court martial after he strikes a superior officer. Everyone, including his own superiors, agreed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">said officer</a> really deserved it, but that still didn't make it okay.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em>, where the main characters are part of either SMS or Chaos, civilian-run paramilitaries who deploy as supplementary forces. As such, they are not actually under military law and can get away with a bit more.
</li></ul></li><li> The military in many of the entries of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">original series</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, this was justified by the ship having an inexperienced CO and a crew that weren't technically military. In fact, Bright specifically explained to another officer in one episode of Mobile Suit Gundam that he tried to be relaxed about military protocol on the White Base in order to ease his mostly-civilian crew into their roles.
</li><li> In <em>SEED</em>, Kira gets court-martialed, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> reaches the verdict that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard">she doesn't have the authority to sentence a civilian</a>. The ZAFT military lets its best soldiers wear red suits and get away with almost anything.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> becoming a member of Faith gives them complete autonomy and unquestionable authority. Also notice that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniformOfSexy">Custom Uniform of Sexy</a> are allowed for Minerva crew, and Shinn is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">almost blamed for his lack of respect</a>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em> where military law is in full effect and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiro</span> barely escapes his court-martial, along with his (likely) execution.
</li><li> Similarly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Gundam 0083</a></em>, where Kou Uraki is court martialed for a year for his theft of the GP03 (no matter how much one thinks it might be justified, stealing top-secret military equipment is still punishable by death.) Captain Synapse took responsibility for it and was sentenced to death instead of Kou. He is eventually released because the Federation decides to do a cover up of their epic failure of losing almost half of their entire fleet (2/3 of what was present in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlauntingYourFleets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlauntingYourFleets">fleet inspection</a>) to their own nuclear launching GP02A and failure to intercept the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> afterwards. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianEditor">all trace of existence of the GP series were deleted</a>, Kou's sentence became unjust because he obviously cannot commit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype">Grand Theft Prototype</a> of a non-existent Gundam, thus he is released 3 months after the court martial.
</li><li> For some reason, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em> the crew allow prepubescent children to remain on board even when the ships are about to go into battle.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pdfy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0pdfy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pdfy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They clearly had opportunities to have the children taken off.</span> Apparently Bright Noa and Char Aznable don't see many problems with possible infant mortalities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em>:
<ul><li> Celestial Being. Justified that the organization is an irregular private militia, many of its members are non-military, and its people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">eccentric</a>.
</li><li> The A-LAWS, whose senior members sometimes carry "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>" Licenses, which is pretty much the authority to do whatever the hell they want, regardless of the commander's wishes or battle plans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Most of the license-holders are Innovators, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">wouldn't be inclined to take orders from mere humans</a> anyway.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, the Titans "have their own protocols," and refuse to listen to orders from regular Earth Federation officers. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Bright Noa</a> tries to bring them into line, they beat him half to death. On the heroes' side, the A.E.U.G. is fairly lax, too; while there is still some respect for the chain of command in the way of saluting and obeying a superior, they are far more tolerant towards backtalk aimed at said superiors (it may get you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan">"correction"</a>, but at least it's not a court martial), their dress code isn't that strict (the ex-Federation officers wear their uniforms, but they don't make any fuss towards anyone else over it), and half their forces are civilian/ex-Zeon volunteers.
</li><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em>, Bright has more-or-less given up trying to maintain discipline on the <em>Argama</em>. At one point, when Judau is going off on yet <em>another</em> unauthorized excursion, and Astronage asks Bright if it's okay, Bright replies with "<em>You</em> stop him if it's not." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The <em>Nahel Argama</em> isn't even a military unit, it's a partisan ship under Beecher's command, and discipline involves squabbling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> until he does the right thing.</span>
</li><li> On the flip side of the Universal Century, Axis Neo-Zeon is barely functional as an organization, and are held together more by personal loyalty to Lady Haman than by military discipline; individuals tend to screw around freely, subordinates either try to manipulate their superiors or simply disobey orders, and their commanders range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">treacherous</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">flat-out insane</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not surprisingly, Neo-Zeon eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">splits in half</a> when Haman's most powerful subordinate decides to take the throne for himself in mid-war.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em> displays both mild and hard military discipline on the <em>Diva</em> thanks to the generational structure. The first generation is mild, since the "captain" outright hijacked the ship, put a cocky hotshot in charge of the mobile suit squadron, and lets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Flit</a> continue to pilot the Gundam. Generation 2 has the ship under military authority and appointed captain, with pilots that have gone through proper training. G3 straddles the line with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">ragtag crew</a> (captain included) and veteran mobile suit squadron.

And that's the one that has a pilot in an open relationship with his superior. It's suggested that because there hasn't been a war in so long, none of the agencies have much idea on how to even act like a military anymore.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Nyotalia</a> characters are even worse, with their uniforms going beyond inaccurate and being mostly subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>.

His lack of, well, any sense of pride, dignity, or responsibility is responsible for causing half the crew to nearly descend into insanity. At one point, a GHOST becomes disgusted with him, and leaves. Death is mercy compared to living with Tylor. The section he works in is a dumping ground for the screw-ups who haven't quite screwed up enough to be court martialed, further contributing to the poor to nonexistent military discipline.
</li><li> On a similar note to the above <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> has a crew with...very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">peculiar character traits</a>. However, they are officially just civilians working for a heavy arms company, not the military (though they ally with military, who itself is pretty mild on the military scale), and the company wanted to build the best crew possible for their ship, ignoring all character flaws.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Time/Space Administrative Bureau in <em>Lyrical Nanoha</em> is organized rather informally. Not that they aren't fairly loose even for this, but they act more like a <em>police force</em> with expensive toys all the way up to a sizable fleet than they do a conventional military. Their interests seem to be solely in capturing criminals, peacekeeping, and disaster prevention/rescue, never in taking or holding territory.
</li><li> This is given a nice lampshade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, where during a conversation Hayate had with her former commanding officer, Major Nakajima, it's mentioned that while ace mages (such as Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate herself) tend to get promoted <em>very</em> quickly, the ranks are really there for show more than anything else. It's made obvious what is meant by that during the same scene; Hayate is a Lieutenant Colonel, and thus technically Nakajima's superior, but both of them act like Nakajima's the one in charge.
</li><li> Near the end of Episode 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, Vita complains that Nanoha should be drilling the forwards on walking and greeting, like they were when they first entered. Nanoha responds that if there's time to do that, there's more time for sparring instruction, which suggests that part of this is pragmatically focusing on actual performance rather than etiquette. This is made clear in a later episode, when Teana violates safety regulations in an attempt to score a win against Nanoha, and is slapped down <em>hard</em>; informality is acceptable, endangering the unit is not.
</li><li> Despite the fairly informal atmosphere, Nanoha, Fate and Hayate make a habit of referring to one another by ranks while on duty, at least while in front of people they don't know well. Similarly, the incredibly professional Chrono exclusively refers to his mother by her title with two exceptions- once when he slips up and calls her "Mom" while flustered, and a second time when her refers to her as his mother in passing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> organizations serve as the setting's military forces, albeit more of the "special" variety. The creator has said that one of his inspirations for the village of Konoha was a military base located nearby his childhood home. Many ninja are...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">odd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">there are plenty of 12-year old ninja</a> (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Naruto and Gaara</a> at least are both power equivalents to nuclear weapons even <em>before</em> much training on their part), and of all the teen main characters, roughly two of them actually wear their village's uniform.
</li><li> As seen in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fourth Shinobi War</span> arc, this is the status quo in peacetime. During wartime stricter command structures are put in place and the standard uniform replaces personal attire.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Simoun">Simoun</a></em> sibyllae are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">members of the clergy</a>, not the military. Both they and others consider it shocking when the military tries to order them around, or even operate jointly with them, in spite of their controling the near totality of their country's firepower.
</li><li> Virtually every aspect of the minimal military discipline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> is justified at one point or another, and averted in several cases. For one thing they're technically Special Forces with a very high success rate with a very limited recruitment pool, no expandability and little to no time to properly train or discipline new recruits. Despite that there is a clearly defined hierarchy (justifiably mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> elements) which is followed and the Witches do spend most of their time drilling, training or doing maintenance work and menial tasks, some of their other fun activities actually happen during their allocated leave. They are also aces with a considerable amount of propaganda riding on them, allowing some leeway in their discipline, although they still ultimately answer to military law.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> plays with this trope: the alliance, and <strong>especially</strong> the "Yang Team" are <em>very</em> casual: you will see them throwing parties, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1yYQ0VVPq0">drinking alcohol during strategic meetings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, going after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">every girl they meet</a>, and even making fun of their leader's (lack of) sex life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">in front of him</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em>'s protagonists always seem to get away with ignoring their jobs and leaving their poor commanding officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Colonel Volcott</a> to pick up the slack.
</li><li> Alex Rowe's crew in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em> are rather loose with military discipline, although they're more like a mercenary ship than a real military vessel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">NERV</a> fulfills many of the same functions as an Air Force or Navy, and is run and organized much like both. However, its personnel are allowed to grow long hair and beards, and dating a co-worker isn't viewed a problem. Partly justified: NERV is a civilian agency and not military. The romantic relationships maybe isn't such a bright idea, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">the usual stability of NERV personnel</a>.
</li><li> Played with throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em>. The eponymous group are often derided by the public and other military bodies for being this way, and it was because of this reputation that Oreldo joined. Given their dangerous missions during the series, this label doesn't really hold up, although the relationships among the protagonists does kind of fit the mildly military idea.
</li><li> Lieutenant Filicia Heideman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky">Sound of the Sky</a></em> runs her tank platoon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">as a family</a> rather than as a military unit, though there are several practical reasons for not running the unit as a more strictly military organization.
</li><li> Surprisingly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> Marines tend to fall into this. Aokiji goes off on his own to track down Robin, with the Five Elder Stars merely complaining that he should be mindful of his rank. Officers above Lieutenant (and even some lower ranking ones) are not required to wear the uniform, although the preferred uniform for higher-ranking offices is a suit with the "justice" coat, and there are no grooming standards to speak of. Discipline tends to vary between officers, as Garp doesn't seem to mind his men telling him to help fix the wall he broke while breaking in to surprise Luffy, while one soldier who objects to destroying a Marine battleship to kill Luffy immediately gets executed on the spot by Vice-Admiral Onigumo. Officers are sometimes referred to by name and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">-san</a>" rather than their rank. And these aren't even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">mavericks</a> like Smoker or corrupt officers like Morgan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KuroganePukapukaTai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KuroganePukapukaTai">Kurogane Pukapuka Tai</a></em> is a <em>huge</em> example of this trope. The heroines are part of the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy">nearly</a>) all-female crew of a Japanese cruiser in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, who run into a German U-boat (crewed mostly by women) and later a British destroyer (captained entirely by women). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Romantic entanglements ensue</a>. Not to mention the chief engineer challenging the XO to a fistfight over the placement of a crew member.

Frog</a></em>: Done intentionally, the squad is lazy and incompetent, and their only oversight is the reports Keroro has to send back to his superiors, in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">lies outrageously</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost">Mass Effect: Paragon Lost</a></em> shows a marine blatantly sexually harassing another marine as well as her violent retaliation in front of their CO without any consequences other than him being humiliated that she "shot him down." Rank barely seems to matter, the marines bicker about routine orders, and civilians are brought along on a mission without much concern. Given that the ME universe is usually shown to be remarkably egalitarian, it portrays the Alliance Marines as anything but the disciplined force we're told they are throughout the video games and other media.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, the Integrity Knights are the closest thing the human lands of the Underworld have to a standing army, but Bercouli, their commander, is fairly relaxed with regards to etiquette, as seen when he insists that Alice, his protégé and subordinate, not salute to him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bercouli</strong>: I decided all that tedious saluting and protocol was a waste of time for this army. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Fortunately, the Taboo Index doesn't have a rule that says "Normal folks must ensure that a knight is properly mollified before they speak to them."</a>

Of course, given the comic is set in a universe where battles can be won by "pose power", it is perhaps not surprising that the 101st Tank Crushing Battalion in no way resembles a conventional military unit.
</li><li> Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> is a frequent offender. Crowning examples include their highest authority being either an agent with no prior leadership experience, much less any idea what her rank even allowed her to do, or even more impressive, a young woman no older than her mid-twenties at the most. Of course, this was a political appointments, and such things do happen in real life... but more often in corrupt developing countries than modern First World states.

</li><li> The Autobots and Decepticons themselves are supposed to be armies, but they both have immense discipline problems. The Autobots operate a bit too much as a cult of personality around Optimus Prime rather than a functional military force, while the Decepticons, well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">obedience to superiors</a> isn't exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">their strong point</a>.

As such, Joes enjoy privileges like extremely lax uniform and grooming regulations. Joes sporting full beards, non-regulation haircuts and battle togs including baseball caps, sports jerseys, blue jeans, sunglasses and/or full face masks are pretty much par for the course. But the most egregious breach of military protocol is arguably the Joes' extremely loose observation of chain of command. Three-star army General Clayton "Hawk" Abernathy, by virtue of his appropriately high rank, pretty much averts this as the overall Commander and head honcho of the team. But Duke, G.I. Joe's First Sergeant, despite never accepting a promotion to a rank higher than E-8 (Enlisted), is nevertheless universally recognized as Hawk's immediate second-in-command and not only gives orders to officers such as fighter pilot Ace and Green Beret lieutenant Falcon, but also seamlessly assumes command if Hawk is ever missing, indisposed, or otherwise unavailable. Warrant Officer Flint, Hawk's designated third in command, is also guilty of this to a lesser degree.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> plays with this trope.

On the one hand the Evangelion squad members are allowed grow long hair, their commanding officer insists on them calling her Misato at all times, and some of them are dating despite of being members of the same unit. On the other hand their commanders expect obedience and demand discipline from them, Misato chews them out when they step out of line, and some officers think allow relationships between members of the same squad is a bad idea.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HERZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HERZ">HERZ</a></em>: Military organization HERZ is more formal than its predecessor NERV but it's still somewhat lax: a mere Lieutenant like Kensuke isn't afraid of mocking Captain Asuka Ikari, even when they are on duty, and most of staff talks freely and informally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OnceMoreWithFeeling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OnceMoreWithFeeling">Once More with Feeling</a></em>: This is actually a plot point. Shinji feels he is not integrated with the remaining NERV workers because they are professional and business-like whereas he is too informal and must come across as a little boy playing war games and then going home. So that he requests for the pilots wearing his own NERV uniforms.

Captain Kanril Eleya nearly always calls her command staff by their first names, and though she follows a semblance of military discipline when speaking to superiors she also isn't afraid to speak her mind. Her first officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">Tess</a> Phohl has two modes. She's perfectly professional when speaking as first officer, but when speaking as Eleya's best friend they chitchat informally about everything from holonovels to Eleya's sex life. Her science officer Birail Riyannis doesn't bother with it at all, even on duty. Specifically called out in the short "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Downbelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Downbelow">Downbelow</a>". It turns out it's Eleya's preference to run a loose ship, but that's contingent on the work getting done. In an address to the crew she threatens to dock weeks of pay from entire sections if individual crew are caught shirking combat drills.

Furthermore, the politicians of the Home Galaxy have made the seemingly-silly distinction that the Trans-Galactic Republic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">has no military</a>, only "protection" forces (Spacelane, Planetside). Hence, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">that technicality</a>, being "non-military" fits, even if the ships are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">huge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar">armed to the teeth</a>. Never mind that the legal system still calls it "Standardized Regulations of <em>Military</em> Law."

At the start, Franklin tries to defy this and instil proper military discipline in the ship girls, but having the minds of adolescents, it doesn't work despite his pushing for it. After a while he eventually relents, though it takes much persuasion. He later goes on to let slide actions that should have gotten the perpetrator brig time or worse.

While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction">STEC</a> was founded by the US Navy, not to mention all of its human members being part of the US Military, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">ship girls</a> themselves who aren't so keen on following military protocol.

Unlike most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em> fics, the US Navy shipgirl programme depicted bothers with regimentation.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThousandShinji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThousandShinji">Thousand Shinji</a></em>. NERV was pretty informal and disorganized, but Shinji changed that. Under his gradual influence, NERV became a more formal and serious military organization.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheSecondTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheSecondTry">The Second Try</a></em>. NERV is a semi-military organization, but Misato is very permissive with her subordinates despite of being a commanding officer. Gendo criticized her behavior when Shinji went against his orders.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LeftBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LeftBeyond">Left Beyond</a></em>, both CATS and the Omega go out of their way to make it clear that just because they have enough firepower to rival small armies, they aren't. The Omega are a distributed AI, so every human and posthuman agent reports to them directly and there's no need for a military structure (the Omega are also used as a Siri/Cortana expy specifically so that people won't feel intimidated by them during off time). CATS is basically a loose group of telecommunication contractors that happen to have access to super-science for the purpose of making sure that the internet never goes down, even in case of Apocalypse. They take their mandate very seriously.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LastChildOfKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LastChildOfKrypton">Last Child of Krypton</a></em>, NERV is a pretty informal military organization. This irritates Gendo, who wants well-trained puppets.

It's run exactly like an actual army: There's a strict emphasis on discipline and protocol, a strict hierarchy, and harsh punishments for everyone who defies the law, up to and including execution.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheNextFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheNextFrontier">The Next Frontier</a></em>, when one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainsLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainsLog">Jeb's blog entries</a> talks about his initial worries that the single career military officer assigned to an armed exploration ship owned by the civilian Kerbin Space Agency would have trouble adjusting to their much less formal way of doing things. As it turns out, Kurt manages pretty well: He's in the air force, who generally don't worry much about salutes and who calls who "sir" because it gets in the way of their actual duties when they're in the sky.

Pessimal</a>, the Air Watch is a reflection of air forces such as the RAF and USAF, which in comparison to their respective Navies and Armies are mildly military. The squadron assembled under the management of the City Watch is an offshoot of Sam Vimes' creation, which is even more mildly military. As it consists largely of Witches, the military structure is even more loose and token. But as far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Captain Olga Romanoff</a> is concerned, so long as the others remember <em>she's</em> in charge, that will do just fine.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> - James Cameron has admitted that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> came off as a lot less disciplined than actual Marines; rather, they were more a reflection of Vietnam-era regular Army conscripts. The behavior is semi-justified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Burke's plan to bring the xenomorphs back to the company</span> and the fact that the inexperienced Lt. Gorman is in charge. Some specific examples:
<ul><li> The Marines embark on a mission that may likely involve contact with unidentified, hostile forces, commanded by an unsupervised, inexperienced officer.
</li><li> Their uniforms and some of their weapons are decidedly non-uniform, with personal touches and decorations no actual military would allow. Though this was enforced by Cameron, to give subtle hints to each Marine's character.
</li><li> During the infiltration of the reactor, Vasquez and Drake disobey direct orders from their commanding officer (Lieutenant Gorman) and 2nd in command (Sergeant Apone) and re-arm their smart guns.
</li><li> After locating the colonists, the entire force goes out to recon an unexplored area.
</li><li> During their first encounter with the xenomorphs, the Marines panic like a bunch of schoolchildren.
</li><li> After Gorman is incapacitated and Apone is captured by the xenomorphs, Corporal Hicks is in command (as Ripley herself points out later). However, Ripley (who is a civilian) starts giving the Marines orders. Not only does Hicks allow this, but <em>the other Marines obey her</em>. Of course this one is just about justified by the Marines knowing that Ripley is an expert on the aliens, but still.
</li><li> After the existence of hostile xenomorphs on the planet has been confirmed, Spunkmeyer carelessly exits the drop ship, leaving it wide open for any xenomorph that might want to get inside. Naturally one does. It kills both Spunkmeyer and Ferro, thus crashing (and destroying) the drop ship and marooning the rest of the team on the planet.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Basic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Basic">Basic</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> had so many inconsistencies and non-military actions, that the film was hard to follow. For example:
<ul><li> Samuel L. Jackson's character wears the rank of specialist (E-4) and has higher-ranking people addressing him as "sir."
</li><li> Female rangers, though as of 2015 there have been female graduates from the training.
</li></ul></li><li> The horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/House">House</a></em>, starring William Katt, has several scenes that take place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>. In those scenes, the soldiers fall into the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> variety - no uniform insignia at all, haircuts that couldn't possibly be permitted, even in the most lenient units, and soldiers who don't look, sound, or act like anyone who has ever been in the military <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">all of which was perfectly common on the front lines of Vietnam in the final years of the war.</a>
</li><li> All of the military personnel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames">WarGames</a></em>. The only person who has anything that comes close to a military haircut is the four-star general. The rest of the members of the Air Force in the movie look like they haven't had a military haircut in months.
</li><li> The U.S. Army troops in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em>, especially the grunts, were rather sloppy about many aspects of military discipline and bearing, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> U.S. Army in the later years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em> wasn't particularly interested in "spit and polish", but being a Special Forces style group with a good track record they were given a lot of slack up until they were framed for stealing money printing press plates. The rest of the military is mildly military in this movie. Face spends at least six years as a first lieutenant for some reason when in real life, he wouldn't have that rank more than two years before receiving a promotion to captain.
</li><li> The First Earth Battalion (part of the U.S. Army) is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a></em>. Justified in that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Jedi warriors</a>.
</li><li> The Russians and Cubans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984">Red Dawn (1984)</a></em> appear to only realize they are soldiers after they're being attacked, then rarely show any evidence of training. This may be excusable in the beginning when they are attacked by the Wolverines, but after the first few attacks, they should have begun to act more like soldiers. This was mentioned in-universe, and explained as the garrison units being half-trained conscripts while the real soldiers were at the front. When the real thing is brought in towards the end the Wolverines are pretty much wiped out.
</li><li> The Recon Marines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeartbreakRidge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeartbreakRidge">Heartbreak Ridge</a></em> act as if they never attended Boot Camp and have no idea about military discipline. In reality, to get into Marine Recon, you have to pass a series of difficult tests. The NCOs and officers who allowed the Recon Platoon to devolve that badly should have been court-martialed for dereliction of duty.
</li><li> It's almost startling to see any order actually get obeyed at any point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em>. At one point, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">officer actually mentions</a> that Starfleet is supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">exploration focused rather than primarily military</a>.

Noticeably, he stops wearing a uniform and switches to a civilian suit, albeit one that looks a lot like his uniform. The closest thing they have to a command structure is him as "Marshall", then Mako in an unranked secondary role, and that's about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Supplemental material</a> goes into a little more detail, explaining multiple divisions and some of the intricacies of how they interact. Mako would appear to be the "Kwoon Fightmaster", in charge of combat training. The organization itself is the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> strangely plays it both ways. Setting aside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>, on the one hand the Federal Military is extremely strict with almost Spartan-level brutality in boot camp and summary execution by a field officer is threatened for desertion, and the chain of command is absolute. On the other hand the soldiers are severely undisciplined; the first attack dissolves into a confused mass retreat after only a few casualties, fraternization is encouraged by superiors, they throw a frat party in the middle of enemy territory seemingly without setting up a defense perimeter, and a rookie flight officer isn't even remotely disciplined for almost crashing an interstellar starship into the spaceport because of her arrogant recklessness on her <em>first field mission</em>.
</li><li> The Continental Army in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrossing">The Crossing</a></em> is this, being made up mostly of local militia with no formal training. Only the ranking officers seem to wear uniforms—with the exception of Colonel Glover, who makes a point of <em>not</em> doing so—and their artillery officer, General Knox, used to run a bookshop. General Gates actually points to this as a humongous <em>weakness</em> in the army, and it's not hard to see why given that they've been terribly beaten by the actual trained redcoats and Hessians up until now. Of course, they beat the Hessians at Trenton anyhow.
</li><li> Another example from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrumsAlongTheMohawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrumsAlongTheMohawk">Drums Along the Mohawk</a></em>, where all the farmers look pretty ridiculous when they muster for the militia. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">take a level in badass</a> later.

It's all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, but Lubitsch later attributed the poor reception of this film to German audiences of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic">Weimar Republic</a> not being in the mood for movies that satirized militarism.

<ul><li> There's an old joke about an American general visiting an Israeli military base. He's making rounds with the base's commandant (also a general) and glumly notes the total lack of discipline to his colleague, pointing at a private who just passed them without saluting. The Israeli general rushes after the private... only to ask if the guy is upset at him for some reason.
</li><li> There are a number of jokes from Russia that involve soldiers stationed near nuclear weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANuclearError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANuclearError">screwing around and causing problems</a>. One joke goes that a furious commander catches an officer asleep with his head down on the nuclear launch console. He wakes him up, and proceeds to grill the soldier about what he did wrong, the soldier then insisting that there's no problem as everything is fine. "Everything is fine? Okay. Tell me, then. <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">Where the fuck did Belgium go?!</a></strong></em>"
</li><li> Another one goes like this: "American and Russian submarines run into each other in the Pacific. They surface to give salute. American submarine sonar operator hears yelling from Russian sub: "Who threw a boot on the controls? Who the fuck threw a boot on controls?" American Captain tells Russians: "In the US we would never have such problem!" Russian Captain replies: "There is no such thing as US no more, WHO THE FUCK THREW A BOOT ON THE CONTROLS?!"
</li><li> Three female soldiers are ordered to paint a room at an Army base and the last order that the Sergeant gives is that they are not to get even one drop of paint on their uniforms. After conferring about this, the three soldiers decide to lock the door of the room, strip off their fatigues and paint in the nude. In the middle of the project, there comes a knock on the door. "Who is it?", calls one one of the soldiers. "Blind man" replies a voice on the on the other side of the door. The three female soldiers look at each other and shrug, and deciding that that no harm can come from letting a blind man into the room, they open the door. "Nice tits", says the male soldier, "where do you knockouts want me to put these blinds?".

<ul><li> The way the Global Defense Initiative is represented in the terrible official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>: Tiberium Wars</em> is appalling. Among other things, it had a Private being promoted to Sergeant <em>on his first day</em> out of boot camp, when he showed no exceptional skill or capability worth promoting him. Not just that, but that apparently the chain of promotion in the GDI military goes from private to sergeant... straight to lieutenant to captain (then possibly major). The only corporal in the book is a technician. One would get the the impression that the author got all of his knowledge of military hierarchy from skimming a few war movies. At least it's mentioned that Vega got promoted on his first day mostly to boost morale than because of anything he did. In fact, his immediate superior fought <em>against</em> the promotion, as Vega's achievements were based either on pure luck or skills he earned prior to joining the military (although it's not entirely clear why the second reason is bad). He is also promoted over much more experienced soldiers in his platoon, which triggers a lot of anger and resentment among them, having the exact opposite effect from what the morale boost was supposed to achieve.

<ul><li> The Possiltum military seen in the early novels is underfunded and undertrained, so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> that they're insubordinate and incompetent. Later, though, an enormous and highly successful Mob-trained army is assimilated into Possiltum's, and we see it from the inside ... and the viewpoint character who infiltrates it is insubordinate, makes trouble with civilians, hires civilians to perform military duties without authorization, ignores paperwork and willfully violates orders. The result? <em>Repeated promotions for "showing initiative."</em> WTF?

They certainly have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">much more oomph</a> than necessary for a strictly research vessel (it is explicitly called a cruiser, by the way) — their <em>recon planes</em> pack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">antimatter guns</a>, — there are mentions of uniform and the crewmembers routinely carry sidearms, but on the other hand...

<ul><li> Rogue Squadron fits the "do not need discipline" variant for the most part - off-duty they're pretty casual, but they are twelve of the absolute best pilots in the New Republic and deadly serious while prepping for and during combat missions.

He allows romances between squadmates, but public displays of affection are to saved for off-hours or light duty. When one Wraith attacks another in a brawl Wedge formally reprimands and grounds her, but later decides to lie about her involvement in an incident (just short of committing perjury) to keep her in his squadron. And when a rookie pilot slouches off after arguing with Wedge, he admits that he'd take that sort of disrespect from someone who's flown on some missions with him.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhulesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhulesCompany">Phule's Company</a></em> series, to a degree at least. The protagonist, Willard Phule Jr., is put in charge of the Space Legion's Omega Unit - the unit where "discipline problems" and other misfits are sent.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rein');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rein" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rein');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He displayed initiative and captured an enemy leader, unfortunately he didn't know there was a truce on. So they promoted him and <em>and</em> put him in charge of their worst outfit.</span> Things are very casual, even after he turns them around, but they do know which procedures need to be followed and which ones they can get away with ignoring (or just paying superficial attention to), and they make a point of showing their detractors that they <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> follow procedure to the letter when it counts. Omega company isn't actually that unusual in terms of this trope, however; the Legion is loosely organized (the uniform is officially "something black" for example) and largely consists of people who didn't make the cut for the regular army.
</li><li> The Night's Watch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, once you get to know them. Their numbers are, barely, kept adequate only through prisoners being sent their as a punishment in exchange for avoiding death, so this isn't a great surprise that many that even the volunteers and disciplined things are looser in certain areas.
</li><li> Britain's Aerial Corps in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em> series. Almost all of it is justified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">the nature of the series' dragons</a>. Dragon riders are too rare and valuable to be court-martialed for anything short of treason. Dueling is prohibited for the same reason. One particularly useful breed of dragon will only choose female companions, so by the era the story is set in, women can and often do hold high rank and leadership positions in the Aerial Corps. Dragons generally refuse to serve with any human but a companion who was present at their hatching but some can be convinced to work with children of their original companion, so officers, even female officers, are encouraged to have children. The constantly rumpled, disheveled appearance of the aviators, though, is just because dragon riders tend to pack in a hurry.
</li><li> The airmen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Havemercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Havemercy">Havemercy</a></em>. They all take orders from their captain Adamo, but there's no military rigor - just don't piss off Adamo too much, or you'll get "put on dog rations." This is justified, since when they're on the ground they're a mess, but up in the air they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">"so fucking deadly, so fucking precise."</a> As for obeying th'Esar himself...it's not uncommon for them to spit on the ground at the mere mention of their esteemed ruler. They'll fight his war, but th'Esar walks a fine line of disciplining them and pleasing them so they'll keep fighting his war at all. This is the way things have to be, of course - men with weaker wills wouldn't be able to handle the dragons at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterLightSisterDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterLightSisterDark">Sister Light Sister Dark</a></em>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">soldiers</a> of the Hames. It's somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that they are supposed to belong to a primitive society, but one still has to wonder what primitive society thought it was a good idea for officers to ride into battle with their infant daughters strapped to their backs. Not to mention the fact that Jenna has almost no experience in commanding anything, and it shows- in <em>White Jenna</em>, her army comes close to mutiny several times. By the third book in the series, they've gotten somewhat better, but next to the Garuns they still look like incompetent fools who shouldn't be trusted with anything more dangerous than a kitchen knife.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a></em> series the Alliance navy has become this after a century of constant warfare and massive attrition in the officer ranks. Neither officers or enlisted personal salute anymore and ship captains actually get to vote on the fleet commanders battle strategy. When Jack Geary is put in charge of the fleet he reintroduces saluting and makes sure that his orders are followed without any voting. His main problem is that he does not have enough senior competent officers to replace all the idiots and glory hounds who refuse to follow his orders. The only units who still maintain proper military discipline are the Marine detachments. However, even they are frequently subject to this due to the insistence of ship and fleet commanders on micromanaging their actions during ground and boarding engagements. It is a little strange that this is allowed, as Marines are supposed to have their own chain of command. Another strange (and idiotic) thing that appears to be par for the course is the fact that, whenever a ship commander is rescued from captivity, he or she immediately demands to be put in command of an appropriate ship. The current ship commander is expected to be reassigned elsewhere. Geary is incredulous and initially assumes it's a joke. After all, why would anyone replace a competent ship commander, who, likely, has a good working relationship with the crew, with someone who has spent months or even years as a prisoner-of-war, simply because of seniority? After all, the person who's currently in command of that ship has earned that right, and reassigning him or her in favor of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> would be an unfair punishment. The only reason the war's been grinding on for a century of brutal, bloody stalemate is because the military of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright">the Syndicate Worlds</a> are as bad or worse, with a command structure that's half feudal and half <em>office politics</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That a third-party is subtly playing both sides against the middle to keep humanity's two largest power blocs squabbling amongst themselves probably has something to do with all the above.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em> has, among its many things, a man who keeps intentionally getting court-martialled so as to get sentenced to dig ditches instead of go on the front lines. He also fraternizes with the officers.
</li><li> Some of the characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan">McAuslan</a></em> series, about the Gordon Highlanders shortly after WW2. The Adjutant (Executive Officer) - normally a "feckless young man much given to babbling" and one of a few Englishmen in a Scottish regiment. Vague, seemingly unmilitary, and unworldy, when he has to lead in the absence of senior officers and take command of the full regiment, he does so admirably, assessing the situation, barking good orders and delegating tasks to the right people for the job. The battalion as a whole really; the enlisted men, particularly the sergeants, run the place. As Fraser puts it:
<dl><dd><div class="indent">It looks terribly military, and indeed it is, but under the surface a Highland unit has curious currents which are extremely irregular. There is a sort of unspoken yet recognized democracy which may have its roots in clanship, or in the Scottish mercenary tradition, and which can play the devil with rank and authority unless it is properly understood.
</div></dd></dl></li><li> An example from the opposite direction - FT&amp;T in Anne McCaffrey's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowerAndTheHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowerAndTheHive">Tower and the Hive</a></em> series is suprisingly military for an organisation that is essentially a family-run transport company:
<ul><li> They have laws over and above those of other civilians and handle discipline internally
</li><li> They have a well defined chain of command that terminates with the head of state
</li><li> They are careful to make a clear distinction between speaking to 'Grandad' and speaking to 'Earth Prime, sir'
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous team of guerrilla fighters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>. They start the series as five ordinary kids given extraordinary power and aren't very disciplined at all. But as the war goes on and they gradually become combat veterans they slowly grow into this: team leader Jake begins assuming the mantle of command much more confidently while the others grow into their respective strengths. It's lampshaded by Marco in <em>The Reunion</em> when he inwardly notes that he has to stop himself from calling Jake 'sir'. It gets even more pronounced towards the end, when they encounter alien militaries and are explicitly treated as soldiers.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worldwar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worldwar">Colonization</a></em> trilogy, the US military responds to two officers being overly curious about their new space station by simply telling them "It's classified"... Actually, no. The word "classified" is never even spoken (in fact, both officers muse that being told that by a superior officer would be taken in stride and obeyed). Instead, the officers are <em>threatened</em> and, when that doesn't work, attempts on the life of one of them are made. Only one person actually orders them to stop their investigation... but he's not even in their chain of command, so he's not authorized to give them orders (Sam Yeager is an Army colonel, while Curtis LeMay is an Air Force general). One of the officers, an astronaut, tricks his way aboard the space station... only for the station's commander to seriously contemplate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">spacing him</a>. Oh, and the secret wasn't even that big to begin with and is revealed in short order anyway. Additionally, the astronaut is then told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>, although this is partially justified by the mission parameters. Considering the whole series is supposed to be military science fiction, it's surprising that Turtledove would get this so spectacularly wrong.
</li><li> The Alliance Fleet in M.C.A. Hogarth's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paradox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paradox">Paradox</a></em> military sci-fi stories act a bit more like Starfleet than any actual military. Somewhat justified as the Pelted based it on vague cultural memories from before the Exodus of human militaries, many officers on loan from the Earth Navy are dismayed by the lack of discipline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeonardRegime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeonardRegime">The Leonard Regime</a></em> is centered around an unofficial military.
</li><li> Frequently played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novels. Most of Cain's actual job description as a commissar consists of maintaining regimental discipline, but he's relatively laid-back about it since he's a decent guy who favors results over ironclad adherence to rules and regs. This especially includes his aide Ferik Jurgen, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen">perpetually stinky and disheveled</a> artilleryman whose surprising competence, literal-mindedness, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">being a blank</a> have saved Cain's ass many times. In <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>, though, even Cain rolls his eyes at some PDF fighter pilots who get a little carried away in a target-rich environment and have to be reminded what part of the enemy fleet they're supposed to be attacking. Cain's relatively lax attitude (and redeploying a company without specific orders but in accordance with strategic objectives) actually causes another commissar to drag him in front of a tribunal in <em>The Traitor's Hand</em>; the tribunal sided with Cain, and the Commissar in question ended up being investigated himself for wasting everyone's time and damn near costing them the war when he tried to arrest him in the process of saving the world.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewArcana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewArcana">New Arcana</a></em>. The Order of Neomages is part of the military, but distances itself from the Army as much as possible.
</li><li> This is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">"hat"</a> of the Gzilt in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHydrogenSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHydrogenSonata">The Hydrogen Sonata</a></em>. Citizenship is tied to military service à la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>: every member of society serves in the military forces at some stage in some way, and holds a lifelong reserve position afterward. However it has been a very long time since the Gzilt have engaged in any kind of combat.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> when Ender switches armies in Battle School: The new army is a lot less disciplined than his previous one, to the point that Ender wonders if the leader even cares. Arguably, this trope is true for Battle School as a whole, who seem to be under a lot less rigid orders than the rest of the IF.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Armies tend to be quite shambolic, if only for the sake of comedy — although it's also clear that conventionally disciplined, properly trained armies, which do exist, can be expected to had those idiots their butts. The presence of the trope is usually justified by the plots.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a>,</em> the Ankh-Morpork army is thrown together in a hurry (the place hasn't needed one for a while), by a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">upper class twits</a> who believe that breeding and ethnic superiority will be enough.
</li><li> By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>, Ankh-Morpork seems to have acquired a moderately well-organized army, although its discipline at the highest level is somewhat undermined by the presence of Sam Vimes, who holds the highest theoretical rank but who doesn't really approve of soldiering. In that book, the barely-military force is the group of Borogravian soldiers including the main protagonist; this is justified by the fact that the Borogravian army — in fact, all of Borogravia — is going to pieces 'Nam style, and these are a bunch of barrel-scraping new recruits being thrown into action with no training.
</li><li> In Lancre, the royal army is a noble institution that takes its job very seriously. Unfortunately, it consists entirely of Nanny Ogg's son Shawn, who is also the captain of the royal guard, the royal guard, the royal herald, the royal butler, the royal mailman, and countless others. This means that his battle tactics mainly consist of running off to find the king and queen so that they can give him orders that don't involve fighting.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular characters of David Drake's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HammersSlammers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HammersSlammers">Hammer's Slammers</a></em> are mercenaries loosely inspired by the French Foreign Legion, but they have pretty tight discipline and a defined hierarchy, Colonel Hammer tends to react to loose cannons by threatening to have them shot. Now, the regular armies of the governments that tend to hire them, on the other hand... Well, let's just say that they wouldn't be hiring the Slammers if they didn't need them.
</li><li> 1Lt. Youji Itami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate">Gate</a></em> is constantly accused of this, even by some of the more martinet members <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWhereSMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWhereSMyRespect">of his own unit</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, Chief of Staff Rumford purposely encourages a rather informal style of work among his immediate subordinates, because he wants flexibility and character rather than a Pentagonesque military bureaucracy. Part of this is due to his background in insurrectionary warfare, where he got used to playing a little fast and loose with the ordinary rules.
</li><li> The Hexosehr in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IntoTheLookingGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IntoTheLookingGlass">Into the Looking Glass</a></em> come across as this due to coming from a very informal species.

Nicholas Meyer was proudly made military sci-fi, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a> has it stated verbatim in his film that "Starfleet is a peace-keeping military armada" and (per Scotty) "We're not a military agency!". Sometimes characters within the story will comment on Starfleet's ambiguous position. However, all in all, Captain Kirk says it best:
<div class="indent"><strong>Christopher:</strong> Must have taken quite a lot to build a ship like this. <br/><strong>Kirk:</strong> There are only twelve like it in the fleet. <br/><strong>Christopher:</strong> I see. Did the Navy— <br/><strong>Kirk:</strong> We're a combined service, Captain.

As a result, Starfleet resembles a military service less than it does in any other incarnation of the franchise. The MACOs (Military Assault Command Operations), however, are essentially the 22nd century answer to the Marine Corps. While taking a few minor liberties, the MACOs observe military protocol, wear camouflage uniforms, and use real-world small unit combat tactics.

Make no mistake, they are very Mildly Military; but this is lampshaded and explained on a semi-regular basis, as well as being a frequent bone of contention between the SGC and their Earth based antagonists (who are occasionally depicted as having a point). For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> comments on his discomfort with an alien and an archaeologist being on a front-line Special Forces team, but the logic is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">since they get the job done they can get away with it</a>, and also the fact that their situation means that they have to play things by ear on a regular basis. Atlantis, meanwhile, was actually intended as a bunch of civilians with a military contingent, since no one had any idea about the Wraith. Thereafter, there are power struggles between the military and civilian wings of the mission (in the military case, mainly from outside - Sheppard, Atlantis' military commander, doesn't always do what Weir says, but he rarely does what <em>anyone</em> says, and after early friction, supports her unconditionally). However, the civilian contingent largely remains in charge, save for Carter's tenure, for various reasons: mainly, Doctor Weir's force of personality and hypercompetence, her popularity with both subordinates and residents of the Pegasus Galaxy, and the support of the now General O'Neill. After that, it was because of the IOA wanted Woolsey, their own man, in command of Atlantis.

</li><li> The Military Channel's <em>Special Forces: Untold Stories</em> shows re-enactments of operations conducted by real special forces soldiers. These are supposed to be the best of the best, but whenever they're on screen, they look and act like they've never carried weapons and behave in ways that makes them look more like new recruits than special forces soldiers. For example, any time two or more of them are together, they clump together like Cheerios, creating an easy target. This is probably not only the actors' inexperience, but also because the director is trying to get them all into the camera's view.
</li><li> In a second-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>, Sergeant Diana Prince approaches a controlled area. The male lieutenant that's guarding it asks her if she's authorized to be there. During the exchange, a female captain (who has never met Diana Prince) yells at the lieutenant and accuses him of pulling rank. The lieutenant apologizes and lets both women go. The problem with this is that no one involved realizes that the lieutenant was doing his job and the female captain was pulling rank, violating security procedures in the process.

<ul><li> Peacekeeper grunts and lower ranking officers like lieutenants were usually very military (disciplined and in uniform.)
</li><li> Captains like Bialar Crais fell somewhere in-between these extremes, with some captains adhering strictly to military protocols and others being much more like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> (Larraq).
</li><li> High-ranking Peacekeepers like Scorpius (whose rank wasn't given, but stated to outrank a captain) were given a lot of latitude as to how they conducted their duties. Commandant Grayza usually wore alluring outfits with lots of cleavage (though the actor playing Grayza stated that she interpreted this as being like a soldier whose fatigues are informally unbuttoned to show off their chest). The higher ranking a Peacekeeper was in the series, the more unorthodox their methods tended to be; they could even pursue their own pet projects, and were exempted from some of the totalitarian conditions that governed most troops' and officers' personal lives (like not being allowed to form emotional connections).
</li><li> "Special Ops" Peacekeepers, like Larraq's Marauder squadron, were noted by Aeryn as being (superficially) less disciplined than run-of-the-mill PK soldiers, and they could be seen to modify their uniforms with furs, medals, and other trophies picked up from their missions in the Uncharted Territories.
</li><li> They also made use of civilian research scientists and mercenaries, who could be Sebacean or other races, most of whom may have been some sort of indentured servants or slaves (like Linfer and Co-kura Strappa, and the Collartas from "Thanks for Sharing" and "Relativity".) Non-Sebacean mercenaries were sometimes apparently equals (the Coreeshi bounty hunters from "I Shrink Therefor I Am").
</li><li> In addition to this, the depiction of the Peacekeepers varied in the show from episode to episode between a Nazi-esque military force and an overgrown mercenary force hired by different civilizations to keep order. It's also been implied that over time they've become less of a benevolent police force-for-hire and more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Space Nazi Empire</a> full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a>.

The crew of the (clearly military) M2 expedition to Mars acts in a completely undisciplined manner, repeatedly violates their orders and as a result gets two members of the expedition killed. How General Winston could have considered them his top team for the job is beyond understanding.

In an early episode, the rookies are left alone when the officers have to suddenly leave, and none of them is designated as being in charge. This is ridiculous. In the real military, if as few as two soldiers are assigned to pick up trash, it will still be clear who is in charge.

The Rangers are ranked as cadets, there's a distinct and rigid chain of command, and in at least once case, a cadet is demoted for conduct unbecoming of his rank. However, the Rangers are given a lot of leeway when it comes to personal shenanigans and quirks—which is good, because they have a lot of them. This might be explained thanks to the A-Squad disappearing early on, thus leaving the B-Squad guys the only Rangers around for a while (though they eventually have extra Rangers joinup; the A-Squad reappear too, having done a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>).

Jen, however, does tend to keep the team on their toes with training and whatnot. The Silver Guardians, where Eric the Quantum Ranger works, by contrast, appears to be much more disciplined; it's explictly shown he gets promoted after A: getting his Ranger powers and B: the original leader gets badly wounded.

Shepard can get away with this because, as a Spectre, s/he's not answerable to the brass who would otherwise be his/her superiors, and one minor character who is critical of the <em>Normandy's</em> situation can actually be told off on these grounds. Shepard is also able to blow off the council in the first game because the politics are in his/her favor for awhile, but this changes as the series progresses.
</li><li> Alternatively, there are many dialog choices to snap Shepard's subordinates into line; the trope is still followed because these are almost exclusively Renegade options, which carry an unfriendly connotation, as opposed to a professional one.

Characters repeatedly point out that Cerberus has looser regulations (including, specifically, no regs against fraternization), with a general attitude of 'anything goes as long as the job gets done.' By extension, the new <em>Normandy</em> is also Cerberus-built:
<div class="indent"><strong>Shepard:</strong> This is technically a civilian ship. I'm probably lucky you're still wearing pants.
</div></li><li> In the third game, you can get away with this even more than in the first, right down to keeping an entire cabin full of fish and model ships (plus a hamster) while strolling around in jeans and, in the right circumstances, being romantically involved with your communications specialist or logistics officer. Mind you, given that you are pretty much indispensable at this point - half the galaxy respects you at least a bit, you've got at least one highly placed contact with every still-extant major galactic power except <em>maybe</em> the asari, the most connected information broker in colonized space is an old friend, the only other human Spectre (assuming they survive) is at minimum a personal friend, and both the head of the Alliance military and the leader of the Earth resistance will back you to the hilt - it's perhaps not surprising that you can get away with a few regulatory oddities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then, in <em>Citadel</em>, the Normandy is briefly taken over by a clone who is <em>much</em> more draconian about regulations, to the point of leaving a note that your hamster should be disposed of at an animal shelter. Shepard is <em>not</em> amused.</span>
</li><li> Joker is a much more straightforward example; no military in reality would ever accept a recruit with a crippling disease. Old knee injuries that have ostensibly healed can be grounds for refusal. His backstory specifically excludes any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> plot devices to excuse this with his skill; he's only the best pilot in the Alliance because he worked hard to become the best <em>after</em> joining up. Worse, one of the comics shows that he got his posting on the <em>Normandy</em> by <em>stealing</em> it out from under the original pilot's nose and proving he could run the test flight better, gaining the position through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">sheer audacity.</a> In real life, a stunt like this would end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison">very differently.</a> Lucky for Joker, the CO of the Normandy at the time (who was also Shepard's mentor, showing where they get it from) also leans towards this trope, albeit to a smaller extent.
</li></ul></li><li> Although they are frequently called an army, most sets of units the player assembles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> are just an atypically large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>. Most of the series justifes this, as these groups are rebelions (2, 2nd half of 4, 5, parts of 10), working for in-exile governments for most of the game (1/11, 8) mercanary companies (9 and parts of 10) or not actually an army, just a search team (early 4, 7), 3/12 and 6 don't have good reasons, but employ a greater precentage of professional soilders/mercanaries compared to the civilian heavy "armies" of most games. In 13, the Shepherds begin as a band of royally sanctioned vigilantes, but then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>actual</em> army is utterly destroyed by a neighboring kingdom</span>, seemingly promoting them to the country's official armed forces.

Dress code is tenuous, chain of command is borderline nonexistent, and the overall discipline of the members is less than you'd expect in stricter private grade schools. At one point, Zell only gets very brief reprimand for bringing a flying skateboard into Garden and riding it to a briefing just before departing on a mission. During the graduation mission, where you are evaluated on your performance, the rubric has some very odd criteria; ignoring orders or talking when you shouldn't is a 1 point deduction, while not saving a random dog you meet during the mission costs you 10 points. And since it's a game, there is plenty of leeway for horsing around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheGoldSaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheGoldSaucer">playing card games while on duty</a>.
</li><li> SOLDIER in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> seems to work like this. Sure, sometimes they act like one would expect a military to act (all the "Sir! Yes, sir!"s when Zack is giving his speech to the new Thirds, for instance) but most of they time they're hanging out on the SOLDIER Floor talking about girls, company gossip, or whatever else happens to come up. Considering the simplicity of the chain of command (there are only three ranks, despite what some fanfiction might assume), the probable youth of most of the members, and that one SOLDIER is almost an army by himself, this is somewhat understandable.
</li><li> The Terran armies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em>, both games. Then again, given that most of the line troops consist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">repurposed criminals</a>, this is hardly surprising.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transcendence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transcendence">Transcendence</a>'s Commonwealth has a case of this. The Militia will promote you to Captain after your first successful mission, Major after your second, and Colonel after your third. You can complete all of these missions in the space of a few in-universe days. The fleet is a little stingier, but it's still possible to go from nobody to Fleet Commander in about a week.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a>'s</em> Valuan Empire seems to avert this trope for the various mooks seen around. However the higher up the chain of the command you go the less militaristic it becomes. Seems that the Admirals are hand picked for their individual talents (or political connections) and once given command are free to do pretty much what they want to get the job done. Ramirez for example is Galcian's Vice-Captain at the start, dispite having no background in any military or sailing organizations, and then later given admiralship and command of his own fleet. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> version provides backstory that show Ramirez did rise through the ranks, starting off as a regular Valuan soldier and advancing rapidly due to his abilities.

</li><li> The post-ADVENT world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOMChimeraSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XCOMChimeraSquad">XCOM: Chimera Squad</a></em> has you take control of what appears to be a unit of the post-ADVENT XCOM organized as more of a SWAT team that consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn">a mix of humans and aliens</a> and seem to still not be at the same level of organization and professionalism as the UN-created XCOM of Enemy Unknown.
</li></ul></li><li> There's some question as to how professional your unit is going to be in the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> games. There isn't a lot of character <em>per se</em> until around the time of <em>Mechwarrior 3</em>. Before then, you played a member of the extremely martial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clans</a> for much of <em>Mechwarrior 2</em>, and the Inner Sphere based <em>1</em> and <em>2: Mercenaries</em> had very little interaction with the chain of command, though your lancemates in <em>2: Mercs</em> varied from military professionals to mouthy psychos—at least they'd obey orders. Come <em>3</em>, however, and you get your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> lancemates getting mouthy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, and not an awful lot of professional behavior out of people who are ostensibly professional soldiers on a commando operation of significant importance. This trend increases as the series goes on through <em>Mechwarrior 4</em>, <em>4: Black Knight</em>, and ultimately <em>4: Mercenaries</em>, where your character has a callsign, a personality, and a tendency to make cracks at everyone, including the people trying to kill him and the people who cut his checks. No, your lancemates don't get any less sarcastic and individualistic as time goes on, either. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">Tournament Play</a> for the games, every unit had their own internal rules, but the trend is that units favoring the Clans adopted a more rigid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRankSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRankSystem">Fantastic Rank System</a> based on the system the Clans use in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">the boardgame</a>, with players gaining rank by completing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Trial Of Position</a> against their clanmates, while Inner Sphere units are more egalitarian, such as the Knights of the Inner Sphere and 12th Vegan Rangers of <em>Living Legends</em> having no real leadership outside of one person to handle the paperwork for matches and a volunteer lance leader in each match.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Ace Online</a></em> makes it clear that the mercenary unit Free S.K.A. is said to have "more personal issues", but is just as good as regular Bygeniou army.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa">Tabula Rasa</a></em> was set with player characters as soldiers in a futuristic military/militia organisation. Being an MMORPG, none of the officers minded their Receptive subordinates faffing about rather than following their orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game is about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between three opposing factions, each composed of thousands of players. Some players can attain high command ranks, which in <em>theory</em> should give them some sway over players, but when someone starts barking orders over the command channel, they are usually promptly ignored. Mildly amusing when two commanders start broadcasting opposing orders (Defend so-and-so! Fall back from so-and-so!) then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControlIsOffItsMeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControlIsOffItsMeds">start yelling at each other in global chat.</a>
</li><li> There's also extremely lax uniform standards across the board, particularly in the New Conglomerate. As long as you wear something vaguely resembling your faction's colors (which includes the dreaded pink camouflage patterns) you're good to go.
</li><li> Certain outfits are built entirely around this concept. They have extremely open recruitment standards, and the only thing they really do as far as tactics is drop markers and hop onto the platoon voice chat and order everyone to attack or defend, hoping to defeat the enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">by swarming them with raw numbers.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a></em>, the Barton soldiers wear armor and keep players from going from Barton Town to areas they're not strong enough to survive in, but that's about it. They seem perfectly fine with giving civilians magic rings and letting them run around fighting animated objects. There's no indication of them even trying to go into surrounding areas and fight back against the Animated or protect civilians, at least one is shown wearing a <em>penguin suit</em> over his armor, and others ask players to do various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">fetch quests</a> like getting their lunches. Given what an utterly insane world this all takes place in, this is all perfectly in-character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em>: While it is ambiguous as to how military your unit is meant to be, the fact is that there is no standard uniform and many of the ship girls make backtalk or even flirt with the admiral and generally act undisciplined or unprofessional. Some of the lines imply the admiral returns the favour or outright initiates conduct unbecoming. The official RPG goes a step further by never mentioning any links between the player's organization and the Japanese government or military.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the game primarily takes place in a military academy, from the level of discipline showed by the typical student, you'd think that Thors was actually a high-end civilian high school whose faculty coincidentally happened to be almost entirely ex-military. There is no mention of PT, drills, or training exercises beyond duels supervised by the combat instructor. The behavior of much of Class I (the children of the nobility) is grounds for a disciplinary hearing for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, which never happens, despite the most egregious instance happening in front of a teacher after they skip their own lessons to barge their way into hers so they can pick a fight with Class VII (the playable characters). It's even mentioned that only 40% of graduates actually go into a military career (despite the fact that producing junior officers is the purpose of a military academy), and a good chunk of them go into the provincial armies rather than the national army.
</li><li> <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III</em> takes place at the Thors Branch Campus and training exercises <em>are</em> part of the curriculum there. This is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the game.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rean</strong>: Then on top of that, training exercises were added to their curriculum. We didn't have anything like that at the main campus. Thors' branch campus... I think I'm starting to understand what the government's trying to do here.
</div></li><li> Despite the emphasis that the branch campus is more militaristic than the main campus was when Rean attended, the attitude of the students still doesn't seem appropriate for a military school. During Panzer Soldat training in Chapter 1, Ash steals the Hector <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroNoKiseki">Instructor Randolph</a> was piloting, and challenges Rean to a one-on-one fight. He does this by attacking Rean unprovoked, forcing Rean to fight back. Despite this, the most he gets is a warning for his behavior. Then there's the field study in Sutherland, in which Rean orders the new Class VII to stay behind at camp while he deals with orders he was given by the imperial government. He orders them to stay behind because they are too inexperienced to help him out. With the help of Ash, the new Class VII leaves the camp, and also takes one of the Soldats with them to help out Rean. When Rean's scolding the new Class VII for their actions, he even tells them that if they were real soldiers, their actions would've gotten them court-martialed. However, Rean's old classmates point out how they used to defy orders all the time, making him look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrite</a>. This doesn't change the fact that they did defy orders and stole expensive military equipment, making it more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriteHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriteHasAPoint">Hypocrite Has a Point</a> on Rean's part.

In-game dialog indicates that most soldiers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">joined up for money</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">to provide for their families</a>. Since Kyrat has no real infrastructure, they receive no real training or uniforms, with some soldiers wearing civilian clothes, and the ones who do wear uniforms look sloppy and disorganized at the best of times. As you progress in the story, many soldiers desert.
</li><li> The Freedom faction of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> are basically heavily-armed anarchists. They have no real rank structure and very few rules, so members casually refer to each other in a friendly manner and do whatever they feel like doing (or what they're good at). Alcohol and marijuana consumption is also common. However they're still a highly capable paramilitary force and able to give their main rival Duty a run for their money (Duty are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">by contrast</a> <em>very</em> militaristic and professional - in fact most of them are ex-soldiers).
</li><li> The Kataris 26 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconWildlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconWildlands">Ghost Recon Wildlands</a></em> generally go into battle wearing brightly colored clothing consisting of an open shirt, baggy pants, a knit cap with ear flaps, pom-poms and tassels, which makes it look like your back-up consists of a group of militant co-ed campus stoners. The group's second in command dresses like Mr. Rogers. Only Pac Katari, their leader, dresses in a combat uniform.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em>, your officers don't adhere to any kind of uniform or armament standard, preferring to wear whatever they're comfortable with (suits, pimped-out dresses, ceremonial robes, lab coats, longcoats, bikini tops, <em>the actual uniform of the enemy</em>...) and stick with their preferred weapon of choice. This is because they are unusually gifted individuals rather than rank-and-file troops, and would probably not have joined were it not for the unusual charisma of the protagonist. The <em>actual</em> soldiers wear proper uniforms.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> with the Guardians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em>.
<ul><li> Being a collection of... <em>colorful</em> personalities brought back from the dead from a wide range of locations and environments whose sole unifying trait is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">their ability to kill huge numbers of enemies</a>, and made up of a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">conventional if punch-happy</a> Titans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Warlocks, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">free-spirited, authority-defying</a> Hunters, it's difficult to keep them organized into a real military force. Instead they operate like a loosely allied collection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant">Knight Errant</a> warriors who roam the system and fight the enemies of humanity.
</li><li> The Vanguard, the leadership of the Guardians, chose instead to "organize" the Guardians around various incentives to make them want to carry out their missions, mostly in form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">loot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">glory</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">challenge</a>. instead of conventional training, Guardians are put through the Crucible, a live-fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport">Blood Sport</a> competition where they fight and kill each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">endlessly</a> to hone their skills. Instead of organizing conventional military offensives, the Vanguard fight with targeted guerilla attacks and "strike" missions that go after enemy high value targets, which results in the enemy being too disorganized and weak to threaten humanity.
</li><li> The Guardians' Mildly Military nature is directly contrasted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans">vastly more militarized and organized Cabal</a>, who occupy vast swathes of territory and build massive fortresses and have intensely disciplined and ordered troops... but who are unable to cope with the sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">mobility</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">Resurrective Immortality</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">destructive firepower</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyones">unconventional tactics</a> of the Guardians, not to mention the even more esoteric and strange threats of enemies like the Hive and the Vex. As a result, while the Cabal are able to gain temporary superiority, they eventually always end up being mired in something akin to an endless Vietnam War-style slog on Mars, on board the massive Hive Dreadnaught, and later on when they attack Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> Blackwatch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> have no ranks or protocol, belittle and mock their officers, and deliberately use improper radio terminology ("kill confirmed, over aaaand oouuuuut."). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">sequel</a> takes it up to eleven for laughs, Blackwatch goons can do pretty much whatever they want as long as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">shoot anybody who looks at them funny</a>.
</li><li> The Grey Wardens of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> have an extremely loose rank structure and don't appear to have any real ceremonial customs or courtesies the way the national militaries in the setting do. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> for a few reasons: they are a small, disparate, and decentralized force<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ixx7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ixx7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ixx7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A senior warden remarks that there's only a few dozen to a few hundred in most nations, with only the Anderfels (their home base) having more than a thousand</span>; a non-trivial number of their recruits come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">criminals, runaways or apostate mages</a>; they owe allegiance only to themselves, and hence operate more like a small mercenary company than a military; and they have a such a single-minded purpose (defeating Blights and destroying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">darkspawn</a>) that furthering that goal trumps any other concerns a million times over.

Some are more disciplined than others, but they are all ultimately driven by the money and power of their corporate masters rather than real military discipline.
<ul><li> The Dahl corporation prides itself on being highly militarized and emphasizing their weapons and products as being ideal for professional military use, and their corporate troops are extremely disciplined and dedicated - so much so that they're willing to keep fighting for a cause for years on end. This is unfortunate, because while the soldiers of Dahl are very disciplined, Dahl's corporate leadership are a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a>.

</li><li> The army of Atlas, the Crimson Lance, is well-trained and highly disciplined as well, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc">because of an absurd level of incompetence and nepotism at the top levels of Atlas</a>, they are completely hamstrung and their soldiers turned into more brutal and undisciplined thugs. It got to the point that a CEO named his <em>three-year-old son</em> a Crimson Lance admiral, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">General Knoxx</a> was nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by having to deal with it all.
</li><li> Hyperion's army is a mixed bag. On the one hand, their troops are elite and well-equipped, but they have very few flesh-and-blood soldiers. The majority of Hyperion troops are actually unstable AI-driven Loader robots or civilian engineers. The Hyperion army depends heavily on its ability to throw hordes of fanatical engineers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> at their enemies.
</li><li> The Vladof corporation has a very large and well-equipped army, but according to Moze's bio, they like to screw over their soldiers with bizarre contracts and commanders who change the terms of their contracts on a whim, and then chuck their troops into battles where they have no idea what's going to happen.
</li><li> Maliwan's army is effectively just a horde of brutal thugs who are little better than bandits, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">psychopaths who compete over who can be the most evil.</a> Their main claim to effectiveness is the sheer tech advantage they have, with highly-advanced weapons, armor, and transportation equipment.
</li><li> The Torgue corporation doesn't even have an army. They throw guns to their workers - who themselves are little more than bandits - and watch the ensuing carnage as half their workforce kills itself.
</li><li> The Jakobs corporation has the advantage of not having an actual army, just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBandOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBandOfMisfits">Ragtag Band of Misfits</a> made up of various mercenaries, smugglers, and particularly skilled Jakobs employees.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Blood Gulch crew is almost completely incompetent in every aspect, and apart from Sarge, no one cares about the "war" between the two sides. On the Red Team, Grif sometimes outright refuses orders from Sarge, while Blue Team has no commanding officer at all, they're all privates. This is justified, though - <em>Reconstruction</em> reveals that the Reds and Blues are made up of expendable washouts for use as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> in Project Freelancer's live-fire simulations. And outside of Blood Gulch, the other Red and Blue teams take their jobs more seriously, to the point that the Blood Gulch crew's usual antics saw Caboose put in the brig and Grif and Simmons facing a firing squad.
</li><li> Even the Freelancers, the results of an experimental and elite military program, are fairly lax about things, and are mostly left to do what they like how they like it. They still get orders (such as Wash's orders from Recovery Command), but they aren't really checked up on all that often, which shows very poor judgment on Command's part, considering the trouble they all get up to. Even in the group's glory days, as seen in <em>The Project Freelancer Saga</em>, the presence of a leader board in the project meant that the Freelancers spent more time acting like competing individuals instead of a proper squad, which is part of the reason why the group fell apart.

Those kingdoms already have their own military and police forces, which are as regimented as would be expected, but Huntsmen are actually <em>encouraged</em> to be as free-spirited, distinct, colorful, and individualistic as they can be without sacrificing efficiency. This is because eighty years before the setting's present, the world was wracked by a simultaneous interstate conflict, fascist uprising, and a struggle for civil rights, and the survivors took up a tradition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorfulThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorfulThemeNaming">Colorful Theme Naming</a>, to remember they had fought against fascists who wanted to stifle all forms of art and self-expression.

The uniforms are quite stylish, a large diversity of hair (including facial hair) styles seem to be acceptable and officers are quite friendly. The Norwegian army can be best described as having gone "full viking" and a Danish admiral doesn't mind an exploration mission used for a cover for illegal looting of ancient books leaving from his base.

They're even given basic training including firearms, despite the fact that most of them are more lethal than the average tank. That being said, supers are incredibly rare, so the team is forced to take what they can get. It seems like ninety percent of them spend half their time in remedial PR courses. On the plus side, dress code is relaxed.

But another case could be made, that every member is participating in an elite special forces team, and are therefore exerting special forces privileges to express visible distinctions in uniform and hairstyle. Because those unshaved beards have to be earned.

It's justified a little by <em>both</em> the common reasons, her squad is both a special forces division and straddles the line of military/civilian, and Rainbow Dash has delivered a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speeches to her about these tendencies.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverhawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverhawks">Silverhawks</a></em>, most of the main cast has military ranks but this appears to have little bearing on their roles on the team. The highest actual rank is held by their pilot (Colonel) Bluegrass. But he clearly reports to Commander Stargazer and (Lieutenant) Quicksilver. Nobody really bothers with uniforms or most protocol.
</li><li> Nigh-universal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> series.
<ul><li> The Autobots we see are almost always a military contingent... and always act like they're just guys on vacation. Particularly notable with the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Bumblebee</a>, who generally acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a> on a military mission who somehow managed to get a formal rank instead of being shooed away or receiving proper training. Even when there <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">proper training</a>, he will act like he just got out of elementary school and doesn't feel like doing his homework today.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, the Autobots on Earth are a close-knit group who acknowledge Optimus Prime as their leader but don't bother to stand on ceremony; he's very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> in one instead of a regular military leader, it helps that the 'Bots have so much respect for him. Plus, they've been together longer than humans have existed; Arcee even calls them a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">family</a>" when asked if Bumblebee was her friend.
</li><li> As bad as the Autobots can be, they still aren't the Decepticons. When an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">inclination to disobey orders</a> is considered a valuable trait for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">second in command</a>, discipline is going to suffer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that the Autobots aren't so much an army as an <em>ethnicity.</em> They've had to militarize their entire culture out of necessity, but that militarization doesn't necessarily run very deep. As for the 'Cons, they've always operated more like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">oversized street gang</a> than a proper army.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Ultra Magnus</a> is introduced to the Autobots, his hardass attitude clashes notably with the rest of Team Prime, particularly Wheeljack. Mercifully, he lightens up a bit.
</li><li> Also justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, where Optimus's crew are not, in fact, military. Prime is a military academy washout, Ratchet is a semi-retired medic, Prowl actively avoids military service for philosophical reasons, and Bumblebee and Bulkhead are just low-lever slacker drones. The military Autobots that show up later are more professional, if still not that firm in discipline, but they tend to be the Autobot equivalent of Special Forces (see Real Life below).
</li></ul></li><li> Villainous example: the Horde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> is run in such a slapdash fashion that when one Force Captain, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically Scorpia</span>, just <em>up and leaves</em> in the fourth season, it takes the Horde leadership several days to actually notice, including multiple days when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> was actually supposed to be working.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> An awful lot of special ops units can look like this to the casual observer - generally because anyone who can pass selection is self disciplined and motivated enough that they don't need to be ragged about by spit-and-polish NCOs. The key here is that special forces, by definition, don't operate <em>en masse</em>, so they have their own rules that are more relevant to their unique situation.
<ul><li> They also, due to their role, don't adhere to the same hygiene disciplines that other soldiers need to adhere to. They are often behind enemy lines, or far ahead of regular units, so asking them to bathe and shave on a regular basis would be dumb. That's why there are so many photos out there <a class="urllink" href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4mf2jybWd1qiz36go1_1280.jpg">of special forces operatives<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://static.stuff.co.nz/1233108507/207/714207.jpg">with scruffy hair and beards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> somewhere between "lumberjack" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop">ZZ Top</a>." Special forces also often need to blend in with the local populace, and in most Muslim-majority countries (where special forces tend to have been deployed in the early 21st century), that usually means beards.
</li><li> In addition, in high tier spec ops groups like the Delta Force and DEVGRU, the members are made of mid to high rank NCO themselves (you need to already be an experienced soldier to even be considered for such units), making discipline even more unnecessary.
</li><li> A documentary crew visiting the Canadian Special Operations Regiment were surprised when a corporal stated matter-of-factly that members of the unit normally operated on a first name basis from the lowest-ranked enlisted member to the lieutenant-colonel commanding it except in ceremonial or formal occasions.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Air Force is often considered "military-lite" by the other branches, but this is neither new nor unique to the United States. Rather it seems to be endemic to air forces in general. Winston Churchill once referred to RAF airmen as "uniformed civilians" during the Second World War. There are several reasons for this: the physical requirements and level of danger are generally lower (especially in the 21st century). Actual fighting is overwhelmingly done by a comparatively small number of officers, with most enlisted personnel regulated to maintenance and support. Air forces must operate out of airbases, ensuring a minimal level of creature comforts for personnel stationed there (and indeed creating an expectation of such). Everyone tends to have a specific task to perform, leaving fewer occasions where giving orders is necessary. The chance that these tasks will have to be performed under direct fire is also extremely low. The result of all this being the emphasis on discipline and subordination to superiors is considerably relaxed. However this is all by comparison to other branches. For <em>actual</em> civilians, life in the air force will still seem highly regimented.
</li><li> A number of auxiliary units have a history of just being civilian amateurs doing a job when their expertise is needed by the military and then being given uniforms and being put into the command structure e.g.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noaa_corp">NOAA Corps<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has its roots in the Corps of Discovery with Lewis and Clark. It was made into a uniformed service during WWI due to the need for coastal surveyors. If captured, they would be classified as prisoners of war and couldn't be tried for espionage. However the service is not military and maybe the closest to Starfleet, including having only officers and no enlisted. Their purpose is currently to support NOAA's efforts. These are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">the guys who fly airplanes into hurricanes to take measurements for the National Weather Service</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps">The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a uniformed service for the same reason (PHS Officers serving in war zones will receive POW status and protections if captured).
</li><li> The US Air Force's Auxiliary, the Civil Air Patrol, is made up entirely of volunteers, many of whom use their own aircraft to support search and rescue, disaster relief, Air Force training exercises, etc. And although it is a auxiliary of the Air Force, it technically is only such when the aircraft is being used on a Air Force mission, otherwise it is a private, non-profit corporation.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Auxiliary_Radio_System">The Military Auxiliary Radio System<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an all-volunteer group of amateur radio operators.
</li><li> Skippy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippysList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippysList">Skippy's List</a></em> (according to his <a class="urllink" href="http://skippyslist.com/about/">about page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) was in PSYOPS, mostly as an illustrator. Basically, he drew propaganda posters for the Army (in post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars">war</a> Bosnia, apparently). So yeah, more or less Mildly Military. He was an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Airborne</a></em> Illustrator. He couldn't tell you why the Army felt they needed an illustrator to be airborne qualified though.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Lighthouse Board (1852-1910) was like this as well. It consisted of uniformed Army and Navy officers who oversaw lighthouses, but of course their expertise was primarily technical and logistical. The postings were often relatively comfortable, with each officer having his own house at the post, and allowed to have his family live with him.
</li><li> During WWII, the Army Air Force created the First Motion Picture Unit for the purpose of creating training and propaganda films. Most members of the unit were civilians specifically recruited for their background in the film industry, and thus many were above normal military recruiting age or were otherwise unfit for combat. Basic training for this unit was greatly simplified, and protocol barely followed, since many of the members had known each other on a first name basis for years from working together in the private sector.
</li><li> The Israeli Defence Forces tend to act like uniformed civilians when off duty. Discipline is much more strict while actively serving, at least for combat units. It's just that in such a small country and with universal conscription, they get a lot of off time, usually to go home for a weekend or holiday—that is, unless intel says they need to be on alert. During these off days, they are essentially uniformed civilians (this typically does wonders for morale).
<ul><li> Non-combatant bases (most notably <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HaKirya">the Kirya<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) also tend to have a very informal attitude about them, unless theyve a lot of work to do.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5gw10');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5gw10" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5gw10');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The IDF is particularly notorious for its constant internal bickering, resulting in a rift between various corps. This can result in some offices having four secretaries with virtually no work, and another with one secretary collapsing under the pressure of four secretaries work, as the head of one corps was better at gaining more human resources, and the unprofessional (as they were conscripted and not hired) people handled managing them half-assedly.</span> However, they still have to make sure their uniforms are proper and not be seen drinking in uniform, lest the hated Military Police or just a mean-spirited officer catch them and bring them to military court. Also, breaking minor laws like jaywalking can also get them doubly screwed when in uniform. In fact, IDF personnel carry their weapons <a class="urllink" href="http://tokicollection.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/israel-part-one-chu-chu-my-camel-friend-from-israel">when they're off-duty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://hubpages.com/politics/Israeli-Girl-Soldiers-in-Bikinis">out of uniform<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Merchant Marine is arguably like this (as are most country's merchant navies). While in and of itself a civilian career, Merchant Marine cadets and officers must wear naval-style uniforms and abide by military custom and are obligated to become a part of the United States Navy Reserve.
</li><li> Paramilitary forces are usually like this, due to not being a proper military, and having laxer disciplinary standards. Some of the more professional ones defy this trope however, and are much more effective for it.
</li><li> The Republican soldiers in the party and union militias in the Spanish Civil War count. Heck they elected officers and could hand in their guns and leave at any point, at least before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">commissars</a> arrived from the Soviet Union.
<ul><li> The armies of the French Revolution also had elected officers as did the Union army for much of the American Civil War. There are many aspects of the Spanish militias which fits this trope, but not having a military hierarchy imitating 17th century monarchist forces is not one of them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the U.S., high school JROTC (when not at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool">Military School</a>) is often this. Even in the top ten percent of programs, there are units that don't even do a military salute. Same goes for other paramilitary organizations affiliated with the U.S. military aimed at youths - Sea Cadets, Civil Air Patrol...
<ul><li> Even at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool">Military School</a>, it's often this. No matter how many restrictions there are on what cadets are allowed to do, there will be all manner of stupid things done in barracks.
</li><li> Same with the Citizen Advancement Training (formerly Citizen Army Training) in the Philippines.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron">American Volunteer Group</a>, also known as the Flying Tigers, was a mercenary organization created with the tacit approval of the US Government. Claire Lee Chennault, the man who organized the group, figured that strict military discipline was not a good idea, since men who would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">take the opportunity</a> to resign from their branches of service and travel around the world to fight for the Chinese would not accept a hard-nosed approach. From John Toland's book about them:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"> "Uniforms were not worn . . . Though there was no rank and no-one was required to salute, it was the rare man who didn't address Chennault as 'Colonel' and salute. But when the work day was over and the men played baseball or volleyball . . . when [Chennault] acted as umpire, it was a common sight to see some mechanic screaming at him in rage when he called out on strikes."
</div></dd></dl></li><li> The U.S. Army in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> suffered from a bad case of this. Films set during the War show military units that are barely wearing uniforms, soldiers high on drugs, with rock bottom morale. The army was falling apart and filled to the brim with unwilling conscripts, discipline had gone completely to hell, the percentage of heroin-addicted soldiers had reached the double digits, and killing your own commander was so common as to get its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">Deadly Euphemism</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">fragging</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61ymc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note61ymc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61ymc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Grenades were used as bullets can be traced back to the gun with ballistic testing, in addition placing a grenade pin in the officer's tent can serve as a warning.</span>
</li><li> A French military joke from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> goes about how an officer was complaining about the poor state of upkeep of a forward post during an inspection. The post commander, slightly annoyed, merely commented "When I am a guest, I am polite enough to not complain about the host's house." Similarly it was common towards the end of WW1 for some of the worse off armies (e.g. Austria-Hungary) to have only one presentable dress uniform shared by all officers within a company or even a battalion for when they were summoned to HQ.
<ul><li> Two of Murphy's Laws of Combat state "No combat-ready unit has ever passed inspection" and "No inspection-ready unit has ever passed combat."
</li></ul></li><li> The most significant mutinies in the British armed forces in WW2 were partially provoked for reasons mentioned above. In September 1943, after four years of war, some British soldiers who had been fighting continually since 1940 were firmly of the opinion that they had done their bit and that new units being raised in Britain should be sent to relieve them. This came to a head when some units <em>were</em> selectively rotated back to the UK in preparation for the invasion of France. Men from these units, who had been wounded in the last stages of the North African campaign, were angry on discharge from hospital to be told they were not being posted home with their parent units - they would be used as replacements for losses in the new Italian campaign and posted to other units. Nearly a thousand men in this position mutinied and refused to accept orders. When disaffected veterans joined in, the Army had a big problem.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a> most universities had a kind of ROTC attached to them, called "voennaya kafedra" that trained all the male students as the reservist officers. Naturally, being the civilian students who weren't generally expected to serve, they didn't take to their training seriously. So, when they <em>were</em> sometimes called to service (they have the same term as the enlisted draftees, two years, so one of their nicknames was "двухгодичники" "dvukh-goh-deech-ni-ki" - "two-year-ers"), they were the definition of that trope  leading to the other nicknames, such as "Partisans" for the attendees of refreshment courses and "Jackets" for the serving ones.
</li><li> Most police forces. They sometimes have military ranks and follow many military ways, but are supposed to be a civilian force (in Britain and the U.S. they are now called a "service" or "department" instead of a "force" but...). Unfortunately, in the U.S., because of "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">War on Drugs</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>", for the past 25 years or so they have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam">more and more militarized</a> and the training or reforms that can help reduce unintended incidents and outrage is just not there.
</li><li> The Iranian IRGC (or Revolutionary Guard) acts like this. They even take pride in it, their unofficial motto being that their "order is in their lack of order". Military ranks mean little in practice, with common soldiers and high ranking officers interacting casually on daily basis and having people of lower rank serve in "higher" positions compared to those of higher rank isn't that rare (like a Major being the direct commanding officer of a colonel) and their apparent lack of strategy and order used to drive the more disciplined Army crazy during Iran-Iraq war. However, arguably, this is their strength (specially since any conflict they were ever involved in was a guerrilla war or one in which they were heavily out numbered and out gunned). It's next to impossible to break their command structure and conflicting or nonsensical orders that can unhinge most militaries don't effect them since unit commanders (and even common soldiers) are taught when to "disobey a direct order" so they'll just ignore weird orders and do their thing. During the Iran-Iraq war, units caught behind enemy lines, with no means of communication, were as effective as any other unit.
</li><li> The Australians of the Boer War earned a reputation for larrikinism with the British, being incredibly irreverent all around, but especially toward the British officers who were unused to seeing such laid-back and undisciplined behaviour. This characterised the behaviour of Australian troops for much of the following century, with the Australian enthusiasm for 'having fun' with prisoners, people trying to surrender, and enemy civilians earning them a mix of fear and hatred that contrasted sharply with the more ambivalent feelings to the 'restrained' and 'uptight' British. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">'Having fun' didn't mean 'beer and cricket' so much as it did summary execution and sexual assault</a>.
</li><li> This is a common trait with militias and rebel groups of all stripes, composed as they are of non-professional fighters who've often received little training.
<ul><li> This trope was probably true to varying extents for most of military forces throughout history - professional armies of regulars were a rule for a minority of most of humanity's history, with most armies being trained and mobilized (along with mercenaries hired) just on a very as-needed basis with hopefully just enough uniformity to their equipment to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe">avoid friendly fire on the battlefield</a>, and then being demobilized once seen as unneeded.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, some Marine reservists, expecting to not see combat during their tenure, were dumped into battle without the benefit of boot camp. As Lieutenant Joseph R. Owen recalls in his memoir <em>Colder than Hell</em>, this lead to things like soldiers not referring to their officers as 'sir' and loudly muttering about their officers while they're in ear shot.
</li><li> Early on during the Russian Revolution the Red Army attempted this, as the bolsheviks believed notions of rank and discipline were a bourgeois affectation. After repeatedly getting their asses kicked by the more traditionally organized White forces, Trotsky reorganized the force including bringing in former imperial officers to make it a proper military force.
</li><li> Oddly enough, The Wehrmacht. No army in WW2 allowed their soldiers to grow their hair as long (which made German soldiers something of a darling among the ladies, foreign and domestic) but punishments for uniform violations were quite lax and completely took the backseat when the war started going. It also helped that the new Infantry Manual called for self-imposed discipline, self-imposed by the soldier himself for reason of love of his comrades, his country or professionalism, instead of imposing discipline from an outside source.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em>, the actors had to endure strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to get them into character as World War II soldiers. This was something they were required to keep up on set as well. New actors playing replacements did not get this and showed up on set - including a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHardy">Tom Hardy</a> on his first job - with their uniforms on wrong, thoroughly annoying the original actors.
</li><li> The Canadian Military Engineers are particularly known for being <em>very</em> laid back and having rather lax standards for dress and deportment as compared to other members of the Canadian Armed Forces, since their jobs include things like construction equatable to a civilian journeyman, camp maintenance and construction with a heavy emphasis on technical and applicable skills, and working with explosives, mines, and improvised explosive devices. It's also very common for members of the CME to be on a first-name basis unless a suitably high-ranked person is watching. It all tends to get a pass since they're often not in the spotlight and it simply wouldn't be possible to expect these soldiers to have pristine uniforms and boots at all times. There's a very good reason the <em>Salute to the Engineers</em> contains the line "They may look like tramps, but they build your camps, and they sometimes lead the advance": they're for the most part seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny Ears Lawyers</a> who always manage to get their jobs done.
