</p><p>Sometimes, even a villain finds it furthers their aims to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> from time to time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotoOpWithTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotoOpWithTheDog">even if it's just for show</a>. Maybe there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">dog-kicking</a> in their past; even if there isn't, the Pragmatic Villain is the type to have studied those who have. No matter the combination of dogs and boots, and they're sure to have investigated them all quite thoroughly, there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">just isn't anything to be gained by it</a> and one's toes get a little tender after too much of that kind of thing. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">a dog kicked too often can bite back</a>. Though a pragmatic villain is likely to be less destructive than their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> counterpart, they are made all the more dangerous by their focus on their ultimate goals and their reluctance to carry the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Oftentimes, their course of action is determined solely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEvilOverlordTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEvilOverlordTactics">discerning which</a> would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">best serve their purposes</a>. Being evil, to them, just keeps their options open when it comes to illegal and immoral acts, and doesn't stop them from using 'legitimate' (or at least socially respectable) strategies and tactics. Heroes are sometimes surprised when said villains do something "unexpectedly" evil later, when they were doing "good" things before. Should kicking the dog become a necessary step in their master plan, however, expect their kick to have the power and precision of a football player going for a game-winning field goal, usually while stating it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal">Nothing Personal</a>. They will easily cross the finish line in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, but only if it's useful to them.
</p><p>Virtually any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> tends to be a master of this trope. Villains With Good Publicity almost always have years of experience in earning the trust of their supporters, and are well aware that angering dog-lovers (among others) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">will not advance their cause and may hinder it</a>. Even for those who don't happen to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>, if any dog-kicking is deemed necessary, they will keep these acts of cruelty out of the public eye, or when they can't do that, they'll do what they can to make it look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">the victim deserved it</a>; how evil they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">truly are under cover of darkness</a> must remain shrouded in darkness. They also tend to be masters of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> will probably attempt to justify his nobility this way, with varying degrees of believability. Whenever there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">Generic Doomsday Villain</a> or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> around, there's a good chance the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">other villains</a> will form an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with the heroes to stop them, as they want to rule the world, <strong>not</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">destroy it.</a> Or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">not steal their job of fighting the heroes.</a> Even most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> villains who do things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> fall to this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">There's no fun</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction">or challenge</a> for them if everyone's dead — they'd be left forlorn with no idea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">what to do next.</a> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncidentalVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncidentalVillain">Incidental Villain</a> most often excels in this with his worldview generally being that of a Monopoly game where advancing towards their goals through the quickest and most efficient way is the only thing that matters to them and beating the rivals on their way is optional and hardly obligatory much of the time. This mindset is helpful in stories where the bad guys have a huge advantage over their antagonists, leading them to not so much beat them, as much as convince them that it will be more profitable not to commit the crimes that they intended to and instead choose a legit way as an alternative.

For the <em>less</em> evil and more moderate version of this trope, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">Do Wrong, Right</a>, where an evil act is decried for being poorly executed, and in which the standards that the evil act fails to adhere to are not necessarily those held by a Pragmatic Villain: e.g. one villain could invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">Do Wrong, Right</a> on another for lacking flair.
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is extremely rare for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> to invoke this trope, as they are usually unrestrained and do not care if their evil will backfire. In the few examples that do exist, a CM's simplicity is often downplayed by the heinousness of their plans.

Balalaika averts it once when she declares personal war on Hansel and Gretel for killing one of her men, though she also had a pragmatic reason since the pair were destabilizing Roanapur by their presence, and by ruthlessly crushing them she sent the message to Hotel Moscow's enemies that there would be a bloody price extracted for anyone who dared attack her or her men.
</li><li> When Elroy, the man Dutch arranged to finish Gretel's getaway, kills the girl instead, Dutch chews him out for ruining his reputation as a transporter. Elroy admits that he did it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob">One Last Job</a> because his son is sick so he has to get out of the business.
<ul><li> Despite Balalaika desperately wanting Hansel and Gretel dead for killing her subordinate, she doesn't go after the Lagoon Trading Company for ferrying Gretel out of the city. Though not explicitly stated, it's implied she spared them because they've proven too useful to kill over a single act against her.
</li></ul></li><li> Dutch also says in the manga that he doesnt want to risk himself in an operation that could make him a lot of money, (dooming himself to work for significantly less money that other operators) because he knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob">doing the job is a great way to get himself killed</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, Sigurd threatens to kill Kirito when the latter intercedes in a dispute between Sigurd and Leafa. Since Kirito is in an enemy capital city, he can't fight back, but Sigurd stops when one of his underlings points out that there are people watching, and it would look bad if he killed Kirito. Apparently believing that taking his anger out on Kirito wouldn't be worth the blow to his reputation, Sigurd lets Kirito go.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!</a></em>, several students falsely accuse Catarina of bullying Maria (which she was guilty of in the original game, but not in the anime). However, Catarina's friends stand up for her and disprove the accusations. Some time later, Geordo and Catarina realize that the students would normally never even attempt make false accusations against Catarina, since as the daughter of a duke, she outranks her accusers. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the students had fallen under the sway of a dark magic user</span>.
</li><li> Quincy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> and owner of Genom in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> has absolutely no issue with ordering the deaths of individuals if it benefits his company and power. However, Quincy's not a villain for villainy's sake and is content with the power he does have. To that end, he's more than willing to deal with public protests and lawsuits if the other option is handing over control of the particle beam satellite to a terrorist who'd only use it to kill as many people as he wants. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Largo hijacks control of the satellite and uses it to destroy various Genom buildings across the Earth, killing hundreds of thousands in the process, Quincy's genuinely horrified by not only the loss of property but loss of life in general. Even his assistant Kate Madigan's horrified, and she just killed a man moments before because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">he outlived his usefulness</a>.</span>

<ul><li> Crime Boss Wallenquist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> refuses to seek revenge on Wallace, who almost singlehandedly dismantled his human slavery market, because there's no benefit to him.
<div class="indent">"Revenge is a loser's game. There's no percentage in it. All that matters is profit and power."
</div><ul><li> In "The Big Fat Kill", Dwight appears to know this about Wallenquist, and is counting on it. He makes a point of killing all of the men Wallenquist has sent so he'll conclude that fighting Old Town is more trouble than it's worth. The idea of escalation never seems to come up.
</li></ul></li><li> The Shocker, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s enemies, is almost unique among the wall-crawler's enemies in that he's rarely concerned with taking revenge on our hero and prefers to only commit crimes that are actually profitable. Of course, superhero comics being what they are, Spider-Man is almost always the one to interfere with the Shocker's robberies. He also avoids doing anything above robberies as he believes doing anything beyond that will simply attract the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>.
<ul><li> Speaking of the Punisher: after Eddie Brock's reformation as Anti-Venom, Castle refuses to forgive him for his earlier crimes as Venom, and repeatedly tries to kill him. At one point, after witnessing Brock save several women's lives from a drug warlord, the Punisher has a clear headshot of Brock in his sights, but then gets up without taking the shot. After a friend questions whether he changed his mind and considered Brock morally redeemed, Castle reveals he was actually just out of bullets.
</li><li> The Hobgoblin started out with this, vowing to avoid the Green Goblin's mistakes and only went to kill Spider-Man to make sure he wouldn't mess with his plans. However, these traits were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">lost</a>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">the character's backstory is complicated</a>, with there having been multiple Hobgoblins. The original Hobgoblin still has profit as his biggest motivator, and is actually willing to let other villains use his gimmick, provided they pay him a cut and aren't too embarrassing to him.
</li><li> Another Spider-Man example; after escaping from Ravencroft, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> assaulted Martha Robinson and then wrote his catchphrase "Carnage Rules" using her blood <em>and</em> his next to her on an elevator wall, but did <em>not</em> kill her, because he felt that a live, injured, and frightened victim would cause more panic among the <em>Daily Bugle</em> staff than a corpse would. (And it certainly did.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan">The Superior Foes of Spider-Man</a></em>, Tombstone was disappointed that his daughter Janice wished to become a costumed supervillain rather than be a mob lawyer since he felt the latter was more profitable and in his eyes equivalent to legalized crime. Nonetheless, he didn't stop her, but told her that she had to support herself if she wished to pursue supervillainy.
</li></ul></li><li> Bullseye may be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a>, but during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a></em>, he was lucid enough to realize that he was working for someone who was out of his gourd when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> planned to attack Asgard. (And he wasn't the only villain working for Osborn who thought so.)
</li><li> He needed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> to point it out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Vol 2</a>, but no, Ares does not support nuclear and biological war - he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">needs war in order to live</a>. A nuclear war would give Ares a short-term major power boost, but with no one left to fight wars he would eventually fade into nothing. Smaller scale wars that can constantly feed him are more practical for long term survival.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> is like this a lot:
<ul><li> He will never try to conquer the universe through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> on the grounds that it is far too reckless. There are simply far too many things that could go wrong when you alter history.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Also the reason he teamed up with the heroes</a> to take down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Anti-Monitor.</a> It wasn't out of the goodness of his heart, but if anyone was going to destroy and conquer the universe, it's going to be him.
</li><li> He objects to Desaad and Sleez's acts of evil because they are largely pointless. Desaad is a petty sadist. Sleez once mind-controlled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, but instead of doing anything useful with him like trying to conquer the world, he made Superman <em>star in a porno</em>.
</li><li> Another example occurred in <em>Cosmic Odyssey</em> (not surprising, since <em>Odyssey</em> had basically the same plot as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>), in which it was Darkseid, of all people, who organized the heroes to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Anti-Life Entity</a>. Of course, Darkseid did try to manipulate the situation to his own advantage, fully in keeping with this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Christu Bulat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherMAX">The Punisher MAX</a></em> arc "The Slavers", in total contrast to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">father</a>. The relationship between the two is rather strained because Christu views human trafficking as a business and raping girls as just part of the business. He also berates his father for using his bare hands instead of a gun to kill a gang member, as well as for shooting the whole gang. As you could guess from his profession, though, he's still a heartless, raping bastard. His pragmatism is best demonstrated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his willingness to kill his own father. It doesn't work out, both because he underestimated his father and because he gets disemboweled</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> universe, after the "costumed hero" phase hit its peak, most costumed villains started either reforming entirely or switching to "less showy" pursuits like drug dealing and prostitution rackets.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> explained that he doesn't place Joker Venom on post office stamps because it was too ludicrous a crime even for him, preferring instead to operate on a much smarter level in regards to such matters. This was also when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">he was framed for placing Joker Venom on postage stamps and nearly executed as a result</a>.
<ul><li> He himself also invokes the trope, whenever the bad guys do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a>, they RARELY (If ever) invite the Joker in. While most of them were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">genuinely afraid of him</a>, some of them didn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">he's not exactly a team player</a> and is considered unprofessional and untrustworthy even from his fellow villains. The exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>, who does invite him if he's in charge of the villain team ups on the basis that it's safer to have an unpredictable Joker on your team than it is to have an unpredictable Joker who's offended you snubbed him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManAndBatmanDisorderedMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManAndBatmanDisorderedMinds">One time</a>, he begged off from doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamup">Villain Teamup</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> because Carnage just wanted to maim and kill, while Joker preferred <em>panache</em> in his murders.
<div class="indent"><strong>The Joker:</strong> I always thought of myself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> of crime and chaos, while you, apparently, aspire to be nothing more than... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHasselhoff">David Hasselhoff</a>!
</div></li><li> The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePenguin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePenguin">The Penguin</a> is perfectly sane may have contributed to his mutation into a gray market white-collar criminal who Batman is grudgingly willing to tolerate as a source of information on the criminal underworld.
<ul><li> In one issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a> where Damien briefly gets superpowers and corners a group of top level villains, Penguin panickedly yells at everyone to stand down.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> is pretty much the one person in Batman's rogues gallery who has never wanted to play games or complex schemes as she's simply a thief. It was best summed up in a storyline set on Earth-2 where Batman recruits Catwoman to help him against the Scarecrow. They find themselves playing a complex game as Scarecrow wants to break Batman down before killing him with various clues left to find him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Catwoman</strong>: He must be crazy. All I ever wanted to do was get away from you long enough to enjoy the loot!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Batman</strong>: I know. After psychopaths like Joker, Two-Face and Riddler, you have no idea how refreshing it was to fight someone who was just in it for the money.

</div></li><li> You're Dracula. The series is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RequiemVampireKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RequiemVampireKnight">Requiem Vampire Knight</a></em>. Six million lemures, the souls of those who were mistreated and murdered in life and can only be stopped by killing their tormentor in death, are swarming your ship. Do you fight them all one on one? Or do you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">step into your back room and break Hitler's neck, wiping out all six million in a stroke?</span>
<ul><li> Also in this same comic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Black Sabbat</a> stops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Atilla the Hun</a> from murdering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Requiem</a> for the heinous crime of being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad">kind and honorable</a></em> (which by Hell standards, its considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">quite objectionable</a>) by pointing out they need every available vampire knight to fight their wars and they can't afford to waste their forces. Of course, Sabbat has ulterior plans for Requiem too so that is why he had him spared.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> may indulge in petty wasteful sadistic villainy often, but he does not appreciate anyone on his payroll doing the same. Villainy committed on his dime has to have <em>some</em> kind of profit for him.
<ul><li> One comic showed him foiling a plan by Madam Hydra, his subordinate at the time, that wanted to blind every American who was watching a television set at some point. He said he was called a lot of things, but never a Nihilist anarchist.
<ul><li> Hilariously, he once renounced Nazism to embrace... nihilist anarchism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">It didn't take.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers">His clone</a> takes this to another level — while still an unrepentant racist, he's started recruiting from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">both sexes and all races</a>, in order to gather enough people who hate mutants as much as he does.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>'s Rogues tend towards this, especially Captain Cold; it is one of their unspoken rules <em>not</em> to kill speedsters, since they <em>know</em> that the other superheroes <em>will</em> hunt them down, <em>will not stop</em>, and may even be "<em>creative</em>" about retribution... for example, what Wally "The Flash" West <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">did to Inertia</a> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">de-powering Wally's cousin Bart Allen, also aka The Flash, which led to his death when the Rogues panicked and unwittingly killed him</span>. They promptly turned on Inertia for that, meaning that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iris told Wally that Inertia was the "<em>prime mover</em>" in Bart's death</span>, but still ended up on the run for a year; <em>Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge</em> was about them deciding to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">first hang up the spandex and disband, but then upon hearing of Inertia's escape, they decide to do their one last job and kill Inertia in revenge. Upon succeeding, they dump his corpse in Keystone City with a message to "<em>Tell the Flash we're even - The Rogues</em>."</span>
<ul><li> Also, when Libra tries to get the Rogues to join, Captain Cold's refusal explicitly taunts him: "<em>Have fun with the heat comin' your way for takin' out the Martian</em>." That, and as Captain Cold pointed out in <em>Rogues Revenge: #1</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were <em>persona non grata</em> among supervillains in the year after they'd killed a Flash, so Captain Cold isn't inclined to back them either</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em>, most career villains (including mooks) avoid killing heroes unless absolutely necessary, particularly the weak, useless ones like Empowered — doing so will result in your victim's hero friend tracking you down to exact bloody vengeance instead of just arresting you.
</li><li> This sometimes applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">low-level criminals and petty thugs</a> in some of the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> as well. In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> comic, for instance, two perverts in the showers at the local YMCA are planning to rape Bruce Banner until he warns them about his having super powers; they decide not to see whether he's bluffing. Moreover, in the future depicted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a>'s comics, several bands of assassins made it a policy only to subdue cops who got in their way and never to kill them, since the various law enforcement agencies involved tend to retaliate swiftly and brutally against cop-killers. A couple of petty burglars caught in the act by a superhero also surrender immediately rather than risk the near-certainty of being pounded into the pavement for fighting or fleeing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a> is a criminal who mainly steals from other criminals, but it's not because he hates them, it's because they tend to keep their money and jewels in their homes and banks have become too much even for him.
<div class="indent">"My dear Eva, illicit business pays well, and what really matters is that it's done in cash. I'm sure that home is full of money."
</div></li><li> Many criminals appearing in Paperinik's stories, both in the normal stories and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> Petty criminals caught by Paperinik in the act will surrender, because whatever they do they'll get arrested and if they try and resist or escape they'll just get beat up;
</li><li> In <em>Paperinik New Adventures</em>, the Evronians are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eaters</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">invade any planet on their way to drain their inhabitants of all emotions</a> with a process that will transform them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks">Coolflames</a>. They won't drain <em>all</em> inhabitants, however, as some could be useful at a later date and they still need a breeding population to feed themselves. They also spare significant energy sources as they're approaching an energetic crisis, and are desperately searching an infinite one specifically to avert it.
<ul><li> In the reboot, Gorthan reacts to finding out that Coolflamization can be reversed by <em>not</em> destroying Earth, as humans are particularly rich in emotions and raiding them continuously to drain them will be more profitable in the long run. In a possible future they do so for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">one thousand years</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Also from <em>Paperinik New Adventures</em>, the Organization, who provide multiple examples:
<ul><li> They are time pirates who aim at changing history in such a way they'll be in command of the world, but their attempts at doing it (or at least the one seen in the series) involve assembling a device to move history on their preferred course because they're smart enough to know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButterflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButterflyEffect">it could easily backfire</a>;
</li><li> In one occasion they help Paperinik <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">stopping the creation of a bubble that would otherwise erase time itself</a> because it would destroy everything they want to steal;
</li><li> When they decide to get rid of Paperinik, they send their agent to act <em>after</em> the defeat of the Evronians, as they knew his role into the event and that otherwise the Evronians would have become unstoppable and invaded Earth. They also only do it because Paperinik was becoming too much of a danger for them;
</li><li> When they <em>accidentally</em> end up ruling the world as an unintended consequence of their apparent success in killing Paperinik, the future they rule over doesn't seem any different from what is seen in other occasions, presumably because otherwise there would be too many rebellions;
</li><li> Their main agent the Raider once showed up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> prevent Duckburg from getting destroying in a nuclear fusion experiment going awry</span>. It's not out of the goodness of his heart, but because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the nuclear experiment working</span> would be the only possible power source for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Othership</a> that isn't too surveilled. In fact, had he not needed to charge the Othership he would have left the events proceeding as normal because he isn't stupid enough to risk running afoul of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButterflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButterflyEffect">The Butterfly Effect</a>;
</li><li> In his final appearance in the first series, the Raider <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> betrays the Organization to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice">Time Police</a></span> because, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with time travel stopping working</span>, it was time to retire, and the Time Police paid well.

However, he's doing his best to get the public on his side, and the big reveal at the end of the series is that he wasn't behind the murders and malfunctions in the city because simply put: dead citizens and faulty maintenance reflect badly on him, so why would he go out of the way to sabotage the heroes if it meant him looking bad? This carries over into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars">The Transformers: Combiner Wars</a></em> where writer Mairghread Scott describes his character in one quote:

Just how evil she is is a matter for some debate. Certainly she's a multiple murderess who shows no remorse about her crimes, and she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">made into a villainess</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> without any significant changes to her personality or methods.

But in any case, when she joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a>, she did agree to stop killing people, not because she thought it was wrong, but because the other Birds would not work with her otherwise. Of course, the reason she wanted to be a part of the Birds in the first place was because she valued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">the friendship of Black Canary so much</a>. So is Huntress a pragmatic villainess who restrains her murderous impulses because she knows her teammates won't work with her otherwise, or is she a killer who has been at least partly redeemed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship">Power of Friendship</a>?

At the end of the story it is revealed that as Vader was distracted, Fett aimed his gun at him for a kill shot before thinking the better of it and fleeing. As he puts it, by then there was no reason to fight further, and killing Vader would only make him the most wanted man in the Empire. He also recognizes this trait in Vader himself, noting that "the Dark Lord is not one to make fruitless enemies.

</li><li> Indeed, every faction in <em>40k</em> are pragmatic villains; Dan Abnett pointed out that if Chaos really <em>was</em> a "nail a baby to your helmet" society as some claim they would simply collapse in on themselves and be destroyed within a week. As such, even the most villainous <em>40k</em> factions must, by definition, have a functioning society. Since they can all threaten the Imperium to a greater or lesser degree, that means there must be people who <em>can</em> engage in pragmatic villainy. Any examples (from any race) that contradicts this can therefore be dismissed on the grounds of "every sufficiently large organisation has a bloody twit in a position of power."
<ul><li> Speaking of Chaos, the Alpha Legion have this as their hat. Most other traitor legions treat their cultists and mortal servants with disdain and just hand them a rifle or melee weapon (<em>if that</em>) and throw them at the enemy. The Alpha Legion recognise that their few astartes can't be everywhere at once and are difficult to replace, so if mortal servants can be trained to be guerilla fighters and agents then that helps protect their lives even more than simply using them as bullet-catchers.

Individual vampires will even treat themselves as expendable, because they can often just be brought back to life no matter what happens to them (cannonball takes their head off, get trampled under knights, take a magic sword through the chest, whatever) through magical means or just by absorbing enough life force and coming back through the dust they were reduced to. What vampires <em>won't</em> do is needlessly expend the lives of their mortal servants: why send a loyal dreg to his death and embolden the living against the Midnight Aristocracy, when you can simply raise a dead enemy and send him to kill his living friends? Few living beings will willingly associate with the undead, and unlike the undead they can operate in plain sight (and daylight!), so vampire lords can't just waste them.

<ul><li> Since Shadowrunners are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">freelance criminals</a>, the more successful crews subscribe to this ideology. Basically, be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a>: don't destroy stuff you aren't being paid to destroy, don't kill anybody you aren't being paid to kill, and don't get caught by the news.
</li><li> Most megas you steal from tend to follow the same 'code': Shadowrunning is simply a cost of doing business. Runners who can avoid or escape internal security and the police response without leaving the corps with a big pile of death benefits and property damage or an irreplaceable loss of prestige may not be worth sending a kill team after. On the other hand, if the price of hiring assassins becomes just another decimal point to the losses you've already caused them, the insurance that you won't be troubling them again becomes very tempting indeed.
<ul><li> However, there are exceptions to this. Reveal Aztechnology blood rituals or steal a set of the Renraku Red Samurai's signature armor and they might just call down a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> on you. Meanwhile, Mitsuhama makes it a matter of company policy to take <em>all</em> shadowruns against them personally. Conversely, runners do not care so much about collateral damage when running against Mitsuhama.

It advises this not because being pragmatic is more moral, but because it tends to ensure long-term survival.
</li><li> Dark General Cobalt of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SailorNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SailorNothing">Sailor Nothing</a></em> is this in contrast to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> acquaintances. It's not that he has a moral objection to rape, torture, and murder, it's just that he finds it a colossal waste of time. He'd much rather focus on getting things done. Interestingly, his pragmatism actually results in his being the villain the heroes encounter the <em>most</em>—in the interests of actually getting his project off the ground, he decides to kill the girls who've been wiping out his underlings.
</li><li> Quite a few characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em> have shades of this.

(He <em>is</em> on the record as the sort of villain that can confidently take on entire teams and expect to win.) Instead he's quite content to fight a bunch of opponents for a while to acquire their powers, then use those while they last to pull off his <em>real</em> scheme, and then do a vanishing act to enjoy his ill-gotten gains; that approach has been working well for him for <em>years</em> by now and as far as he's concerned he has no reason to change it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>:
<ul><li> Coil, who wants to take over a city, is this. His stated goals include an involved plan to reduce unemployment via a massive reconstruction effort, reduction in drug-dealing to less harmful drugs, and no more hate crimes in the streets by superpowered Neo-Nazis. As he states, this is because his pride simply couldn't bear it if something that he owned didn't function at the absolute best levels.
</li><li> The protagonist herself is one of the best examples of the crossover between this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>; Her fundamental goal is safety for herself and whomever she considers "her people", to the extent that she originally planned to be a hero. In the end, she tends to come down on the side of murder and mayhem because it seems to be the most pragmatic means to those ends, and her 'virtue' is almost always a matter of stopping because she's already won, not doing something because it would be counterproductive in the long run, or doing something 'good' because she and her gang benefit overall. Even her power and its uses are focused primarily around logistics more than anything else.
</li><li> More generally, the greater majority of villains in <em>Worm</em> are pragmatic in their villainy, as those who publicly commit sufficiently heinous crimes are marked by the Parahuman Response Team with a "kill order" and find themselves hunted by successively larger and more powerful groups of unpowered and superpowered individuals. In particular, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaking the Endbringer truce</span> or targeting another cape's family are likely to cause your opponents to pull out all the stops in an effort to kill you.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cinder berates her minions Emerald and Mercury for murdering a White Fang terrorist defector without orders. This isn't because she opposed the killing itself, as she'd already ordered Roman Torchwick, a local known criminal, to kill the defector in the first place. Rather, she's pissed because her plan requires herself, Emerald, and Mercury to remain unnoticed while they infiltrate Beacon Academy and the killing would draw unnecessary attention to them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Ruby permanently maims Cinder during the Battle of Beacon, Cinder prioritises <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">seeking revenge above all else</a>. In Volume 5, she violates Salem's orders and sacrifices all pragmatism due to her obsession with Ruby.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Salem</a> doesn't engage in blood-thirsty, murderous behaviour, even though she possesses the power and ability to take whatever she wants by force. While Hazel honours this by chastising the White Fang leaders for their violence instead of minimising unnecessary killing, Cinder directly questions Salem's attitude. Salem explains that Cinder must never underestimate the usefulness of others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She cites the example of Professor Lionheart, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Professor Ozpin's</a> oldest allies, whom she turned against Ozpin because he controlled the access to the Relic of Knowledge hidden inside Haven's vault. However, once the plan to obtain the Relic fails, Salem has no further use for Leo and has him murdered without hesitation.</span>
</li><li> Dr. Watts knows to prioritize an end-goal above all else. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Salem</a> demands that her subordinates retrieve the Spring Maiden so that they can obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower">Relic of Knowledge</a> from Haven Academy's vault without humanity ever knowing it happened, Watts has no tolerance for any plan that endangers the secrecy and simplicity of the original plan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Spring Maiden lives with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanditClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanditClan">Bandit Clan</a> that is commanded by Raven Branwen, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">former ally</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Ozpin's</a>. By threatening the clan's existence, they force Raven to work with them to retrieve the Relic of Knowledge. However, Raven decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and tries to turn Salem's forces against Ozpin's forces by insisting that she'll only give them the Spring Maiden if they kill Qrow, her brother and Ozpin's most loyal ally. Although Watts acknowledges the value for Salem's side in killing off Qrow, he refuses to agree to Qrow's death because it'll turn a secret, simple infiltration into a full-blown and very public brawl. However, Cinder agrees because it gives her the chance to seek revenge against Ruby. Unable to change Cinder's mind, Watts refuses to have anything to do with the revised plan and returns home to Salem.</span>
</li><li> Jacques Schnee, head of the Schnee Dust Company, is a ruthless businessman and who regularly abuses his family. Volume 7 has him running for a seat on Atlas' council to end the closed borders and dust embargo that Ironwood has set up, which are cutting into his profits. He mentions that if he wasn't counting on their votes, he'd lay off most of his employees to save money. When Dr. Watts offers to rig the computerized votes in Jacques' favor, Jacques eagerly goes through with the layoffs, figuring he can have his cake and eat it.
</li></ul></li><li> While Reeve of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/FinalFantasyVIIMachinabridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/FinalFantasyVIIMachinabridged">Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> of Shinra, he knows that trying to appeal to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">colleagues'</a> morality is a pointless endeavour, so he tries to appeal to their business sense when yelling at them for dropping a section of the city onto another section of the city, killing thousands in an effort to quash a rebel cell that consisted of six people. This fails as well.
