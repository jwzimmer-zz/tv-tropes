</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and actual history, it is certainly true that historical accounts can be subject to the personal bias of the writer and readers have to be wary of them, which is what the saying warns us about. However, applying the saying in such a simplistic manner can potentially be as reductive, misleading, and more importantly just as binary as "the winners' narrative". To say that history is written by the winners <em>should</em> mean that we should treat both the winners and losers fairly and not present a one-sided view. Academic historians would qualify this by stating that our knowledge about our past, certain figures and events, is based only on a few sources and furthermore, our understanding of history is never static and unchanging. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">History is, in truth, written and rewritten by all sorts of people with different agendas</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography">Historiography<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a separate discipline that actually studies and keeps track of how people's opinions about the past and certain events change throughout history. The reason for those changes is that people who win in one era, would lose in the other and their conquerors will be as generous to the defeated as they were to their defeated. Likewise, "winners" and "losers" mean a variety of things. In the military-political sense, <em>losers</em> at times do end up writing history; since they've often been deprived of actual power after their defeat, they often spend their time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillFightingTheCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillFightingTheCivilWar">sulking and writing about how things would have been so much better had they won</a> - just ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">a Neo-Nazi</a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy">a Confederate apologist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The "real" actual and potential losers in this situation would be in the racial-economical sense, (African-Americans, Jews, LGBT and other minorities).

Many of history's "winners" will be surprisingly honest about atrocities or even write proudly of how they brutally crushed their opponents, because it would serve their self-interest and their careerist aspirations. For example, Caesar wrote of his borderline genocide of the Gauls in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CommentariesOnTheGallicWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CommentariesOnTheGallicWar">his personal memoirs</a>, and historians doubt that account and other Roman accounts only because they feel Caesar is exaggerating, not only his actions but also those of his enemies, since Romans always did like painting its wars as "defensive" and their victories as underdog triumphs, so historians are skeptical about the moments when Romans invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> on their enemies as well. It likewise appealed to the vanity and pride of an Empire to preserve trophies and symbols of their conquest of foreign peoples, after all if the winner is writing a history, they would need losers to make themselves and their achievements look special. You can't be a King without a Kingdom and a People to rule over, so in every work of propaganda there are, for lack of a better term, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianSlip">Freudian Slip</a> and other bits and moments that actually do allow the multitude to peep over the shoulder of their rulers. It's also worth pointing out the most obvious fact that even people <em>on the same side</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">will often disagree wildly on events and motivations</a>.

After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters</a>.
</p><p>Note that if the historical dispute already exists its use may become controversial at worst, or people may feel there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a> at best. And if it doesn't, people may not take it seriously, and think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Beethoven Was an Alien Spy</a> is at play instead (disputing historical accounts is the task of historians, not authors of works of fiction). The usual way to deal with this is to apply the trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction">completely fictional history</a>, where both the official and disputed events are fictional to begin with. Such as the exploits of the national hero of a fictional country, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpireWithADarkSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpireWithADarkSecret">Empire with a Dark Secret</a>. The usual way is to provide a recap of the official history, have the hero find out the real and darker history, and start a conflict between him and the figures in power that may be in problem if the actual history comes to light. There are three possible outcomes. One, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> and official history stays. Two, the actual history comes to light, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>. Third, the hero realizes the scope of the changes that would take place and decides that it's not worth it; for good or evil, history has already happened a long time ago, and its discussion should be merely academic.

The World Government absolutely forbids any research into the century immediately prior to their founding. They will murder anyone and raze entire islands to keep that secret. The only record of that time is found on indestructible tablets called Poneglyphs, written in a dead language that only one living person knows how to read. Others could before, and the government had them systematically killed.

The truth is, Orochi teamed up with and basically gave Wano to the Beasts Pirates who slew the rightful Lord Oden (The next shogun) in a bloody invasion and the country outside the capital is dying because of the pirates' factories.

Then Zeus defeated her in battle and took over as ruler. He rewrote history and the myths so that her true role was forgotten and she was demoted to being one of his daughters. This is the underlying principle of all Divine Ancestors. Earth goddesses defeated by warrior gods have their power stolen and memories sealed, rendering them obedient daughters or wives of the victor.

</li><li> Evoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsAdvocate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsAdvocate">The Devil's Advocate</a></em>: Kevin Lomax tells John Milton that Satan and his progeny lost in the Bible, and they're destined to lose again at the end of time. Milton retorts that <em>of course</em> the Bible would say that, considering who it's written by. The ironic part is that the Bible has very little to say about Satan and "the Heavenly argument", and in earlier Jewish tradition, he was even considered an ally of God. Much of the Satanic role came from later traditions of Christianity and was informed by the poet John Milton's "Paradise Lost", who was famously called "of the devil's party without knowing it".

Aegon had Rhaenyra eaten by his dragon <em>in front of her son</em>, as well as having one of his supporters murder Rhaenyra's son for seeking support with the Baratheons. in retaliation, Rhaenyra had two men sneak into the Red Keep and force a mother to choose which of her children she wanted dead, and then proceed to murder <em>the other one</em>, so the living child would spend the rest of his life knowing his mother wanted him dead.

Given that G'Kar's father was hung from a tree by his thumbs until he died <em>three days later</em> (for the crime of <em>accidentally spilling a cup of tea on a Centauri woman</em>), it renders the Centauri account a bit questionable.

According to the revised version, they came in peace and freely offered the advantages of their more advanced technology. However, the humans resisted and the Tsal-Khan won the long and bitter war that followed, which resulted in the plants being poisoned.

<ul><li> Virtually every religious text will describe the founder of their religion as an impossibly perfect and good human being. They're all basically hagiographies in which you're never able to check how much of it is true or how much less heroic stuff has been left out. This goes so far that some theologians in fact apply a "rule of embarrassment" to find out which things are likely to have happened. A tale of Jesus being wrong would have no place in a hagiography and hence some theologians argue that it only found its way into a story written by a Christian because it actually happened. Example: the time he got mad and cursed a fig tree for not having fruit, only for his followers to point out it wasn't in season.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood">Satan is Good</a> beliefs held this about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, which would make some sense if only because the modern idea of Satan and the role of the Devil is more or less medieval traditions, fused with left-over paganism and is not really part of classical Judaism.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">Hijacked by Jesus</a> is this trope for some scholars who note that a lot of pagan myths and beliefs, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, were written down after most of its original practitioners and faithful were converted and unlike Greek, Roman and Hindu myths we don't have works written by the people who believed in it.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, where it is established that Chronos ruled over a Golden Age, so the Olympians didn't bother to hide that.

<ul><li> A theory is that this is why Jezebel and her family got such a negative portrayal. All of them were killed off, so nobody was around to tell their side of the story. Their opponents (who had won in the battle of faiths) were thus able to slander them as much as they wanted to.
</li><li> And as for their kingdom in general: around 720 BC, Israel was overrun by the Assyrians, while Judah was saved by a timely civil war that shortly thereafter broke out in the Assyrian Empire and continued to exist for a good 200 additional years. So all somewhat contemporary surviving records of that time come from the priesthood in Jerusalem, which explains why the inhabitants and kings especially of the northern kingdom are described in such a negative light.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> novels reveal that while the Thousand Sons were using sorcery, they were trying to <em>warn</em> the Emperor about the imminent rebellion, but then the true traitor, Warmaster Horus, changed the Space Wolves' orders from "bring in for questioning" to "kill them all," and the psyker-hating Space Wolves were happy to oblige. Nowadays the idea that the Space Wolves were played or that the Emperor should have believed the Thousand Sons' warning are treated as heresy.

Meanwhile, there's hints that the Dark Angels' primarch may have been sitting out the civil war altogether, and the "Fallen" were merely defending themselves against their possibly traitorous kin...

<ul><li> The same applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>, which was written to please King James I, a direct descendant of Duncan, Malcolm, and possibly Banquo.

The Valkyria are still worshiped as gods and saviors, and the Darcsen are prosecuted and marginalized. In truth, the Darcsen were peaceful, and the Valkyria were invaders who enslaved them - as well as causing enormous destruction with their ragnite weapons. They rewrote history to suit themselves, and hid the truth from all but their own descendants.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>: Discussed. At the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Dalish Camp</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Warden</a> can walk in on a Dalish storyteller recounting the history of his people, and how they were conquered and basically enslaved by Andrastian humans for refusing to convert to the worship of the human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Maker</a>. If a non-Dalish Warden points out that the Chantry says that the elves weren't so innocent either (kidnapped human children for human sacrifice blood magic rituals, attacked the helpless human village of Red Crossing, etc), he'll counter that history is written by the winners, and since humans won that war of course they'll demonize the elves to justify what they did to them afterwards (invaded, conquered, and stole their homeland; forced their people to convert or hide out in the woods; kept those who did convert as second-class citizens, etc).
<ul><li> A sidequest in <em>Inquisition</em> reveals the true history of what happened at Red Crossing. It's a <em>lot</em> more complicated, but basically a misunderstanding and a tragic romance became a mutual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">Pretext for War</a> while all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">reasonable leaders</a> from both sides (both of which were later substantially misrepresented in history) were busy getting killed stopping completely unrelated disasters.
</li><li> <em>Inquisition</em> gets even <em>deeper</em> into this with the history of the Ancient Elves, a.k.a. Elvhen. Both the present-day Elves and the Tevinter Imperium would have you believe that the Elvhen empire of Arlathan was destroyed by the Imperium and its survivors enslaved; the <em>actual</em> story is that the Elvhen were not destroyed by invasion, but by internal strife and being separated from the source of their magical powers, causing Arlathan to both literally and metaphorically crumble under its own weight, and the Tevinters just happened to be in the neighborhood to pick through the rubble left behind. So really, history wasn't written by the <em>victors</em> in this case, but by the opportunists who happened upon what was left and claimed it for themselves.

Together, they defeated the Demon King; Morva was even the one to land the killing blow. However, as centuries passed, the human nations which the heroes founded eventually forgot about Morva.

In the years that followed, the Dwemer would be demonized by the Dunmer and popularized by ahistorical tales like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Marobar Sul's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel">Ancient Tales of the Dwemer</a></em> series. Not helping matters is that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">language</a> was quickly lost after their disappearance, making it impossible for anyone to read the Dwemer's own records. (A means of translation was discovered around the time of <em>Morrowind</em>, but was apparently lost again by the time of <em>Skyrim</em> 200 years later.)
</li><li> Also from the backstory, the Ayleids (Wild Elves) are the "losers" to the Alessian Empire "winners". While there is plenty of evidence that the Ayleids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">committed atrocities</a> against their human slaves, there has almost certainly been some exaggeration of the centuries since. Even though several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">rebel Ayleid lords</a> supported Alessia during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">revolt</a> and were permitted to keep their lands and culture after the war, even they would be demonized once the monkey prophet Marukh came to power and founded the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Alessian Order</a>. In addition to the persecution of any elves within the empire, the Order also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">destroyed any records and cultural artifacts</a> of the Ayleids that could be found. Eventually, only the (almost certainly heavily biased) Imperial records of the Alessian Revolt remained.
</li><li> In another backstory example, The ancient Falmer (Snow Elves) were nearly exterminated in a war with Ysgramor and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">500 Companions</a> from Atmora. As part of destroying all traces of the Falmer culture in Skyrim that he could find, Ysgramor also destroyed any evidence of anything that happened other than what <em>his</em> official histories record. For instance, he claims that the Falmer attack on Saarthal was "unprovoked". However, surviving records of the Elves claim that the attack was in response to repeated "provocations and blasphemies" committed by the early Nords.
</li><li> Additionally, the Septim Empire would later play up the relationship between Alessia's Nedic people (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">ancestors</a> of most of the modern races of Men) and the Nords, whose support <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Tiber Septim</a> badly needed to forge his empire. The Nedes were extinct as a unique race centuries before Septim's rise to power.
</li><li> Speaking of Tiber Septim, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade">Imperial orthodox history</a> of his life covers up, denies, or suppresses any other stories of Septim as "heretical". Given that there is plenty of evidence that Septim's life was <em>not</em> the truly noble, humble, and heroic version detailed by the official histories, there is <em>plenty</em> to cover up.
</li><li> Between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a> took credit for ending the Oblivion Crisis which brought them great support in their homeland. They assassinated Potentate Ocato 10 years later, irreparably destabilizing the Third Cyrodiilic Empire. Under their leadership, the Altmer quickly seceded and annexed Valenwood in order to reform the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Dominion</a> of old (and to give them a buffer state between their homeland and Cyrodiil). They then took credit for resolving a crisis with the moons that brought them Elsweyr, homeland of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiit</a>, as a client state.

On one hand, the Norse gods portray the Jötnar as the evil monsters that their native mythology uses them as. The Jötnar, meanwhile, make themselves out to be poor innocent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">woobies</a> that were unfairly persecuted by the Aesir. Both sides come off as if theyre demonizing the other side to justify their warring. Further, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ending heavily implies that Kratos and Atreus/Loki will be presented in propaganda as monstrous villains by Asgard in retaliation for them killing Baldur.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> it's revealed that the origins of the conflict between the Quarians and the Geth was an example of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The winners in this case were the Quarians who killed off Quarians who fought to <em>protect</em> the Geth from being destroyed when they showed signs of sentience. The Geth originally didn't want to fight Quarians even as they were being destroyed — they only started taking up arms in an attempt to protect their friends.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> lore, the Gurubashi War occurred when settlers from Stormwind increasingly encroached on the ancestral lands of the jungle trolls resulting in a series of escalating retaliatory raids. Prince Llane and his friends assassinated the Gurubashi leader in an attempt to stop the raids only for the enraged trolls to send a massive retaliatory army. After the trolls were defeated, at great cost, Llane became king and hid knowledge of the assassination, instead letting the people believe this was a war of one-sided aggression.

The film has the Native Americans thanking Columbus for his role in taking down an evil overlord and the film ends on a happy note. The film, written by and featuring white people, doesn't even mention what a bad turn the future is about to take for the Natives, instead acting like because Columbus "discovered" the continent, it would turn into a great and prosperous civilisation. Nostalgia Critic parodies it with a joke teaser for a sequel, saying that it would feature "lots and lots of slaughtering! Don't look for a G rating on the next one - it's gonna be a bloodbath!" while showing historical images of Europeans slaughtering Native Americans.

During the class's history lesson, the teacher quizzes the students on how Fire Lord Sozin defeated the "Air Nation Army". Of course, Aang (and the viewers) know full well that the Air Nomads were a mostly peaceful population of monks, who didn't even have an established <em>government</em>, much less an army, and that Sozin's attack against them wasn't so much a battle as it was <em>outright genocide</em>. When Aang tries to point this out, the teacher snaps that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">unless he was actually around 100 years ago</a>, he shouldn't be questioning the Fire Nation's history books. Aang's quest to topple the Fire Lord would ultimately fix this.
<ul><li> There's an earlier episode where history was written by the losers. A town the Gaang visits believes that a former incarnation of the Avatar, Kyoshi, ruthlessly murdered their wise and kind leader. Katara and Sokka find evidence that said ruler was actually a vicious conqueror who was trying to invade the Avatar's home and perished in his quest. When they actually speak to Kyoshi's spirit, she splits the difference: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the leader was indeed trying to conquer her home, and her response was to simply separate from the landmass, creating Kyoshi Island; her opponent was too proud to retreat, so he fell to his death as the land separated, but she doesn't see a distinction and bluntly declares "I killed him."</span>

Additionally, the story completely ignores Victor's role in helping Shuriki (which Elena clearly saw in an earlier vision), along with him and Carla's other crimes, and portrays them as the victims</span>.
