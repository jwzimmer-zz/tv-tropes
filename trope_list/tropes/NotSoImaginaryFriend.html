</li><li> One plot involves Calvin and Hobbes time-traveling shortly into the future, where Calvin <em>should</em> have finished a homework assignment, so he can travel back with it without having done it himself. While Calvin and his time-duplicate argue over who should do the assignment, Hobbes and <em>his</em> time duplicate write it together, and use it to make fun of Calvin and his plan. Calvin, without reading it, turns in the assignment, which is noted as being different and better than Calvin's usual style, and capable of telling jokes at the expense of Calvin, which Calvin is <em>not</em>.
</li><li> Calvin manages to climb trees, which he wouldn't be able to manage alone, with Hobbes giving him a boost to the first branch. Another time Hobbes ties Calvin to a chair. Other characters express amazement that Calvin can do all these things by (or to) himself, even when it's very clear he needs help at certain points in his adventures.
<div class="indent"><strong>Susie:</strong> (<em>watching Calvin and Hobbes wrestle</em>) I don't know what's weirder; that you're fighting your stuffed animal or that you seem to be losing. <br/><strong>Calvin:</strong> I'm not losing! He cheats!

Numerous potential introductions are ruined by Barnaby's parents looking away at just the wrong moment or leaving the room as he enters, and the two steadfastly refuse to believe O'Malley exists in spite of rapidly mounting evidence to the contrary. The strip ends with Barnaby reaching his sixth birthday, forcing Mr. O'Malley to disappear from his life.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>: In an interview on a documentary called <em>Sesame Street Unpaved</em>, hosted by Sonia Manzano (Maria), Snuffy's performer, Martin P. Robinson, revealed that Snuffy was finally introduced to the main human cast because of a string of high profile and sometimes graphic stories of pedophilia and sexual abuse of children on such news programs as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyTwenty">20/20</a></em>. The writers felt that by having the adults refuse to believe Big Bird despite the fact that he was telling the truth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntBelieveMeIfIToldYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntBelieveMeIfIToldYou">they were scaring children into thinking that their parents would not believe them if they had been sexually abused and that they'd just be better off remaining silent.</a> Loretta Long (Susan) corroborated this by uttering the words "Bronx daycare" during Robinson's explanation, a reference to reports of sexual abuse at the PRACA Day Care Center in New York City's Bronx borough, as covered by area TV stations WCBS and WNBC.
</li><li> Around the mid 1970s, children began to see Snuffy. Later on, Muppet characters saw him; Elmo was crucial to helping Big Bird expose the truth.
</li><li> Many children hated how Big Bird was being driven crazy, accused of just imagining him.
<ul><li> In fact, future cast member Alison Bartlett O'Reilly (Gina) would frequently yell at her TV set whenever she saw the scenes.
</li><li> Ironically, all the Praca employees later <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-05/news/mn-15543_1_day-care-center">had their convictions overturned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Doc seems to <em>sort of</em> believe Sprocket, at least in later episodes, but it's not until the finale that he actually sees a Fraggle (Gobo) himself.
<ul><li> In one episode, Red discovers the last of the Lily Creatures, but can't get others to believe her. The one Fraggle who does wants to capture and exploit it, so Red "admits" to making the whole thing up to protect it.
</li><li> The UK version has the same dynamic between Sprocket and the Captain (and his successors). A <em>Fraggle Rock</em> skit on <em>The Children's Royal Variety Performance</em> was introduced by the Captain explaining that all the stories about strange creatures living around the lighthouse were nonsense, while Sprocket gives him an "Are you kidding me?" look.

They encounter Sylvester and chase him into a junkyard, where a vicious black panther that escaped from a zoo just happens to be hiding out. Every time Spike goes into the junkyard to thrash Sylvester, he is clawed into pieces by the panther, which he, in a dark maze of crates, thinks is Sylvester. Chester has no problem pummeling Sylvester before Spike's eyes, which convinces Spike that Chester must be tougher than him.
</li><li> Used yet again another episode involving the same characters in "Dr. Jerkyll's Hide", where once again the dogs chase after Sylvester. Away from Chester's presence, Spike ends up getting beaten up again by Sylvester, thanks to a potion that transforms him into a giant monster. Chester, of course, never sees this transformed Sylvester, thinking his buddy is being beaten by the tiny tomcat. The final loss of face for Alfie (the name of the bulldog in this episode) is his being thrashed by a fly that has also been affected by the potion, as it occurs in front of Chester's eyes.

At Izzy's funeral, Dil puts an end to everything by admitting that Izzy doesn't exist, but once everyone else is gone he tells Chuckie that Izzy wasn't killed and was watching the whole thing in one of the seats in the back. The very end of the episode shows one of the chairs with the seat part down even though no one's there.

<div class="indent"><strong>Puss</strong>: Who is this Sally?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dulcinea</strong>: She's Esme's imaginary friend.

<ul><li> Happens in science way more often than you might think, for example:
<ul><li> <em>Germs</em>
</li><li> <em>Meteorites</em>
</li><li> <em>The platypus</em>. Researchers in 1798 who received a stuffed platypus specimen thought it was a ridiculous hoax, complete with crudely sewn-on leather flap on the bill. But, now, of course, we see the living animal. The same, flabbergasted disbelief happened in reaction to stuffed specimens of the kiwi and the King of Saxony bird of paradise.
</li></ul></li><li> Can occur in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> when one person talks about a friend or significant other that other acquaintances, for whatever reason, never meet.
</li><li> No one believed then-President Jimmy Carter when he claimed that he was attacked by a giant swimming rabbit while on a fishing trip until a White House photographer came forward with a picture of the event. It was a regular-sized <em>swamp rabbit</em>, quite a bit bigger and uglier than the cute little pet-shop bunnies people think of when they hear "rabbit". Even Carter had to agree it was damn funny; he first presented it as an amusing anecdote from his trip.
</li><li> According to <em>The Jargon File</em>, a "dancing frog" is any bug that occurs unpredictably and cannot be readily induced. Such bugs are extremely difficult to deal with. Again a reference to the cartoon (but predating the trope-wiki).
<ul><li> Related is the concept of the "heisenbug", which, for one of several minor reasons, appears only in real-life situations and not in a debugger (a coding environment which is, as the name implies, used to track down bugs). For instance, a bug might only occur when one operation happens too soon after another one, but the debugger runs very slowly so the user can analyze each step to determine where the bug is — meaning the bug won't happen in the first place. These lead to users reporting bugs that developers can't reproduce when they examine the code.
