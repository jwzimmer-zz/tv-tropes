Bagi starts out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a>, but turns more and more feral as time passes.
</li><li> Makaku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em> explicitly references this idea when he becomes quite intelligent after losing his initial large cyborg body and is reduced to an ambulatory head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazblueRemixHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazblueRemixHeart">BlazBlue: Remix Heart</a></em> the mind of the protagonist, who has been magically transformed into a girl, gradually changes into that of a girl as she loses interest in girls and instead starts being attracted to boys and also starts thinking of herself as being a girl rather than a boy in a girl's body.
</li><li> Inverted in one chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatEyedBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatEyedBoy">Cat-Eyed Boy</a></em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> attempts brain transplants... but later discovers they can't be successfully performed, as the new mind housed in the body will eventually force its new body to match the one it was originally housed in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySnatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySnatcher">Body Snatcher</a> Mao needs Phlebotinum to maintain a human level of consciousness; without it, his personality is eventually overridden by the instincts of the cat whose body he inhabits.

While all of them had trouble controlling themselves in their beast transformations at first, only Takuya lost complete control. Except Izumi, for some reason; she attributes her ease of control to being a girl, but says it so obnoxiously that the boys feel ready to throw up. Izumi happens to also have a "beast" transformation that's basically still human in all but the most minor aspects and in fact qualifies as an in-universe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>.

</li><li> As a general rule, Digimon become more brutish with stronger forms unless they cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Bishōnen Line</a>, while how much their actual personality changes varies by how much personality they have to begin with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Saiyans who still have their tails turn into gigantic weremonkeys when exposed to the light of the full moon (or a similar enough substitute), becoming savage and violent no matter how docile they are in their humanlike form. Only Saiyans who have had the proper training can stay in control while transformed. Likewise, there's the Super Saiyan transformations, which turn even the nicest Saiyans (like Goku and Gohan) into the ruthless, cold-hearted warriors Saiyans are known as throughout the universe, with no desire other than to exact painful revenge on whoever angered them enough to trigger the transformation.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, we get the villain Goku Black, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">looks identical to Goku</a>, but makes an indication early on that he originally did not have that appearance. Then we learn the reason for it is that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actually a Supreme Kai named Zamasu who, out of envy and spite, stole the body of an alternate version of Goku.</span> The curious thing about it is that his personality seems to have been altered slightly by this and he's taken on some of Goku's personality traits, particularly his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">desire for battle</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker">need to be challenged</a> and grow stronger. Then after Black actually fights Goku even his <em>speech pattern</em> slowly grows more and more like Goku's. He also starts using some of Goku's fighting stances and techniques, although those are in part deliberate imitations.

When Celty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> witnesses Kujiragi kidnap Shinra, she immediately goes into a rage. This causes her to become a large, black mass that directly correlates to her mental state. It is explained that in this form, unless reunited with her head, Celty will remain a mindless creature. However, when her head is returned, Celty loses all her memories as the Headless Rider and tries to return to her former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPomp">dullahan</a> duties. Luckily, Shinra sees through Celty's lie as she was only faking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">memory loss</a> to make leaving easier. He manages in the end to sever her head and Celty returns to normal</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em>: Implied to be the case with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy</span>. Originally, while extremely ruthless, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy</span> enjoyed taunting people, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>, and far more competent than his manga counterpart. In the movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy has been trapped as dragon for the past two years</span> and while he does speak, he mainly roars and hisses. During his battle with Ed, his behaviour more resembles a deranged animal than the arrogant trash-talker he was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl">Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl</a></em> : <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Former boy</a> Hazumu Osaragi typically responds "I really am a girl now" when her classmates remark on any changes in her behavior. Probably averted since he was extremely feminine in his behavior even before the physical gender-shift.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Evangeline says that she acts much younger than her age because she's been stuck in a ten-year-old body for hundreds of years, and her personality is affected by that form.
</li><li> When Sayo (the ghost of a 15-year-old girl) starts possessing a small doll, she starts acting much more light-hearted and childishly than before.
</li><li> Averted when no one who uses the age-disguising pills ever acts differently unless it's a deliberate act to appear their "age". Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">it just makes Negi appear as old as he acts!</a>
</li><li> In a different kind of example, Albireo Imma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterWeapon">Shapeshifter Weapon</a> allows him to <em>become</em> the person he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">transforms</a> into: all the memories, actions, personality traits and instincts he observes of them are recorded into his many books (he has one for every person he's met). While he's subconsciously aware of his own presence, his body acts completely as the person would, so much that the person themself is essentially speaking. He's able to take over when he needs to, but for the most part the consciousness he imitates is in the driver's seat.
</li><li> Also is Shiori's persona stealing ability which allows her to do largely the same thing, only for her she almost completely blanks out of consciousness to the point of thinking she's the person. However, she does leap instantly to Negi's defense <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and gets badly injured, though the only one to notice the lack of magic canceling was the Governor General.

But not the other way around, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until she starts having feelings for Negi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's more subtle than most examples, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte">Parasyte</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Migi infuses himself into Shinichi's heart and bloodstream to save his life</a></span>, his emotions get duller and duller; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he eventually reacts to a dead dog by throwing it in the garbage, earning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Murano</a> and making him realize what's happened. This prompts him to get better.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, the vast majority of the shapeshifting characters gradually (though not consciously) acclimate to their cursed forms, learning how best to take advantage of their traits (such as size, flight, dexterity, or appearance) and paying heed to their natural instincts.
<ul><li> The most notorious example is with Ranma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">him/herself</a>: although his personality and sexuality remain untouched, he grows considerably more comfortable with his female self, adopting feminine mannerisms and body language. Halfway through the series, (s)he thinks nothing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">dressing up nice</a> and going on dates with men (usually for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">ulterior motive</a>, but sometimes solely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">for the guy's benefit</a>) even though the mere <em>thought</em> of wearing a skirt was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">anathema</a> to him at the beginning of the story. But is it the body working on the mind, or just gradual desensitizing? <br/><br/>In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> episode, Ranma gets knocked on the head while in girl form, making "her" believe she's really a girl (an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyGirl">Girly Girl</a>) who unfortunately changes into a boy. This painfully stereotypical behavior is probably just a reflection of Ranma's own mental image of what "normal girls" are supposed to be like.
</li><li> An extreme example is Miss Hinako Ninomiya: due to an unspecified illness when she was a little girl and Happosai's chi-tampering, her body was stuck with the appearance of a ten year-old, even though she's somewhere in her late twenties. She acts like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">obnoxious, bratty, bossy, hyperactive child</a> while in kid form, but when she absorbs enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a> to temporarily restore her adult body, she's much more aloof and calculating.
</li><li> Another good example is Ranma's father Genma, who actually seems to enjoy being a panda more than being a human, even going so far as to eat bamboo shoots.
</li><li> Then there's Rouge, who turns into an Asura — a three-headed, six-armed, fire-breathing demon-goddess. Normally, she's a kind-hearted Chinese Girl, but in her cursed form she's got a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>, and her temper disappears. Her irritability is partially explained as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a result of the agonizing back-aches caused by having three sets of shoulders</span>. In contrast, Pantyhose Taro turns from bishonen to minotaur-freakshow, without the slightest change in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> personality, although he seems less calculating and more instinctive as a chimera. In his case, he was baptised in the cursed spring soon after he was born. Changing from human to minotaur and back again for all your life is bound to result in a more consistent personality.
</li><li> Kinnii, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">the killer from Jusenkyo</a>, is probably hit by this trope as much as, if not more than, Rouge. A weapon of mass destruction for the "Jusenkyo Preservation Society", he's bulking, bloodthirsty and skilled with his sword; when he shapeshifts into a highly moral priest, he's nothing <em>but</em> a timid and regretful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureLover">Nature Lover</a>, who couldn't even believe (or likely <em>remember</em>) what his natural form is capable of.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShowByRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShowByRock">Show by Rock!!</a></em>, Cyan is a human who was turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girl</a>. She finds herself involuntarily performing cat mannerisms like meowing at times.
</li><li> Used and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows">The World God Only Knows</a></em>.

However, this is because the evil spirit inhabiting the girl's body is manipulating his emotions as the girl has no such problems while in his body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">May also be the case for the goddesses unless Keima really is that much of a chick magnet. Diana has turned tsundere for Keima and Vulcan appears to be following suit.</span>
</li><li> Inugami Hatsune, a member of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren">Zettai Karen Children</a></em> Esper team "The Hound," suffers from this. Her powers allow her to technically assume the form of an animal (typically a canine) but the longer she spends in a form the more animal-like she becomes. Generally, the only way to snap her out of it is to calm her down by feeding her. This is the task of her partner, Yadorigi Akira, whose mind-switch powers allow him to throw prey in front of her to catch (and also forces him to experience the feeling of prey being eaten each time).

Temporary transformations, such as those induced by Fred and George's Canary Creams (which in any case don't seem to be totally inhuman transformations, since the person who undergoes it remains the same size) skirt the line, but are broadly fine.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEvilWizardSmallbone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEvilWizardSmallbone">The Evil Wizard Smallbone</a></em>, whenever someone is shapeshifted into an animal, they become that animal in mind and body unless they've been trained on how to keep their mind intact. This is how the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">keeps his minions in line</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> used this a lot:
<ul><li> Every animal morph came with its own set of animal instincts; these were mostly useful, but some morphs (such as an ant) had instincts so strong they risked permanently overpowering the human personality.
</li><li> Termites caused even greater problems, since they were entirely controlled by pheromones the bodies were hard-wired to obey.
</li><li> Taxxons are horrifying, as they are completely consumed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a>, causing them to instantly consume anything even remotely edible around them (including their injured comrades). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Yeerks</a> with Taxxon host bodies cannot stop the feeding once it starts and can barely make the host body focus on anything besides feeding; morphing into a Taxxon causes similar issues. The hunger is so bad that a group of dissident Taxxons agree to help the Animorphs in exchange for being allowed to morph into some less-ravenous forms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock">stay in those forms for more than two hours</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>, Belgarath points out that transforming into an eagle wouldn't necessarily help you travel faster, because you were likely to get sidetracked by every tasty animal below, observing that while they <em>look</em> magnificent, eagles are really very stupid birds. More generally, this is a hazard of shapeshifting, with Belgarath dedicating an extended passage in his self-narrated prequel to explaining the insidious effect that taking animal form can have, since the change is absolute - an extended period as a wolf, for instance, leaves him interested in the idea of a wolfish life and taking up with a young female wolf who's taken an interest in him, daydreaming of the hunt, companionship of a mate, cubs, etcetera. Interestingly, the reverse also applies, as his wife, Poledra, was originally a wolf (in fact, she was the young female wolf mentioned above), and after giving up on the idea of him mating with her as a wolf, changed into a form he'd find more attractive - a woman. The narration makes very explicit that she is now a woman - one who used to be a wolf, and could transform back whenever she wished (among many other things), but still a woman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackChalker">Jack Chalker</a>, as can be expected by the prevalence of transformation plots in his writing, makes frequent use of this.

</li><li> Especially nasty in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulRider">Soul Rider</a></em> series, where the revolutionary state of New Eden imposes this on its female population by a binding spell. A transformed "Fluxgirl" is literally ruled by her body, which now craves constant sex, has difficulty with concentration on long-term projects, and cannot read, write, calculate, or figure out complicated machinery.
</li><li> Chalker also specifically inverts this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIdentityMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIdentityMatrix">The Identity Matrix</a></em>, where the body can be made the plaything of the mind by making mental adjustments that influence the endocrine system, affecting things like muscle development and fat distribution.
</li></ul></li><li> A curious variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheGreatGlassElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheGreatGlassElevator">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</a></em>: When Grandma Georgina (who is in her late 70s) is aged to 300+ years old via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aging</a> formula, her memories change to reflect the times she would have been born in and lived through had she come to this point naturally. (Her earliest memory is arriving in America on the <em>Mayflower</em>.) When she is returned to her natural age, these memories apparently disappear.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a></em> stories, the outer god Nyarlathotep is said to have a thousand forms. Each form is essentially a separate entity (it's implied that he can even manifest several in forms at once). As such, the behaviour and personality of different forms can be completely different. This is only vaguely implied in the original works, but considering that Nyarlathotep's different forms functions essentially identically to the Avatars of Hindu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythology">mythology</a>, this is indeed probably the case, although a central intelligence connects them all in some sense.
</li><li> In <em>Oath of Gold</em>, the third volume of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethMoon">Elizabeth Moon</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeedOfPaksenarrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeedOfPaksenarrion">The Deed of Paksenarrion</a></em>, the Kuakgan talks about this with Paks, who was unable to continue her life as a paladin-in-training after being captured, tormented, and rescued, and who is at the brink of suicide when he finds her leaving her worldly goods in his grove's offering-bowl. She also hasn't eaten properly for quite a while, and has a lot of half-healed wounds. The analogy he draws between the mind and the body is that of the snail and the snail-shell; if you poke holes in the snail-shell, will the snail live?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series plays it relatively straight. One notable example, and a reference back to it in a later book, likens the mind to water and the body to a jug or vase. The water is only water, it does not become the container, but it does take on the container's shape.
<ul><li> The longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolves</a> spend in wolf form, the more they start to think like a wolf. The reverse is also true: They become more human the longer they spend in human form. They never entirely become one or the other.
</li><li> The same is true of Borrowing: The longer you inhabit something else's brain, the more you start thinking like that something else. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites">Equal Rites</a></em>, Esk nearly starves to death because she loses track of her human self, but doesn't have the proper instincts to feed herself as a falcon.
</li><li> The Great God Om points out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> that the shape of the body influences the shape of the mind, so if you spend too long in the body of, say, a tortoise, you begin to think like a tortoise.
</li><li> When the Auditors create human bodies for themselves, they eventually start feeling emotions. The end result is a mix of Auditor and human that has serious trouble being either.
</li><li> The point of the "water in a jug" analogy is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Myria LeJean's</span> realization that it is <em>wrong</em>; for a mind in a body, the "water" is truly changed by the jug.

<ul><li> One of the laws of magic is to never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">change someone's form against their will</a>: it will eventually destroy their mind, leaving just a normal animal. Changing your own form is allowed  partly because it's consensual by definition, partly because people who transform themselves instinctively protect their minds to avert this trope  but still carries risks.
</li><li> A good example of a first-person viewpoint to this trope is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry's transformation into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">a hexenwulf</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoolMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoolMoon">Fool Moon</a></em>, and subsequent gradual loss of control to the monstrous wolf's beastly instincts</span>. Hearing it from his narration is pretty freaky, and when he turns back, he's sickened and horrified.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes">Changes</a></em>, the main characters are transformed into a pack of hounds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as part of a plan to sneak into the stronghold of the Red Court vampires</span>. Despite everyone involved being willing to undergo the change, the transformed characters slowly start thinking more and more like dogs, gradually forgetting the urgency to turn back into humans once they get where they need to go.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">Skin Game</a></em>, the shapeshifter Goodman Grey <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transforms into a different man, but immediately starts exhibiting the man's nervousness and fear at the situation he was in before he died</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea">Earthsea</a></em> stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, shapeshifting works this way: the longer a wizard stays in a given form, the more his mind is taken over by that form's instincts, and the more he risks forgetting he was ever a man. Legends say many mages turned themselves permanently into dolphins this way, and one tragic fable concerns a wizard who so enjoyed turning himself into a bear that he ultimately <em>became</em> the bear and killed his own son.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardOfEarthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardOfEarthsea">A Wizard of Earthsea</a></em> this happens to protagonist Ged. He almost loses his mind when he is forced to flee over a long distance as a hawk. By the time he escapes, Ged is so far gone he does not remember magic, so he cannot change himself back. Instead he flies — probably by animal instinct — to a familiar place: the house of Ogion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a>. Because Ogion is a powerful wizard who knows Ged's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">True Name</a>, he can restore his former student's body to human form. However, it takes time for Ged to recover psychologically: weeks pass before he can even speak.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is a recurring element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fablehaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fablehaven">Fablehaven</a></em>. When you transform (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the exception of the Eternals' guardians</span>) you become yourself if you had been born a member of that species. It's most used with magical creatures that have human avatars, but it was a major plot point in the first book when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grandma</span> had to fight her chicken instincts to get a message through.
</li><li> In Robin Jarvis' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hagwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hagwood">Hagwood</a></em> trilogy, the insect monster known as Frighty Aggie was once a werling named Agnilla Hellekin. She was so skilled that she could wergle (that is, transform) into any forest creature. However, she wanted a bigger challenge, so decided to try wergling into an insect. This had never been attempted by anyone before and was regarded as highly dangerous. Still, she successfully managed to do so three times, but each time her mind was being irreparably damaged. On the third try, she could not wergle back to her original form and permanently became a grotesque insect monster with no memory of who she had been before. Her story became a cautionary tale to all werlings to never try wergling into shapes that were forbidden to them.
</li><li> This trope plays both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: If a person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">involuntarily transfigured into an animal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">(and this includes werewolves)</a>, then they lose their human mind for the duration of the spell. However, with years of study, and at great risk, a wizard can train him/her self to transform into an animal at will and retain their human mind — mostly. (Wormtail suffered no ill effects from being a rat for twelve years straight, but Sirius sometimes turned into a dog to ameliorate the stress caused by Dementors.)
<ul><li> Sirius also once says that James had always joked he had a much sweeter disposition as a dog, implying that there are at least mild changes in personality/attitude which reflect the behavioral patterns of the animal they transform into. Of course this aspect is debatable because of the fact that the wizard doesn't choose which animal they transform into, they find out only once they've completed the training and see what they become (much like the Patronus charm), and implies that the animagus form reveals, in part, the true nature of the character in question. Even so, it is easy to see that a character like Sirius may have very playful and loyal dog-like nature, but frequently behave in harsh or unforgiving ways due to the emotional and psychological trauma of his human life, which might be less at the forefront of his mind because of the less linear nature of the dog's mind. It is also the way he escaped Azkaban without notice — the Dementors could not detect the less complex dog mind, and therefore didn't realize a human was leaving the prison.
</li><li> Likewise, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Horcrux</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> because it's the inverse of a mortal—the spirit it contains will instantly die if it's destroyed, but the physical self regenerates.
</li><li> The author also noted that animagi tend to suffer a sharp decrease in IQ when in animal form, presumably due to the shrinkage in brain size.
</li></ul></li><li> The Souls from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost">The Host</a></em> are strongly affected by natural instincts and sometimes memories of their hosts. If a human host loved someone before the transformation and this feeling was mutual, its very likely their souls will become a couple. It happens even if souls haven't met each other before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos">Journey to Chaos</a></em>: When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eric</span> mana mutates into a grendel, his personality and worldview permanently change.

</li><li> The short story "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyIntoFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyIntoFox">Lady Into Fox</a>" was this in a nutshell. It's about a refined elegant woman, and her husband who was a fox hunter. One day she—with no explanation—turns into a talking fox. They try to live their lives as best as they can, but she gradually starts to lose her mind. She becomes more interested in chasing rabbits; soon enough she slowly loses her humanity, forgetting who her husband is and losing her ability to talk. The once well-mannered dainty lady is now eating live rabbits in the living room, with blood everywhere. It was never explained why she transformed but it's implied God or some karmic force punished her husband for killing foxes for a living.

To plan for this, the Princeps is sometimes hard-wired to the Titan to start with. This will happen automatically if the Titan falls to Chaos, and the Princeps is then merged physically as well as mentally.

Whenever she creates another instance of her consciousness to possess something, it acts more or less how you would expect a sentient version of that thing to act.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">the original</a>, the only alien that did this was Greymatter, mostly to fulfill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar">Intelligent Equals Cultured</a> trope.
<ul><li> Ben did say Ghostfreak made him feel weird, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">for a good reason.</a>
</li><li> Also happens whenever Ben turns into Rath. He becomes quick to anger in that form.
</li><li> And also his 'Big Chill' alien gave birth to alien babies after it took over Ben's mind several times in order to build a nest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated this was due to asexual reproduction.
</li><li> In <em>Omniverse</em> when Ben transforms into his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inkursian form Bullfrag</span> he suddenly finds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Attea</span> very attractive.

He discovers the downside to this when he uploads himself into an adolescent clone so he can hang out with his grandkids. The younger body's adolescent drives overwhelm his mind, trapping him inside "Tiny Rick". He is only able to express his plight through creative expression - for example, when "Tiny Rick" does a song and dance routine, the lyrics are actually Rick begging to be let out of the body. Rick is only able to briefly return to his old self when hearing sad Elliott Smith music reminds him that he's actually an old man. The first thing he does when he returns to his original body is to hack apart the clones with an ax.

<ul><li> The changes in behavior and personality caused by anti-depressants and other psychiatric medications, lobotomies, and brain injuries attest to how changes in the brain can cause sometimes major changes in the mind. All sorts of odd quirks and personality changes caused by brain disorders that go away if those disorders are ameliorated, a nice person becoming a cranky one under the influence of stress (or other) hormones, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">cheerful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">endured</a> tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> becoming paranoid and bedridden when they get old enough for clinical depression <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">to kick in</a>. it's very well demonstrated that the personality is a creation of the physical structure of the brain, and even minor physical and chemical changes can turn someone into a very different person, <em>forget</em> turning into a different species. There's also puberty, PMS, or menopause, all of which tend to induce mood swings ranging from inconvenient to debilitating.
<ul><li> Neurological studies of patients with mental disorders show that all these conditions are associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function. The way psychiatric medicines work is by causing changes in brain function that mitigate the processes that generate the symptoms forming a certain mental disorder. It's still unknown how many of these medications precisely work, since it is very difficult to link what these medications do at the biochemical level with the mental changes they effect considering the tremendous complexity of the human brain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">from the complex chemical reactions that occur in each neuron to the way the millions of neurons interact</a>.
</li><li> There's endless medical conditions that could cause altered mental status or psychiatric disorders, but here's a small sample of those caused by physiological disorders: there are mental disturbances secondary to hyper-or-hypothyroidism. Errors in sex hormone metabolism can change the development of the body and brain, as can production of stress hormones. Speaking of sex hormones, testosterone causes what can only be called "stereotypical maleness." Cancers can produce hormones that cause electrolyte or other imbalances that mess with the mind. Tissue changes in Diabetes I and II can cause altered mental status via hypo-or-hyper blood glucose. A stroke, injury, embolism, hemorrhage in the brain can cause all manner of terrifying neural deficits depending on the part of the brain affected. A mass effect from an tumor in the head can press on brain structures. Failures of the kidneys or livers can cause all sorts of toxic product build-up or electrolyte imbalances.
</li><li> There's also the story of Phineas Gage, a famous person one will no doubt learn about in any Psychology 101 class, who <a class="urllink" href="http://boeatau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/phineas-gage.jpg">took an iron rod to the head<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (warning: pic might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>). He had a significant personality change as a result, and his friends remarked that he was "no longer Gage." This case began the idea that changes to the brain's physiology will have an impact on behavior and personality. Though how much of the changed behaviour was attributable to brain injury and how much to post-traumatic stress disorder, the chronic pain he suffered afterwards and the heavy drinking Gage resorted to as a coping mechanism for both are a matter for conjecture.
</li><li> Recreational drugs change the way your brain functions, and in doing so alter yours perceptions and behavior, which are essentially transient personality changes. For example, alcohol diminishes inhibitions and makes you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">do things that you would never do while sober</a>, dopaminergic stimulants can make you manic and obsess over the most mundane things, or in high doses cause paranoia, and MDMA can make you empathic and sociable. These effects generally only last while the drug is in your system. However, when they cause long term changes and damage, the effects and the resultant alterations to your psyche, which unlike the drugs immediate effects are generally very unpleasant, are long lasting. It is why recovery from drug abuse can be so long and tortuous, and even recovered drug addicts may never return to how they once were.
</li></ul></li><li> The Proteus Effect — peoples' avatars in virtual worlds affect how they interact.
</li><li> The physical transition period from childhood to adulthood is not an easy or pleasant one for most people.
</li><li> This is the premise of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">the embodied mind thesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which holds that all aspects cognition are influenced by bodily characteristics as innocuous as <a class="urllink" href="http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:77180:6/component/escidoc:77181/Casasanto_2009_jepg.pdf">hand dominance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Having one's stomach surgically reduced in size would seem like a purely physical change, the simple inability to eat as much as before. For some people that's what it works out to, with frustration resulting. For others it results in the feeling of having enough willpower to not consume as much, or just being less interested in food.
</li><li> Sleep deprivation. Its something that everyone has experienced, and for an unfortunate many quite frequently, and even if you are not very aware on how you change when sleep deprived, you have probably seen how someone else who is sleep deprived who is usually calm or cheerful become cranky.
