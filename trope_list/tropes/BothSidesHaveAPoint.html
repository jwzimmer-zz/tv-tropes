<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarakuridoujiUltimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarakuridoujiUltimo">Karakuridouji Ultimo</a></em>, the protagonist Yamato learns he is the cause of an apocalypse in the near future. Yamato chooses to avert this by finding every person in the world who would be involved in the event and understanding their points of view so that he can choose the best possible action once the time comes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em> every character has a reasonable explanation and motivation for their actions. San is harsh and violent - but only wants to protect her home, family and the natural world. Eboshi wants to kill the god of the forest - but is a benevolent leader, good to her people and kind to lepers and you can fully see why her people are willing to die for her. The protagonist Ashitaka is completely neutral and genuinely wants the best for everyone. Even if the consequences of their choices are ultimately negative, you can see why they did it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: The Shinigami and Quincies have warred for a thousand years, partly because Quincies destroy Hollow souls as punishment for the killing of humans while Shinigami insist on cleansing Hollow souls back into the reincarnation cycle. Quincies refuse to accept that their actions threaten existence itself while Shinigami refuse to accept that they're overwhelmed by Hollow numbers and need help. Members of both sides have observed that war means both sides are justified and both sides are evil. Complicating matters is the true origin of the war, known only to a very few on both sides, which centers around the mysterious connection between the Quincy King and the Shinigami Soul King both of whom may not be what they seem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> is about this between the cast of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>, centered around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Yang Wen-li</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Reinhard von Lohengramm</a>. The former prefers democracy since leadership can be voted out by consent of the people, who aren't forced with a choice between obedience and execution. The latter favors efficiency and if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">right ruler</a> is in place, society's well-being can exceed any democracy.
<ul><li> Similarly is the argument with Rudolph von Goldenbaum, the founder of the Galactic Empire. As an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Hitler, Rudolph is loathed by the Alliance as a symbol of tyranny for regulating the most basic of freedoms and purging diverse customs. On the other hand, the member of the Empire find his actions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a> since the precursor nation of the Galactic Republic was in a far worse state, plagued not only by political corruption but also rotten-to-the-core, morally-decaying society.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens more than once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe">Ashita no Joe</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Danpei asks to be reinstated as a boxing coach, the Japan Boxing Commission refuses to verify if he can do the job and treats him like crap. Danpei, however, admits that, after being barred for his alcoholism, mistreating his boxers, getting into fights with the opponents of his boxers, the referees and the public, <em>and</em> assaulting a JBC official when they suspended him, they had all the more reason not to trust him, especially after his reaction to their refusal was to get drunk, storm the JBC building and assault the boxing club presidents that made the JBC up.
</li><li> After Joe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally kills Rikiishi in a fight</span> and starts winning his fights with devastating attacks on the torso, the JBC club presidents decide to force him to retire for both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">not retiring in shame after he killed an opponent</a></span> and the serious injuries he's inflicting to his opponents. On the other hand, Joe is far more devastated by that event than they suspect, hitting only the torso because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he developed an unconscious fear of killing his opponents like he did with Rikiishi</span> and returned to the ring in part because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">he feels that he owes to Rikiishi to win the championships he would have surely won had he not died.</a></span>
</li><li> Once he's forced to fight in circus rings, Joe is appalled when the other fighters of the circus reveal they fix their matches, seeing it as an insult to any serious boxer and themselves and a scam to the paying public. The others admit he's right... but every single one of them needs money to pay debts, maintain their family, and other urgent reasons and, while they have no skill but boxing, they aren't good enough to become professionals (or remain professionals, in one case), and if they don't fix their matches they risk being injured and being forced not to work while they heal.
</li><li> After Joe goes back to the official circuit and becomes famous, he develops a feud with the world champion José Mendoza, with Joe gaining his enmity with continued insults and shouts, even after being informed that Mendoza cannot stand loudmouths. Joe is furious at Mendoza bragging he defeated Joe's friend Carlos Rivera so hard he forced him to retire for medical reasons. To complicate things further, there's the fact José is bragging about that because, for a long time, there were rumors he refused to fight him for fear of losing his title, and as soon as he won the match, Carlos' manager explained Mendoza's easy victory with José causing him brain damage in their fight, a damage to his reputation that the world champion just cannot let stand, and Joe, even knowing that, is incensed because he knows <em>he</em> caused Carlos the brain damage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When it's proven without a doubt that Carlos' manager was wrong and Joe was indeed the one to cause the brain damage, Joe stops provoking him, just concentrating on the imminent title match between the two.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Episode 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga">Zombie Land Saga</a></em> marks a rift forming between Ai and Junko over their conflicting views on how the idol industry should work based on what was normal in their respective times: for Junko, it means putting herself at arm's length from the public so she may present her ideal self that she wants her admirers to strive towards. For Ai, it means forging close relationships with her fans and using their support to propel herself forward. Unfortunately, their mutual inability or refusal to understand each other due to their own deeply rooted issuesJunko's feelings that her efforts were rendered meaningless, and Ai's unwillingness to accept her own premature deathkeeps them from seeing eye-to-eye. The trope itself is also discussed when the other girls try convincing them to bury the hatchet.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Ai:</strong> I don't see how any of what I said was wrong. <br/><strong>Yugiri:</strong> There are plenty of fights that start because both sides have a good point.
</div><ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided">A House Divided</a> situation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both groups of students have a good reason for their choice. The group that wants to save Koro-sensei thinks they can't kill him after all they've been through and should therefore try to save him and the world. The group that wants to still try to kill him is worried about what happens if they cannot find a way to save Koro-sensei and the fact that by killing him they'd be following his own expressed wishes.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: In the aftermath of Shirogane visiting a sick Kaguya, in which both sides are angry at each other, the narrator observes that from their perspective, each of them has legitimate reasons to be annoyed with the other. Shirogane, despite being forcibly pulled into bed with Kaguya, hadn't done anything untoward to her. As for Kaguya, she doesn't remember what she did while she was sick. Despite this, both Kaguya and Shirogane gradually realize that they've been unfair to the other in their respective conversations with Kashiwagi and Ishigami, even as their conversation partner takes their side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>, there's the dispute between Haruyuki Arita and Kuroyukihime over whether the former's friend, Chiyuri Kurashima, is actually Cyan Pile, the Burst Linker hunting Kuroyukihime.
<ul><li> While Haruyuki is ultimately right that it isn't Chiyuri, Kuroyukihime has legitimate reasons for suspecting Chiyuri, considering that the Burst Linker challenged Kuroyukihime while she was connected to her school's intranet, and Chiyuri goes to Kuroyukihime and Haruyuki's school. It later turns out that the culprit used a backdoor program in Chiyuri's Neurolinker, but since Haruyuki was unable to obtain evidence of the program's existence, Kuroyukihime realizes that he could be lying in order to protect his friend. Kuroyukihime also notices Chiyuri's hostility toward her, and while Haruyuki claims Chiyuri's jealous of their closeness, Kuroyukihime points out that it doesn't make sense, since Chiyuri has a boyfriend.
</li><li> As for Haruyuki, he realizes that Chiyuri isn't very good at video games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">or lying</a>, so the idea of her secretly being a Burst Linker is ridiculous, especially considering that Cyan Pile is Level 4. Likewise, he realizes that there are other reasons for her hostility toward Kuroyukihime, and he's right that Chiyuri is jealous about Kuroyukihime succeeding in helping him. He also manages to find out that Chiyuri isn't a Burst Linker, even if Kuroyukihime is skeptical of his claims.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, the <em>Mother's Rosary</em> arc has the dispute between Asuna and her mother Kyouko over whether she should continue attending the SAO Survivors' School. Kyouko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">stresses the importance of getting a good education</a>, and points out that the school is little more than a way for the government to monitor the teenage survivors of Sword Art Online (which Kirito had noticed earlier, and which Asuna mentally concedes in the light novel). Asuna doesn't deny what her mother is saying, but is happy at her school and has her own vision for the future. In the end, Kyouko relents and lets Asuna stay at the school as long as she keeps her grades up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee">Letter Bee</a></em>, Episode 18 involves some self-styled Letter Pigeons who are fed up with the high rate of postage in Amberground and challenge the Letter Bees to a competition. On the one hand, they're right about the mail being too expensive for many; Nelli took extreme measures to deliver her brother's letter because she couldn't afford the stamps. The situation was even worse for an orphanage in the Letter Pigeons' hometown, which was what inspired them to form their own group. On the other hand, Lag's right when he says that not just anyone can do the Letter Bees' job, and he's proven right when the Letter Pigeons prove helpless against the Gaichuu. Considering how long it can take to deliver even a simple letter, and the danger involved, it's only natural that it would cost a lot.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, Superman and his crew are right that the anti-heroes have become too bloodthirsty and overzealous, blurring the binary of hero and villain, losing track of concepts like collateral damage and simply not caring about the people not on their power level. <em>But</em> the anti-heroes are also right in their belief that simply beating up supervillains and tossing them in jail is a temporary solution at best and useless at worst because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a> and that more violent action is the only counter to the less-restrained villains.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel">Justice League of America: Tower of Babel</a></em>, when the rest of the League discover that Batman devised plans to defeat them (in the event of them being brainwashed, possessed, or going evil/insane on their own), the team debate about their response to this discovery. Plastic Man, Aquaman and Wonder Woman regard it as a betrayal from someone they trusted while Kyle Rayner, Wally West and J'onn J'onzz acknowledge that Batman's reasons for coming up with the plans in the first place was valid even if they're angry at him for coming up with the plans in the first place (Superman also voted against Batman's acts, reasoning that Batman could have at least told them the plans existed without compromising their effectiveness).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> <em>Schism</em> event, which leads to the second volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen">Uncanny X-Men</a></em> and to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em>, both Cyclops <em>and</em> Wolverine have valid points:
<ul><li> Wolverine is correct that Cyclops' new, militant approach to the mutant race's survival goes against what Xavier intended for the X-Men, and that he seems to have forgotten that the X-Men were supposed to be teachers and educators for mutants. There's a reason practically half of the teaching staff abandons Utopia so as to be able to go back to being teachers, not defenders.
</li><li> However, Cyclops is <em>also</em> correct in his points, and his points arguably have a lot more weight to them. The X-Men are living in a world that is more hostile towards mutants than ever before, and with barely 200 mutants alive on Earth at the present, they <em>need</em> to be able to pull together and make humans see they won't just roll over and die to any bigots who come knocking. It's telling that many of the students choose to remain with Cyclops, pointing out to their Wolverine-siding fellows that A: more students <em>died</em> in the Xavier Institute than have ever died on Utopia, and B: they are living in a world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">overrules any concept of kids as non-targets in a racial war.</a> As the spokesperson for the Cyclops-loyalists so eloquently puts it, the second a mutant's X-gene activates, they <em>stop</em> being a kid and start being a <em>target</em> for every anti-mutant bigot in a world crawling with them. And if one must be a target, then better to be a target who can shoot back.
</li><li> This can also be used for the initial conflict between Xavier and Magneto. Xavier goes the democratic route, hoping for peace, but the amount of destructive mutants in the world tends to over rule peace talks. Although Magneto does go overboard sometimes (killing innocents, trying to destroy the world, bad stuff), he has a point that a war between mutants and humans was always going to happen. Any time things look like they'll get better, a shady government agency or the Sentinels or a random human faction will come along and murder a bunch of mutants. Mutants that aren't ready to fight will most surely die. This is one of the reasons he joins Cyclops after Schism.

Yaoyorozu counters that it's kind of hard to plan for someone who can use swords to deflect bullets, which he agrees to.

Robb supports The Company as their ideas and technology have improved the lives of their people and allowed the North to modernize and industrialize into a modern nation with a well-equipped army. Ned counters The Company's "help" has caused pollution, and their people's traditions, culture, and values are being threatened by The Company's greed.

Both were wrong in the case that the former didn't have to hire the latter, an infertile youkai, as a wet-nurse and had a right for wanting Reimu back, as there was an agreement and the aforementioned is her child. However at the same time, the latter has a reason for wanting her, too, in that she cannot have children and took care of her since birth. However, they both could have worked something out, which is subtly expressed. Amoridere acknowledged this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Amoridere</strong>: Ya' gotta admit, both of them are at fault, as Mikosan asked an infertile youkai to be a wet nurse, when she could have asked an ordinary human to do and Yukari could have worked something out after she had to return Reimu. [...] Yes, yes, if anything their rivalry seemed to be irrational at best but both are pretty reasonable in feeling the way they do.
</div></li><li> A running theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ImperfectMetamorphosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ImperfectMetamorphosis">Imperfect Metamorphosis</a></em> is that everyone are doing things for justifiable reasons, but their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">conflicting methods</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">refusal to communicate</a> leads to mistrust and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">infighting,</a> which leads to <em>more</em> mistrust and infighting.

Characters like Reimu and Byakuren acknowledge this trope and try for a peaceful, mutually beneficial resolution, but it doesn't work out too well. The only exceptions are Rumia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, for obvious reasons, and <em>maybe</em> Yuuka, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">who knows what she's thinking</a>.

Fai points while Syaoran is an adult, Kurogane should have known better than to take up Syaoran's offer for a relationship because they know that he's still in love with Sakura. Syaoran points that he's capable of making his own decisions and that he is also to blame for keeping a relationship a secret. Syaoran points that it was his decision who he tells because he wasn't never with Sakura. Kurogane points that group relations were hostile and Fai treated Syaoran like crap most of the time, so Fai has no right to stay something now.

Apple's right that Rotbart is abandoning his responsibility to his story which could doom both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake">Swan Lake</a></em> and it's very demanding that he expects for her to accept him. Rotbart is right that Apple's story will be fine with a replacement villain, especially someone who actually wants to play villain and no one knows if defying one's fate will doom the story. If Apple complains that he's too evil, well he's a <em>villain.</em> He points out that Apple is so used to the non-threatening and benign Raven being her villain, she is not used to the idea that she would actually have to work for her happy ending with a genuinely evil villain.

Marinette is later shocked when her entire class side with Chat Noir because of how cold Ladybug was and how dejected he looked afterwards, despite her pointing out that he put her on the spot while already knowing that she had to leave urgently. Alya concedes the point after rewatching Ladybug's reaction on the video, as does Chat Noir the next time he sees her. In turn, Ladybug apologises to Chat after realising that he was sincere and it becomes clear this is affecting their partnership. "The way I treated you wasn't right. I totally disregarded your feelings and let my own frustration and anxiety get the better of me. I still think your timing was atrocious, and I don't think it was right of you to put me on the spot like that. However, even if my feelings weren't the same, I shouldn't have treated your feelings like they didn't matter. I'm sorry."

Xander admits he's been giving Buffy the cold shoulder since she came back and he was wrong to try to ruin her relationship with Angel in the past. Buffy realizes that she should apologize for letting her friends think she was dead for months and that Xander understands her staking Angel since he had to stake Jesse, whom he considered his brother.
</li><li> Naruto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Eroninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Eroninja">Eroninja</a></em> states that he understands why Minato sealed the Kyuubi within him, explaining that the man had to make a choice between doing what's best for his village and what's best for his family. While Naruto doesn't begrudge Minato his decision, Naruto doesn't think he'd ever be able to sacrifice his family in favor of the village.

Initially, he arranges for the future SPD Rangers- Sky, Bridge, Z and Syd- to be taken from their parents and raised at the SPD academy so that they can be prepared to act as Earth's defenders when Emperor Grumm finally reaches Earth, reasoning at the time that this is the only way to be certain that Earth will be ready. However, after the parents are reunited with their adult children, Crueger finds himself considering the fact that <em>all</em> of their parents were former Power Rangers who would have likely raised their children to be ready to fight for Earth anyway, but then realises the problem with <em>that</em> view as Bridge's parents lived on Mirinoi and may not have been willing to relocate to Earth, Crueger cursing himself over the fact that <em>both</em> perspectives have flaws.

</li><li> Ash and Red have a rather big argument in Chapter 27 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines">Pokémon Reset Bloodlines</a></em> in regards to using their bloodline abilities in competitive battling (Red can see the potential outcome of any move he will make in a battle and the accompanying odds of it leading to victory while Ash can give his Pokémon brief power boosts). Red believes that not using them is the same as a naturally gifted person not giving their all, and views Ash as arrogant and disrespectful to his opponents for acting this way. Ash, on the other hand, views his abilities as an unfair advantage that normal humans can't compete against, as well as thinking that if he uses it, it would mean he didn't believe in his Pokémon's strength, only using his abilities in situations where either his Pokémon would have otherwise died or the consequences of losing would have been far worse than just a lost battle. The story doesn't take either side, instead allowing readers to draw their own conclusions. Ultimately, further developments resulted in both Ash and Red seeing where the other was coming from, with Red encountering someone who used his philosophy of always going all out to respect your opponents as an excuse to be a bully and Ultima pointing out that it's a good thing to hold back to not kill or maim your opponent, especially when sparring, and Ash winning a battle that left a bad taste in his mouth after learning his opponent wasn't using his best team.
</li><li> The center of Kurama and Kakashi's conflict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BlackkatsReverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BlackkatsReverse">Blackkat's Reverse</a></em>. Kurama is right that the villages treat their jinchuuriki horribly and dont know how to train them to their full potential. Hiruzen even admits that their treatment can be considered child abuse on anyone else. But Kakashi is right that Kurama is a kidnapper, as hes taking young and malleable jinchuuriki from their villages and is igniting tensions between the Great Ninja Villages. Konoha barely managed to prevent another Shinobi War from breaking out.

She believes that her friends were corrupted by some sapient force, and wants to revert them back — which would involve keeping Jhon alive in the chance that he, too, can become regular John. Both parties want what's best for their friends, and the issue lies in seeing Jhon as a murderer (which is true, as he not only killed Swet Bro purposefully, but he also tried to hide the evidence by baking it in to a cake) or as an innocent friend that has fallen victim to a multiversal corruption that made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">Not Himself</a> (which is also true to an extent — Rose has memories of everything being normal, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and while she <em>was</em> shitty until being "enhanced" at the beginning of the story</span>, signs point to it being possible to break John and the others out of whatever it is that's affecting the world).

</li><li> Both Tsukune's group and the HDA admit this in Act VI chapter 50. While Moka and co. had good reason to be annoyed with the HDA, considering they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">automatically deemed all monsters evil</a> based on the actions of a few, the HDA was only acting in self-defense and doing their jobs; as they point out, if humans had been responsible for an attack on a monster city, monsters would have reacted exactly the same way. The latter point is especially poignant, since back in chapter 40, Headmaster Mikogami made those exact same points to the other Dark Lords.

Lapis states that the Gems didn't even try to free her, but the Gems thought that all Gem-based items (like Lapis' mirror) were "dead" gems that didn't have a personality or memories, so they had no reason to do so.

Tatsuki demands they free the prisoners while Ichigo insists they don't. Tatsuki's argument is that it'd be inhumane to simply leave the women there to die while Ichigo's counter is that they have no common language, so they can't be sure the ogre women wouldn't attack them and they're in a videogame so said women aren't real. Immediately afterwards, Ichigo has to go through a blood sacrifice to open a locked door (Tatsuki doesn't have enough health to do it) and Tatsuki mocks him for his pain. Ichigo fires back that while those women are fake, his pain is very real and that's the second time he's had to make said sacrifice.

Mob also notes how Izuku and Todoroki are taking things too seriously and someone is going to get hurt, then goes as far as to suggest that Izuku should give up. Izuku bites back saying that he has a lot to prove and that Mob is trying to hold him back because of his own insecurities. On one hand, Mob has no right to keep his friend from doing anything less then his best, and has no clue what Izuku had to go though in his life whereas Mob is fairly privileged (Mob was born with an immensely powerful quirk whereas Izuku was born quirkless). Izuku is also right in pointing out that Mob doesnt know what he wants in life, and as such, can't see why someone like Izuku would put himself through the things he does. On the other hand, Mob is not in the wrong for being so concerned with his friend's health, and Izuku shouldnt make promises he isn't sure he can keep.

Jason, of course, wants Joker dead, convinced the world would be better off without him causing constant chaos and destruction in his wake, which Batman even concedes that allowing Joker to die would make things a lot easier for Gotham, and a maniac like him would absolutely deserve everything coming to him. Batman, however, steadfastly refuses to end Joker's life, noting how it would become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier">far too easy</a> to go around killing other criminals, leaving him to become no better than the Clown Prince of Crime ever was, therefore making Batman his own worst enemy, and in turn would undermine the efforts he's put in to make Gotham safer.

On the other hand, Anna has a lonely and isolated life secluded in the castle with a completely distant sister, and the gates are about to shut the next day and cut off future opportunities to meet other people, so it's understandable that she wants to take what may be her only chance to marry someone who shows her affection and doesn't shut her out. Ultimately their inability to see the other's points leads into a huge argument that leads to Elsa snapping at her sister, revealing her powers in the process. In the end, Anna learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">love and friendliness aren't the same thing, while Elsa learns that shutting people out is not the solution to her problem and learns that opening up her heart with love is the key to control her powers.</span>

Unlike the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">"Black Friday" reel</a> where Woody was depicted as an egoistical tyrant, the final film shows that his reasons for disliking Buzz do have merit; after all, Buzz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellFictionFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellFictionFromReality">Cannot Tell Fiction from Reality</a> whatsoever, and thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear. Not only is this proving annoying, but he's taking Andy's clear love for him for granted. Buzz, on the other hand, isn't entirely in the wrong, as he's not doing so intentionally, and Woody ends up going overboard with his immense jealously to the point that the other toys turn on him after he knocks Buzz out the window. When the two have a heartfelt conversation, Buzz, after having spent a good chunk of the movie depressed upon discovering the truth of him being a toy, acknowledges that being a toy is far more important, as he has the love of a child. Woody, meanwhile, realizes he went too far with his jealousy, and part of loving Andy is to allow him to have room for other favorites in his life. Thus, an iconic friendship is born.

When Woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector named Al to be sold to a toy museum in Japan, he's dead set on getting back to Andy, but Pete reminds him that Andy isn't going to be around forever. Sooner or later, Andy is going to grow up and move on with his life, and Woody may no longer be a part of it. Woody, however, initially spends much of his time insisting Andy is a loving and caring owner who cherishes his toys. Part way through the film, Woody comes to agree with Prospector's viewpoint, worried Andy may no longer play with him if his arm rips again, leaving him to initially want to go the museum. It's only when he sees a boy who looks an awful lot like Andy on tv that he acknowledges Prospector is still valid in his reasoning that Woody won't be able to stop Andy from growing up, but he holds stedfast to his belief that he needs to be there for his kid. Unfortunately, this is where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prospector shows his true colors, revealing he thinks children destroy toys, and that all of them will be thrown out and left to rot</span>.

He then chastises them for doing so, calling them selfish for putting their needs before their kid's, and decides to leave them while he goes back to Andy. The other toys think he's crazy, as Andy has already grown up and is no longer playing with them. On the one hand, the toys are right in that Andy is not going to be playing with them anymore, especially since he's off to college, and they need to move on with their lives so they can fulfill their purpose of being played with, thereby ensuring their own happiness. However, Woody is right they are being selfish, as Andy was trying to take care of them by putting them in the attic; it's just his carelessness led them to being thrown out and them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">not believing a word Woody says</a> when he has no reason to lie to them shows they've moved on a little too quickly from Andy.

Save for Koba (who even early on has good points), both the humans and apes are just trying to survive. The humans want to rebuild civilization while the apes want to thrive in theirs and neither really want a war. Neither have much reason to trust the other side either and have all rights to make efforts to protect themselves.

<ul><li> Tony believes that the Avengers need to be accountable for their actions, while Steve believes that the heroes themselves are the best ones to make judgement calls. Their experiences in previous films both lend credence to their points of view:
<ul><li> Tony's cavalier attitude towards his tech has led to horrible consequences, while Steve has encountered corrupt and incompetent government officials who've made situations worse.
</li><li> What it comes down to is that while the heroes <em>might</em> not be the best ones to make a judgement call, how can they be sure that anyone they hand the responsibility to would be better?
</li></ul></li><li> On a more personal level, they make several questionable decisions in how they handle the conflict. They <em>do</em>, however, raise several valid points. From Iron Man:
<ul><li> He's hounded by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">captured Anti-Accord team for arresting them and sending them to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Hellhole Prison</a>. While they are indeed given very dubious treatment, Stark points out that he was just doing his duty (as he is under a lot of government pressure), and that the Anti-Accord side should have known what they risked when they aided a known felon</span>.
</li><li> Likewise, Cap tears into Tony for keeping Wanda under what is essentially house arrest without even telling her, and while Tony's motivations and right to make that call are left dubious, he is right when he says Wanda <em>really</em> isn't safe among the masses right now.
</li><li> Lastly, while Tony could be seen as irresponsible in bringing Spider-Man, who's still an inexperienced teenager, into the conflict, his orders were for Peter to keep his distance and just web up opponents without becoming involved, which Peter promptly ignores. His first scene even depicts him being guilt-shamed by the mother of a Sokovian victim and he presents this to the Avengers as why he thinks they, himself included, need to be kept in check. Tony doesn't start acting irrational until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Zemo's</a> schemes ruin any chance of reconciliation between the two sides.
</li><li> At the climax, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tony is completely right that Bucky killed Tony's parents and Steve at least suspected it. Steve tells the truth when questioned and later apologizes to Tony for lying.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> From Captain America:
<ul><li> He seemingly takes the accusations of collateral damage very lightly, but he <em>does</em> make a valid point saying things would be much, <em>much</em> worse if the Avengers didn't do anything at all (specifically, the human race would've been conquered by Thanos or HYDRA, or driven extinct by Ultron, either of which is overwhelmingly worse than the collateral damage caused by the Avengers in stopping these from happening).
</li><li> While he may be borderline unreasonable in his desire not to sign the accords (it should be noted that Steve was willing to compromise up until he heard about the situation with Wanda's house arrest), he points out those agreements would turn the Avengers into a bunch of glorified attack dogs, which would only allow him to help people selectively<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mtdp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mtdp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mtdp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the UN, being a politically driven government body, renders the very likely possibility that any regulation of the Avengers' activities could and possibly would be used to forward a political agenda rather than help people, which is the Avengers' primary focus and the main reason they were formed in the first place</span>, to say nothing of how easily groups like HYDRA or other villains (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as the villain of this very movie</span>) have repeatedly been able to insert themselves into government groups like this in the past.
</li><li> Additionally, the way the government officials act throughout the film (sending a team after Bucky, who's only a suspect based on circumstantial evidence, with shoot-to-kill orders, refusing to adhere to Steve, Sam, and Bucky's right to legal representation after they're brought in, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refusing to release the captured Team Cap members and go after Zemo when it's definitively proven he was responsible for the bombing</span>) shows that putting them in control of the Avengers would not be the best idea.
</li><li> He also gets a lot of flak for dragging all the other Anti-Accord heroes in his quest to help Bucky, disregarding the fact that each and every one of them made the decision to help Cap themselves, with several of them having their own personal motivations for assisting Cap.
</li><li> When it comes to the climax, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while Steve does admit that he does selfishly want to protect Bucky, he also is correct that Bucky was brainwashed into killing the Starks.

While Mace is right to be wary of Anakin's capabilities, Anakin's reasons for being so distrustful of the council in spite of this gesture were pretty well founded.

Viserys I declares his daughter from his first marriage, Rhaneyra, as heir. However he continues proclaiming her heir despite having sons from his second marriage. When he dies Rhaenyra and her half-brother Aegon II fight for supremacy. They both have valid points. Viserys proclaimed Rhaenyra his heir and she is older then Aegon. On the other hand, proclaiming a daughter over a son goes completely against the succession laws most of Westeros works on. This is even more strict among the Kings, Viserys only becoming heir to the throne due to his female cousin Rhaenys being passed over (he's the son of the second son, while Rhaenys was daughter of the first son of King Jaehaerys I), a law which was decided upon in the Great Council of the Lords. It doesn't help that Rhaenyra is married to her uncle, the ruthless and amoral Daemon Targaryen, who doesn't at all look like someone who should hold power. However, both claimants show themselves to be poor and brutal rulers, and refuse to compromise: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Rhaneyra takes King's Landing she refuses the offer to call another Great Council to determine succession,</span> along with both branches of the family murdering other members, Aegon's full brother Aemond murdering one of Rhanyra's sons Lucerys Velaryon, and Daemon avenging his stepsons murder by sending men to murder one of Aegon's infant sons.

Anne Elliot was persuaded not to marry young Captain Fredrick Wentworth by her godmother Lady Russell.

So they put the prison in lockdown mode and refuse to let anyone in to talk to or even see Eve. Clint also correctly fears that there might be men out there in Dooling who want to kill Eve because they hope it will wake up all the women or simply because they want a scapegoat when she proves unable to wake up their sleeping loved ones. On the other hand, you can't entirely blame their opponents, who want to get their hands on Eve, either. The men of Dooling are desperate to find a cure for their loved ones and believe Eve to be the key to finding one (which is technically true, though not in the way they think since Eve can't end Aurora entirely by herself). Their leader, Frank Geary, is correct about the fact that Norcross has no authority to put the prison in lockdown, and is at first willing to let Judge Silver bring in a professional negotiator to try and resolve the conflict peacefully. And of course, Norcross refusal to let anyone near Eve only makes him look suspicious. Eve only makes it worse by outright telling Frank he has to kill her.

They are both right, and the leader of the UN forces (Mohammed Vance) is portrayed as a ruthless but honorable man who honestly regrets the killing that he has and will order.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWyndham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWyndham">John Wyndham</a> <em>tries</em> to present this in the novella "Consider Her Ways" by asking the question, "Would women be better off if there were no men?" Two characters argue over this, with neither presented as being irrational or clearly wrong. The male-less society shown actually does seem pretty awful, thus implying the pro-men character is correct. However, her argument is that it's terrible that there's no romantic love any more, rather than pointing out that the post-gendercide society is a repressive caste-based dictatorship.

However, Holt, also a black man, tells Terry to let it go. Terry wants to file the complaint not only because he wants justice, but also because he doesn't want the officer who arrested him to get away with it and could potentially go on to do it again. Holt advises Terry to let it go because it could be seen as "rocking the boat," and could seriously harm Terry's ability to advance his career and that he may be better off in the long run by getting into a position of power so he can address the systemic racism within the NYPD in a more profound way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, Terry goes ahead and files the complaint.

Amy convinces her to not take the case and to press charges against her boss, something that Rosa disagrees with. Amy's argument is that no one should be allowed to get away with committing a crime just because they have a lot of money, and that when women come forward with their stories, it empowers more women to do so. Rosa's argument is that because they have no physical evidence that the assault took place, and that a Jury is unlikely to believe her; the victim may very well end up losing the money, losing her job, losing her reputation, and may even be blacklisted from ever getting a job in finance ever again.

She finds out that hes gay. She doesnt care but given that its set in 1960, it has to be kept a secret. In the finale when shes getting ready to open for him in front of a black audience (Shy is black as well) in Harlem, her opening acts manager yells at her and tells her shes gonna bomb because a white girl doesnt have anything in common with them. It spooks her and Shys manager, Reggie, tells her that Shy is what she and the audience have in common and tells her to talk about him and so she does. She starts making jokes about him being a diva and high maintenance that Reggie and Shy take to mean that shes outing him. She genuinely didnt mean it that way and the audience didnt take it that way. The straw that broke the camels back was saying that he had Judy Garland shoes. Talking about Garland back in the day was a code for being gay. She doesnt know this but the two of them do. Once again, the audience didnt seem to understand it. Reggie meets her on the Tarmac when theyre supposed to be getting on a plane to Europe and fires her. On one hand, she was told to make jokes about him and it was an honest misunderstanding but on the other hand, he trusted her with his secret, she used a specific code word.

Their experiments finally conclude with both parties proving correct; the infant changeling only starts making an effort when Mora uses his shock methods (albeit in a much more controlled and moderated way than he did with Odo), but because Odo had been trying to emotionally connect with it, the infant clearly recognizes Odo as a friend, where Odo had come to resent Mora. This is most evident in their first unprompted shapeshifting; where Odo's had been to form a tentacle to slap Mora away from the control console, the infant tries to imitate Odo's face. In essence, the infant's first attempt to communicate was it trying to say "Hello", where Odo's was more akin to "Stop it".

The Technocratic Union wants a stable and democratic reality where everyone is able to create miracles through technology. They have largely succeeded: the modern world with computers, airplanes and modern medicine exists by their design. Their opponents, the Traditions, prefer a more unstable (ahem, dynamic) reality with more personal freedom - a freedom of expression that includes rewriting reality itself rather then merely writing words. (The original version had this same conflict of interest, but hardcoded that the Technocracy's ideals made them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Dirty Communists</a>.) Taken a step further in <em>The Sorcerer's Crusade</em>; in the Dark Ages, when everyone believed in magic, the Traditions (especially the Order of Hermes) were in control and maintaining the stability of the world while the upstart Order of Reason wanted to overturn this consensus reality for the good of everyone.

The traditions essentially advocate the "magic is superior/new things are bad" viewpoint, backed up mechanically by new human technologies draining the power from old spells. The free council thinks new stuff is great, drawing power from new concepts and even technology in crafting rote spells. The primary antagonist faction was changed into decadent god-priests obsessed with controlling the destiny of mages and mortals specifically to avoid this trope, though many complained that it weakened the setting by bringing up the trope in a new way: that's pretty much what the traditions want, too.

They follow Ulfric Stormcloak, a man of great courage and loyalty to his allies (which his enemies acknowledge) and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">a paragon</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">traditional</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Nord</a> values. They (justifiably) feel that the Empire caved-in to end the Great War (in which thousands of Nords gave their lives fighting <em>for</em> the Empire), and that it's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">decrepit</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">obstructive</a> entity with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">weak leadership</a> that has given their enemies huge amounts of power in Skyrim without the Nords' consent. Also, a few characters mention that the Empire has been putting high taxes on Skyrim after the war, limiting the citizens' financial well-being.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> is trying to hold onto Skyrim because it needs both the resources and the manpower, especially since they expect a full-scale second "Great War" with the Aldmeri Dominion (see below) in the near future. Even many Nords continue to support the Empire, realizing that united Skyrim <em>backing</em> the Empire has the best chance to defeat the Dominion in the inevitable second Great War. Despite their success in retaking the Imperial City during the Great War, it came at great cost and the leadership of the Empire realized that agreeing to the White-Gold Concordat would buy them some much-needed time to recover. They also don't really bother to even enforce some of the more-hated terms of the Concordat, such as the ban on Talos worship. Additionally, Skyrim has historically been one of the Empire's (which was <em>founded by</em> Talos) greatest supporters, and that the all-important Nord honor demands that they support their long-time ally. They (rightfully) believe that Ulfric and the Stormcloaks are putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, and that their rebellion is extremely short-sighted. (Both sides agree that the Dominion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">irredeemably evil</a>, with open intentions of dominating and oppressing the world in any way they can.) Further, Ulfric and the Stormcloacks have displayed significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastically Racist</a> tendencies and Ulfric himself used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">traditional Nordic challenge</a> as an excuse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">effortlessly kill</a> the previous King of Skyrim (albeit with the victim accepting his challenge), despite said King having been known to <em>support</em> Ulfric's views up until being challenged. Also, some characters reveal that the unity of the Empire allows for prosperous trade and surplus of food, and Skyrim's independence will damage this trade.
</li><li> Behind it all lies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a>, led by the extremist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>, who are pulling the strings behind the scenes and may have even been responsible for <em>instigating</em> the civil war. They hope to weaken the Empire by depriving it of its strongest remaining province while bleeding both sides dry for an eventual Dominion takeover. There is even evidence that they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tortured and brainwashed Ulfric Stormcloak as a prisoner in the waning days of the Great War and then unleashed him to accomplish exactly this task. (However, they may have underestimated Ulfric's leadership and inspirational abilities, as he quickly proved to be more effective than intended...)</span> Both sides of the civil war agree that the Dominion is the greater threat, but are at odds over the best way to deal with them.
</li></ul></li><li> It even branches off into the main quest. The Blades don't like the Greybeards because they'd rather the Dragonborn focus on learning to control their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Thu'um</a>, and because they refuse to intervene in Tamriel's ongoing crises. Conversely, the Greybeards don't like the Blades because they constantly meddle in affairs they don't understand, and wish to use the Dragonborn as a soldier. Of course, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Alduin</a> has emerged, and threatens Tamriel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">destruction</a>, the Dragonborn doesn't have time to meditate on the voice, but to simply charge in with blades drawn is a fool's venture.

Inside <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ludo Kressh's tomb</span> the player is faced with a series of illusions. In one of these, the player's companions are about to attack Kreia (the player's mentor) and the player must decide who to side with. However, if the player answers "I won't attack you, but I won't stop the others from attacking you either", Kreia exasperatedly scolds you and everyone present tells you that "apathy is death".

The Guardians are divinely inspired/powered heroes seeking to rid the world of the Defiants whose technology is destroying the only thing keeping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">dragons</a> from causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>. The Defiants are persecuted "lesser" races who have dealt with the Guardians bearing down on them for generations, and who can only defend themselves with said technology. Both sides are right, and both sides are at fault: the Guardian intro makes it clear that the Defiants are, actually, at fault for unleashing Regulos and the dragons; however they go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">way too far in their persecution</a> and drive some members of the Defiants to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> in the first place, and neither side can stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">killing the other one</a> all the way through the far-future Defiant intro to realize they shouldn't be enemies, even as the world literally dies around them and Regulos gets his way. The character of either side ends up in the "middle ground" timeline of the main game (either because of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> for years, or through actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>) at which point they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">immediately go about killing the other side instead of actually dealing with the Dragons</a> for most of the early areas.

Given the Horde has mitigating circumstances for many of their past crimes and has helped save the world, both sides have degenerated to a "he did this, she did that" situation to justify the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">cycle of hatred.</a>
</li><li> Interestingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> gives credence to both sides in the torn friendship between its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonists</a>.

The Regime choose to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>, doing things like abandoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> and deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> ala the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice Lords</a>, but do end up improving the world with their actions. The Insurgents meanwhile fight the Regime even before they start becoming morally dodgy, motivated more by Batman's fears of what could happen rather than actual concerning behavior and it gets pointed out to Bats that keeping to traditional superhero methods completely has become impractical at best. But Batman winds up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> because the majority of the Justice League wind up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> and becoming much worse.

The original King Thordan and his knights launched an unprovoked attack on the great wyrm Ratatoskr, killing her and consuming her eyes for the immense amount of aether they contained. Her brood brother Nidhogg, was absolutely enraged by such treachery and launched a thousand year long campaign against Ishgard as a result. On the one hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Archbishop Thordan VII</a> mentions that what Thordan I did was absolutely unforgivable, and Nidhogg's rage at his sister's undeserved death is entirely understandable. On the other hand, he's also completely right to point out that the people of Ishgard's present don't deserve to suffer for the crimes of their ancestors, and that Nidhogg is so consumed by his need for vengeance that instead of just wiping out Ishgard like he could have at any point in the past millennium, he just drags out a bloody conflict that ruins the lives of countless innocent people and dragons. In order for things to truly improve for Ishgard, both sides need to be permanently dealt with.

Over the course of the story, they're both vindicated. There are moments when Susie attacking everyone makes matters worse, and since most enemies can be spared peacefully, there's really no reason for it.

For example, the first such sidequest makes you choose between returning a water-producing magic gemstone to its pedestal so that it can continue to provide much-needed water to the people of the desert, or giving it to the nearby university for the purposes of researching a new kind of energy that can potentially benefit the entire world.

The problem isn't that either of them are wrong, in fact they both raise entirely salient points, the problem is you're the one who has to pick a side and there's no happy medium.

Rie is unwilling to suspect any of her friends, least of all her best friend Runa, whereas Taiko believes that unless the group is willing to do just that, they won't find out who the killer is. On the one hand, Taiko is correct <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the ten guests is a murderer</span>. On the other hand, Rie is right about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Runa being innocent</span>, not to mention how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taiko jumping to conclusions and suspecting that Kamen is guilty after Taiko's best friend Kotoba is killed/badly burned</span> suggests that the two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> when it comes to being irrational about their friends.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The PTA Disbands" when Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel are trying to convince the parents at a PTA meeting of their respective positions. Mrs. Krabappel argues that Skinner's budget cuts are harming the education the parents' children are receiving, and that they need the resources to do their job. The parents are inclined to agree with her until Skinner points out that the school is on a very tight budget as it is, and for the school administration to get what the teachers are asking for they'd have to raise the parents' taxes. That gets the parents complaining about taxes being high enough as it is, and the debate between Skinner's and Krabappel's positions ends up going back and forth. The episode ends by Skinner and Krabappel deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and rent out the school's cloakrooms to the prison system to raise extra money, although the writers don't provide an answer to the taxes vs. education quality debate.
</li><li> "The Cartridge Family" does this with the gun ownership debate. On the one side we have Marge, who doesn't want the Simpsons to own a gun because of how dangerous they can be; on the other we have the NRA, who argue that there are valid reasons to own one, like hunting and protecting one's family. However, the point they both agree upon is that guns are deadly weapons that should only be handled by responsible owners; Homer demonstrates an <strong>insanely</strong> flagrant disregard for even the most basic forms of gun safety, which drives Marge away and gets him kicked out of the NRA. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the writers themselves were very divided on the issue of guns and couldn't decide on one aesop to teach, so they just showed both sides of the argument and basically ended on "people like Homer shouldn't have guns".
</li><li> "Itchy and Scratchy and Marge" very notably doesn't take a side on the issue of whether censorship is good or bad (but it does have the moral of "Be prepared for consequences, hypocrisy, and opposing viewpoints if you choose to stand up for a cause."). Sure, Roger Meyers is a scumbag who doesn't care if his shows influence kids to hurt themselves and others, but he's just a man trying to entertain others. Sure, SNUH is a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> who want to censor even masterpieces for offending their conservative housewife sensibilities, but they're kind of right in that kids should be exposed to real art and not just pop culture trash.
</li><li> In "Mobile Homer", Marge begins obsessively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingCorners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingCorners">Cutting Corners</a> to save money after Homer is denied life insurance to the point of of making her family live in poverty. Homer confronts her for not being adventurous and controlling the money he worked to earn, but Marge retorts that Homer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek">barely does his job</a> and spends more money than he makes, while she is the one who pays the bills and balances the books. Homer eventually spends all of Marge's nest egg on an RV out of pure spite, resulting in a bitter feud that nearly destroys their marriage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy">Golden Mean Fallacy</a> a lot to find a middle ground between two opposing sides, ultimately arguing that each side is partially correct, making it all the funnier when this attitude is subverted, such as the NAMBLA episode which has the leader of NAMBLA making a long-winded speech about what is wrong and right followed by a short retort from Kyle and Stan which undoes the speech entirely.
</li><li> The animated TV adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax">The Lorax</a></em> does acknowledge not just the Lorax's environmental concerns with the devastation of the forest caused by the Once-ler, but also that a lot of people would lose their jobs if the Thneed factory shut down, showing at least one necessary point to the Once-ler's plans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em>: After completing his last Quailman comic, Doug is caught doodling and making fun of Lamar Bone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">who really had it coming</a>. Doug knows Bone didn't get his word on his work, and he simply traps Bone by asking if he was immune to the rules he enforces. Bone explains that he wasn't, cue this trope and the deal Bone makes with the students <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> adding a rule that bans Saturday detentions</span>. Bone doesn't like to be made fun of, but his actions can also get him in trouble.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>: This occurs in the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OperationZERO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OperationZERO">Operation: Z.E.R.O.</a></em>. While Numbah 362 admits that Numbah 1 was right to prioritize the Museum before their Moonbase and for believing in Numbah 0, Numbah 1 admits that she was right too-namely that he was putting himself before his team without whom he couldn't have pulled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> does like to provide this a fair amount of times, arguably preferring to teach kids friendship is about compromise and respect on both ends to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">previous unfriendly aesops</a>. "Lesson Zero", "Over a Barrel" and "Sisterhooves Social" are prime cases both sides admit the other has valid arguments and end up taking a middle road.
</li><li> Although the Project Cadmus arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> does arguably swing a little more towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">Villain Has a Point</a>, due to the fact Cadmus undertakes much dodgier things than the Justice League, the show's creators and the majority of viewers agree that this trope applies. Even the Justice League admits that Cadmus does have a point that the League could potentially be hugely dangerous to the people of Earth. On the other hand, the Justice League is also right that <em>Cadmus itself</em> is equally dangerous in potentia, what with the black operations to steal from the Watchtower, the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a>, etcetera.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Book 4 villainess Kuvira refuses to give control of the Earth Kingdom (Renamed as the Earth Empire) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> Prince Wu because he'd end up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a> beholden to foreign powers. While her detractors see her logic, they're not going to forget that Kuvira 'united' the Earth Kingdom through oppression and force any time soon.
<ul><li> Prince Wu proceeds to prove <em>both</em> sides wrong by immediately abdicating and splitting the Earth Kingdom into multiple democratic states.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: The series doesn't go into too much depth on the politics of the Wars, but they do go into more than the films did. The Republic has a point in that the Separatists act like violent thugs most of the time, and announced their defection by trying to conquer the Republic, not to mention being led by an actual Sith Lord. The Separatists, on the other hand, are right in that the Republic really is horrifically corrupt and in the thrall of the galactic corporations, and provide little aid to member planets. This, of course, serves Palpatine's purposes perfectly: no matter which side wins, he can paint them as the heroes and reformat them into the Empire with himself at the head.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Boss Mabel", Stan and Mabel get into an argument on how to run the Mystery Shack. Mabel takes umbrage to Stan's miserly and obnoxious attitude, but Stan believes if you're too nice, people will walk over you. At the end, both are proven correct; Mabel needs to get tough to get any work out of Soos and Wendy, and her liberal refunds policy eats at the Shack's profits. Stan, meanwhile, goes onto a gameshow and loses an easy fortune because he can't be bothered to learn basic manners.
</li><li> In "A Tale of Two Stans", the ongoing feud between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stan and Ford</span> stems from the last major argument they had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thirty years ago: Ford had discovered that his scientific research had given Bill Cipher a means of conquering our reality, and wanted Stan's help in hiding his journals; Stan had spent the last few years estranged from the family, either imprisoned or homeless, and was upset to discover that Ford only wanted him back in his life to help him hide the journals<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yn6q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yn6q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yn6q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which would also have necessitated never seeing each other again, which hurt Stan even more</span>. As necessary as hiding the research was, Ford's ego and obsessive focus on the big picture really blew up in his face; the disagreement ultimately led to him getting shoved into the very dimensional portal he was trying to shut down, and in a desperate attempt to save him, Stan spent the next three decades trying to restart the portal. In the present, Ford wants to keep the world safe and believes that Stan shouldn't have risked using the portal just to save him; Stan believes that saving his family was worth anything.</span> Both have a point, and both of them refuse to budge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>, the Turtles get into an argument over how to deal with Leatherhead; Mikey thinks he deserves their sympathy, but the others don't want him in their lair as he's prone to violent rages. Splinter compromises; Leatherhead should be shown compassion, but he should also be kept chained up so his rages won't hurt anyone. "I'm compassionate, not insane."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Peridot and Pearl get in an argument over who's the better engineer while trying to design a drill. Peridot brings up the fact that gems live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a> and that she was made to be a builder while Pearl is a servant. Pearl insists that her origins make her no less skilled, and that her knowledge of Earth actually gives her seniority. By the end of their competition it's made clear that the two are equally skilled.
<ul><li> Later on, Connie gets angry with Steven for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> giving himself up to Homeworld to save her and some other humans from being taken to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo">People Zoo</a></span>. She's mainly angry because he left her alone to deal with it himself, thinking that he didn't believe in all their training for situations like this, and then returned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">and acted like it was nothing and that she should be glad he was back</a>. However, while she has a right to be angry, Steven's actions were justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one of the Gems who came to take them away used technology powerful enough to stop <em>Alexandrite</em>, and Steven felt that they were outmatched and that the only way to save everyone was to give himself up in exchange for their freedom. He also felt like he should take all the blame because he was partly responsible for their arrival in the first place</span>. Eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">he realises he was acting like a jerk</a> to Connie the day after he came back, but it takes her a while to forgive him.

Double D lashes out at Eddy for his irresponsibility, pride and never listening to him. Eddy fires back at Double D, however, pointing out that for all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">supposed moral high ground</a>, he still goes along with Eddy's schemes even against his better judgement and he's the one who built the machine that triggered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> that got them chased out of the cul-de-sac in the first place, to which Double D disputes that they wouldn't have been chased out of town had Eddy bothered to pay attention to him when he warned Eddy against pushing the red button that caused the whole scam to go haywire.
</li><li> As much as it's very clear the titular Zee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em> genuinely does have a heart from how he adamantly insists on helping anyone in trouble and never killing, The NSA's fear that he was simply reprogrammed to think he has a heart as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> ploy by terrorists holds real value as well, considering he went rogue during a deep cover operation with the Brother's Day terrorist group. This is thoroughly explored in the two-part episode <em>Wired</em> where Zee and Bennett discuss the very nature of it, and even Zee is left frightened at the possibility that Bennett might actually be right when they find an unidentifiable device inside his head that isn't in his schematic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed to be a literal conscience module installed by his eccentric creator</span>.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, a lot of arguments arise between Dinobot and the rest of the Maximals over how to accomplish missions or deal with threats, and generally how to do things. Dinobot being a Predacon soldier always favors brutal, swift aggression, lethal force, and focusing entirely on the war, while the rest being Maximal explorers tend to favor brains over brawn, non-lethal force, and making time for actual exploration and even having fun. Rather than taking a "right or wrong" approach it usually boils down to them showing Dinobot that the Maximal's ways are <em>effective</em> rather than superior, and even then the Maximals often acknowledge that Dinobot's plans would have worked better in the end. Though there are times Dinobot is shown as being explicitly wrong, other times arise where the Maximal's plan fails miserably and they begrudgingly fall back onto Dinobot's plan instead.

Giving all sides of an issue equal weight can be flawed however, especially when such a position ignores their respective levels of support and/or factual accuracy.
</li><li> Political power can and frequently does swing back and forth between different parties in democratic countries, as voters decide they like one party's policies at one time and then decide to switch to another party's policies later on, largely due to this trope. Sometimes parties who win elections and form governments end up plagiarizing parts of their opponents' platforms in order to broaden their own appeal in the electorate.
