</p><p>A mainstay of the classic teen comedy movie, but usually seen at least once in every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">sitcom</a> that has a teenaged character, this is the inevitable result of mixing one or more teenagers with a house devoid of parental figures, who are usually away for the weekend. It almost always results in wall-to-wall teens, loud music, underage drinking, and property damage. (And, in R-rated movies, a lot of sex in the bedrooms and/or bathrooms.) Sometimes this is by design, and sometimes a small party for a couple of friends spirals completely out of control.
</p><p>A popular variation of this is that the host only invited over two or three friends and the party just shows up out of nowhere. Someone they did invite brought one more person, and so did another. Then someone they never met shows up at the door. Fast forward ten minutes and a college football team shows up with a keg and there's somehow full disco lighting in the living room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">The host will still get in trouble for this</a>, and the show may still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">play it as an Aesop.</a> Another variation is when two teens live in the same house, and one plans a party without consulting the other, who has to study for a test or do something else where peace and quiet is necessary. The second teen usually will not find out until they come home to see the party already underway.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The Wild Teen Party usually experiences at least one, and often more, of the following complications:
</p><ul><li> They are treated as a fundamental experience of teenhood, and therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.
</li><li> There will be bumping and grinding (nothing like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance">High-School Dance</a>).
</li><li> The parents call home in the middle of the party "to check on things". The teen hosts must then either quiet the crowd down for the duration of the call, or come up with a believable explanation for the noise in the background. Even if the teens succeed in pulling off a perfect deception, the parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">may still become uneasy</a> and cut short their time away from home.
</li><li> Party crashers of various stripes. If it's not the varsity football team and their entourage descending on a party to which they weren't invited, it'll be punks or bikers running wild, trashing the place and carrying off cheerleaders.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Stupid — and potentially lethal — stunts fueled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">the excessive consumption of beer and other alcoholic beverages.</a>
</li><li> A fistfight, which sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingBrawl">escalates</a> into a full brawl. If there's a picture window, someone will almost certainly go through it.
</li><li> A rare family keepsake like an urn, or better yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes">one containing Grandma's ashes,</a> will be stolen, destroyed, or used to mix cocktails.
</li><li> A fire, flood or other disaster.
</li><li> If the party is wild enough, the police will show up to shut it down — usually just minutes before the parents return.
</li><li> If the party is even wilder than that, a film crew will come to tape it for a TV special.
</li><li> A character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsRaidingTheWineCabinet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsRaidingTheWineCabinet">gets incredibly drunk</a> with bad results. Usually a character who doesn't normally drink, but is pressured into it/doesn't realize the drinks are spiked, to give the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">more impact</a>.
</li><li> The most generic and repetitive "party/dance music" imaginable.
</li><li> Literally <em>everybody</em> dancing and having a blast. As anybody who's actually been to a real teen (or, for that matter, adult) party will tell you, this part is certainly not how real parties hold out. Usually, there are at least as many people calmly sitting around and talking (or standing alone and feeling left out) as there are people dancing and acting crazy. Also, the house could not possibly have enough room for everyone to dance and act crazy at once. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Oh,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DarwinAwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DarwinAwards">wait...</a>
</li><li> It devolves into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy">A Party, Also Known as an Orgy</a>.
</li><li> In particularly dark works, someone might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Raped</a>, often (though not always) under the influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker">alcohol</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">date-rape drugs</a>. Bonus points if the victim is a virgin who never <em>normally</em> parties much (or at all)...or (conversely) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePortrayedAsRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePortrayedAsRedemption">in a setting where that's frowned upon</a>.
</li><li> Characters may use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">drugs</a>. This could be marijuana, LSD, cocaine, MDMA, or one of the new "designer" drugs, depending on where and when the story takes place. If the work is <em>really</em> dark, something bad happens (an overdose, the drug is contaminated, the above-mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Rape</a>, etc.)
</li><li> Pictures or videos make their way onto the Internet, and cause lots of problems for the subjects.
</li></ul><p>The party then ends in either of two different ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> It peters out by the next morning, leaving the house (and sometimes the yard) looking like a war zone, populated by unconscious (and sometimes insufficiently-clothed) teens. The hosts must then somehow clean up and repair damages before the parentals return and have them all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundedForever">Grounded Forever</a>. This may require finding one or more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a>, depending on the level of destruction.
</li></ul>Or
<ul><li> The parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise">come home unexpectedly</a> while the party is in full swing. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordNeedleScratch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordNeedleScratch">Record Needle Scratch</a> and a lot of yelling, speaking in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angrish">Angrish</a> and (in some cases) dropping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">F-bombs</a>, the crowd (mostly) disperses, leaving behind the unconscious, the belligerent, and the teen hosts, who then get reamed out by their parents and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundedForever">Grounded Forever</a>.
</li></ul><p>However it runs, with whatever complications and ending, the Wild Teen Party usually ends in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about responsibility, maturity, and — if the hosts were caught — telling the truth to one's parents.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb">Youth Is Wasted on the Dumb</a> (which may occur at this), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">Teens Are Monsters</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy">A Party, Also Known as an Orgy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight">What Did I Do Last Night?</a>. Take note that it doesn't necessarily have to deal with teenagers, but they are the most common occurrences of the trope. The subject of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnTheWildSideEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnTheWildSideEpisode">"Walk on the Wild Side" Episode</a> will sometimes throw one of these.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, of course (except for the aforementioned complications of literally everyone dancing and trashing) — as any news reporter who wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">take a pop at Facebook</a> will tell you. Moreover, "teen partying" is now listed as a reason for certain movies getting the ratings they have.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dydOm225374">A commercial for Sabra Hummus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> broadcast in late 2009 plays with this trope. A couple share some hummus on their patio while watching a sunset, and comment on how it's just like they're on a Mediterranean vacation. A moment later a bowling ball crashes through the French doors behind them, and they discover a Wild Teen Party has broken out because their son thought they were "on a Mediterranean vacation".
</li><li> In a Canadian tire commercial, a teenager, cleaning up the mess after one of these, says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">It was a get-together!</a>" The scene cuts to exterior shot of the house. Loud music, strobe lights playing on windows, couch sitting on lawn, dog barking in the background, kids yelling and laughing, sound of glass shattering, etc.
</li><li> An implied instance of the trope occurred in the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScj7MwjHBs">commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a></em> game: Some cops stop by a house due to reports of disruptive behavior in the neighborhood. They then ask for Mario, who then reveals himself. It then cuts after showing some gameplay footage to the cops escorting Mario to their squadcar by the arms, with his legs flailing and his protesting "But it'sa me, Mario!" before the cops sarcastically dismiss his protests with, "Yeah, tell it to the judge," strongly implying that he was going to end up arrested for the disruptive party.
</li><li> There's a feline equivalent in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b9hJxr17Ow">this ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Tidy Cats cat litter.
</li><li> A French commercial for the national electricity company showed parents receiving a letter from the company offering them to adapt their bill to their needs, interleaved with shots of the teenage children throwing wild parties in the house. The commercial ended with the parents asking their children if they did not stay too late at night with the lights on while they were away, with the (obviously hungover) children answering that they certainly did not.
</li><li> This UK <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAtekyBQsFY">Yellow Pages commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has teenagers cleaning up after a party before the parents return, and having to get a scratched table fixed.

Beer is mentioned, but never seen, as all the party goers have generic plastic cups that could, theoretically, hold gatorade or soda.

Liquor and sex become prevalent in both parties, as one of the boys spikes the Kool-Aid at the first party with some alcohol that was found stashed away in a camp counselor's locker. However, at the first party there was a murder, as Mr. Warren, who was temporarily brought out of lockup to be taunted by the teenagers, ended up being accidentally killed by Stanley Runk with his knife.

It's played with; the party was originally, as Giles planned it, just going to be a quiet affair to welcome Buffy home, but her friends overrule him and turn it in to one of these; ostensibly because they think it's going to be more fun, but <em>actually</em> because there's all sorts of tensions surround why Buffy left which, now she's back, they're all avoiding dealing with — having the huge party is just an excuse to avoid her as much as possible while 'welcoming' her back. Needless to say, it gets ugly even <em>before</em> the zombies show up.

</li><li> The season four episode "Spell" has another wild party (though this one was Lois's fault - it was a surprise party for Chloe's birthday), and again Clark's parents find evidence of it happening.

All up, it might be more accurate to describe this example more of a Moderately Engaging Teen Party rather than a Wild one.

Unfortunately, the party is crashed by a bunch of guys who turn the garage into a meth lab.
<ul><li> Subverted on <em>Home Alone 4,</em> where Francis tells his three hoodlum friends not to have a party at his house. They keep their promise, but still trash the house because the trio is so violent and destructive that they have the energy to trash the house in the same manner as a Wild Teen Party.

<div class="indent"> Parents are conditioned to expect a few minor mishaps when they go on vacation: a chipped dish, some spilled milk on the rug — (<em>long pause</em>) There was a <em>kangaroo</em> in my <em>living room</em>.
</div><ul><li> It should be noted that this went a <em>bit</em> beyond an unsupervised party: Mallory had crashed their parents' car, so to pay for the repairs they turned the house into a <em>bed and breakfast</em>.

She threw a Halloween party to try and get her friends into the spirit of the holiday, and used real ghouls. More ghouls showed up and trashed the party and Roxie started a thing with Frankenstein. Naturally her aunts got home. Sabrina threw another Halloween party earlier in the second season but her aunts were home and she was busy trying to cover up the magical termites and the talking furniture.

Only Lizzie, Miranda and Gordo show up. Lizzie calls her mother to get rid of the out of control partyers.

Lorena happens to have a popular guy over that night however so they tell all the girls in school and the wild party ensues. Things get pretty crazy with toilet paper being thrown around the house and the father's antique crystal plate getting smashed. They clean up before the parents get home, but end up confessing. Larry's narration says that they keep on confessing to other things they'd been hiding and the parents are so stunned by all this that they just ground the kids for three weeks and call it even.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SClub7">S Club 7</a></em> managed to pull this off when they were house sitting.

When Screech's parents are away for the weekend, the boys have a small party with just themselves in his house. The girls crash and Violet accidentally breaks Screech's mother's statue of Elvis.

In the middle of things, Brad goes out to the backyard fence to get advice from Wilson, and that's when Tim and Jill walk in on the whole thing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a>,</em> after Eddie invites a friend over while Carl and Harriet are away, a party erupts.

There is mention of Jello in the bathtub, and Carl finds Urkel stuffed in the couch.
</li><li> Jenny's birthday party-turned-rager in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>. Pictures are tilted, Lily van der Woodsen's clothes are worn by complete strangers, people try to have sex in the van der Woodsens' bedrooms. Not to mention Vanya (the van der Woodsens' doorman) has to fight back complete strangers from coming into the van der Woodsens' building and the police have to bring Rufus and Lily back to said building to stop the rager. The party initially started out as a quiet affair, but Jenny wanted to get revenge on Serena, and told the eponymous Gossip Girl about the party - knowing it would turn into this.
</li><li> A fairly mild example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueWaterHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueWaterHigh">Blue Water High</a></em>. Possibly unique in that the kids decide to come clean about it themselves rather than trying to cover it up.
</li><li> Although technically not a Wild Teen Party, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens">Even Stevens</a></em> does have a similar issue where, while the parents had to leave the house for a bit, Louis actually uses the opportunity to use the house as a hotel as a fund-raiser for a ski trip. Louis (and eventually Ren, as soon as she finds out and ends up allowing it to happen due to a boy at the house) eventually ended up having to get the guests to leave early due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise">parents coming home early</a> (When the parents called to check up on Louis, one of the guests answered and, mistaking "Louis" for her husband rather than the guy actually running the hotel, responded that Louis broke his back [Beans had injured the other Louis earlier due to using boots to massage his back], and the woman mistook her for a woman that Louis may have actually been seeing while still married to her.). They would have gotten away with it, had one of the guests also not also happen to be one of San Fancisco's news anchors and more importantly reported on the "hotel" on the news the next morning with the parents watching.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInbetweeners">The Inbetweeners</a></em>. The lads wind up at two house parties in total. The first one is rather lifeless and nothing really happens, bar Will hooking up with Charlotte (Will even refers to it as a shit party in the narration). The second is a birthday party that the lads gatecrash and, while it is busy, it's hardly wild especially as the boys simply stand around not talking to anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>: Rachel Berry attempts to have one. Needless to say, it fails miserably— until they break out the alcohol, that is.

He goes over, ends the party and takes Carmen home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> The former header image for this page was from "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">due to its natural setting</a>, has lots of lewd and out of control behavior going on when Monk accompanies Natalie and Captain Stottlemeyer to locate Stottlemeyer's son Jared, who has ditched school. Monk is horrified upon realizing what exactly he decided to tag along to, having thought when Stottlemeyer said the phrase "rock show" that he meant "geology exhibit". While waiting for Stottlemeyer and Natalie, Monk ends up making a very unsuccessful attempt to stop a couple from passionately making out on the hood of Stottlemeyer's car, yelling at them, "How old are you? There's no way you're 25!"
<ul><li> In fact, in every crowd scene, there are shirtless male extras or female extras who are literally only wearing their underwear or bikinis (for instance, the tan girl that Monk deflects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">a blue beachball</a> at while he's trying to find the payphones). Strangely, at no point in the episode does anyone think Monk looks unusual by wearing a blazer, slacks, and a dress shirt. The only three women who are fully clothed and are never engaged in any lewd behavior for the length of the episode are Natalie and Stork's girlfriend Kendra Frank.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted, for laughs, in "Mr. Monk is the Best Man". Monk organizes Stottlemeyer's bachelor party. Unfortunately, Stottlemeyer discovers the hard way that allowing Monk to plan a party, period, is <em>not</em> the way to go. Where do we start?
<ol><li>He somehow manages to stick a port-a-potty in the bathroom ("Monk, there's a bathroom in the bathroom!" "Where do you want me to put it, Mike? In the kitchen?" always is tickling).
</li><li>He orders pizza with literally <em>nothing</em> on it - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">not even sauce or cheese</a>!
</li><li>He has them drink sippy cups of juice before breaking out the booze.
</li><li>When he does hand out the beer, he promises one for each. And when he says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">one for each member</a>", he means it, because he gives one 12 ounce bottle for each attendee (12 total), meaning that, in an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDriver">another trope</a>, Randy must be assigned the role of "designated drunk".
</li><li>Monk tells a joke about Stottlemeyer's failed relationships that turns cold before he even reaches the punchline.
</li><li>Finally, Monk ends up choosing for their bachelor party movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BachelorParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BachelorParty">Bachelor Party</a></em>, a film that is implied to be unpopular with the other guys.
</li><li>The only time the party comes close to playing this trope straight is when Randy staggers in, drunk, asking who owns the Ford Crown Victoria parked out front that is painted a charcoal gray with flames on the side, and on the roof and windshield. This leads everyone to rush outside and find that someone has firebombed Stottlemeyer's car.

Ced and Lovita decide to have a party to celebrate Ced's having paid off his Hyundai, and override Romeo's pleas not to have it at Steve's. Of course the word gets out and practically everyone in Chicago shows up. Romeo frantically tries to keep the house clean during the party but the house gets trashed anyway. The next morning, Ced and Lovita come over to Steve's house to help Romeo clean up, but Steve comes home unexpectedly. Ced and Lovita quickly leave, leaving Romeo holding the bag.
<ul><li> Another episode has Romeo tricking Lydia into having a party while she is housesitting for Steve who is on a cruise. The party is in full swing when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Coretta</a>, angry that no one attended her Sweet 16 party, crashes it.

<ul><li> One series of strips featured an inversion of the trope: Similar to the bachelor party in "Mr. Monk Is the Best Man", Peter planned to have a Halloween Party to which his dad granted him permission (mostly because Roger apparently forgot Peter's actual age), so they were all set up, only for it to turn out that most if not all of the invited people were freshman (barring Denise and Steve), and Peter was having a terrible time. The closest it ever got to playing the trope straight was when some adults arrived at the party and attacked Peter, and they weren't even invited in the first place (apparently they wanted beer at their party).
</li><li> Played straight in an earlier series of strips where Paige and Nichole were invited to an upperclassman's party, where Paige was harassed by the lecherous host <em>three</em> times. (She clocked him the third time) and the thrill pretty much died when someone told them to find him, saying "some girl threw up in his bedroom". Eventually, when it became clear to the two of them that "unless you want to get drunk or stoned there's nothing to do" at the supposedly "cool" party, they were revolted and left.

Basically the overall nature of the party is some guys heavily smoking, heavily drinking, eating meat, telling tasteless jokes and exchanging crude insults. It rarely ever gets serious, however. Once, Miller attempted to supervise Paz in order to shield her from the nature of the parties, but he became drunk himself, and ended up stating to the MSF "Hey, you should see the real Kazuhira Miller" before mooning them, with the soldiers apparently finding it funny.

She ends up having to make do with people who she didn't intend to invite, some of them technically were legitimate in crashing the party (the Gross Sisters used invitations that were thrown out to enter Penny's party), and it took some time (and Aesops) for Penny to accept them as guests. Of course, by this time, LaCienaga's party went into an unexpected halt, and they merged with Penny's party, although Penny was still not too happy with her friends, considering locking them out, but decided against it, but still planning to exact revenge on them with the hair-in-a-glass trick that she pulled earlier in the party. Furthermore, Penny's parents are involved from the very beginning.
</li><li> The episode where Penny has a sleepover plays this straight as LaCienaga calls everyone in their middle school to come over to the house.

The typical result of the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> at the end: Madame Foster comes home and seems quite incensed about it...because the party was thrown without her. She gleefully moves onto the dance floor and the party continues.
</li><li> Terry's friend Howard throws one in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>. The party goes south when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> robot girlfriend interferes with his attempt to pick up other girls and starts destroying the house when he tries to break up with her. She ends up exploding, taking the house with her, just as Howard's parents come home, having run out of vacation money thanks to him using it to buy the robot girlfriend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">"The party peaked early"</a>, indeed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised">Unsupervised</a></em> Gary and Joel were only inviting over two girls in an attempt to impress them. Of course, half the school decides to show up, but unlike most cases Gary and Joel aren't shown to suffer any sort of punishment from the parents, which fits in with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">theme of the show</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>, the party actually <em>isn't</em> wild until <em>the school's principal and teacher</em> crash it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> featured one of these thrown at Hampton's house in "Hog Wild Hampton". Of course it wasn't his idea but Plucky's. Oddly, it's not the party goers who trash the place but a neighbor, Egghead, who does so out of retaliation for the noise the party is making which is disturbing his study time. Karma thankfully saves Hampton when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">a sweepstakes Hampton entered</a> awards him and his family with a new house.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Braceface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Braceface">Braceface</a></em> does this in the promptly named episode "Home Alone". Though in an aversion it's not Sharon who threw it, but her brothers who take advantage of the fact their babysitter had to leave them due to a family emergency. Sharon tries to be the responsible one doing the chores and whatnot. The one time she does try to loosen up and relax is when her mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeEarlySurprise">not surprisingly comes back early from her vacation</a>. Though her brothers get her off the hook by taking responsibility for the party, the most punishment Sharon gets is not getting the desired curfew extension she wanted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PixarShorts">Partysaurus Rex</a></em> does this with bath toys. Rex helps to fill up the bathtub with water so the toys can have fun. They have fun all right, complete with light raves. Rex fills up the water with bubble bath and blocks the overflow drain with a sponge, causing the water to keep on rising. But then he realizes that means the water might overflow and leak into the hall — not that the bath toys care. At one point, a toy police car arrives to control the situation, only to start having fun itself. After trying vainly to stop the rising water, Rex pulls out a stopper, which turns off the water, just as it reaches the top of the tub — only to realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">he accidentally turned on the shower</a>! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>...

When the demons are gotten rid of, Billy's mom assumes his dad did it.
</li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em> had the Test kids throwing one of these. Because this was before Hugh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> in the later seasons, he lets them go through with it as long as they don't turn off the lights, but he almost crashes the party when they briefly do to hide Johnny after their experiment to make him look good backfires and leaves him disfigured.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, Summer decides to throw a normal teen party when her parents leave, and Rick decides to throw a far wilder extra-dimensional party at the exact same time, making Summer's party wild by association.

In the end, she gives in to her desire to just have fun and it still becomes this, with her guests and even parents joining in on the festivities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nhlt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nhlt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nhlt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though still no alcohol</span>.

Bacchus, the God of Wine, decides to barge in and convinces Herc to instead organize a full-blown Bacchanal, bringing along basically all of Herc's classmates to a party so wild that Poseidon, God of the Seas, decides to sink the island given the Bacchanal is not letting him sleep. To restore the place, Herc and the god Hermes need to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> to get something Poseidon wanted in return for rising the island back - and it goes through Phil's convention, though thankfully he returns just in time.

In Narre Warren South, Australia, police cars and neighbours' property were damaged while Corey's parents holidayed in Queensland. Dozens of police officers, a helicopter and the dog squad had to be called in to restore the peace. A fabulously snarky TV interview (in which he refused to take off his sunglasses, "Because.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/us/28land.html">In January 2008<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a couple dozen teens in a rural area went to a vacant house for a party. They wound up doing several thousand dollars' worth of damage to the place. Obviously, that sucks, it was incredibly irresponsible. Unfortunately for all of us, though, the house happened to be a historic site, the former home of poet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertFrost">Robert Frost</a>. So what would have become a local problem and maybe some vandalism charges if the police ever figured out who was at the party turned into several days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KentBrockmanNews">Kent Brockman News</a> when the <em>New York Times</em> and other national news outlets devoted multiple headlines and editorials to this Wild Teen Party.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39659263/ns/local_news-miami_fl/">In October 2010,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Boca Raton, Florida, two teens at an elite private school decided to have their homecoming party at their parents' mansion, <em>with their parents there</em> but staying out of the way. Only about 150 people were expected to show up, but about 400 other teens crashed the party, bringing alcohol, and it went out of control. Several teens were arrested and the parents are being held responsible.
</li><li> Inspired by the <em>Project X</em> film example above is the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2206919/Riot-Facebook-party-attended-thousands.html">"Project X Haren" party<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from September 21, 2012. A teenager from some town out there in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">the Netherlands</a> called Haren sent out a Facebook invitation to her friends for her 16th birthday. Unfortunately, she forgot to set the invite to "private" and it was passed on to 30,000 people. 3,000+ people showed up to the small town and basically caused a riot: setting things on fire, smashing windows, skirmishes with the police, etc. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1keia');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1keia" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1keia');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Interestingly, this one happened with some unintentional corroboration from media, city officials and the mayor. The media caught on to the Facebook mishap and plastered it all over the headlines, the city actually considered (publicly) to organize something for the guests, and the mayor went back and forth on whether there would be a party or not. By the time the city had decided there would be no party, many people had already committed themselves to going anyway, party or no.</span>

Both of their bodies were still in the house, and several party guests noted the stench and even saw blood. He was found out after confessing to one of the partygoers, although not before planning another party for the next night.
