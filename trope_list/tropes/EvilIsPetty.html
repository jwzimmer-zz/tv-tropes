And then picks a pocket, trips an old lady, sticks a kick-me sign on a police officer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParkingProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParkingProblems">takes someone's parking space</a>, and cuts in line at a fast food place.
</p><p>They're not just evil on a large scale; they're evil on all the tiny little details of everyday life they might experience in any possible situation. This trope opposes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a> — this villain is just a colossal pain in the ass, even leaving their alignment out of the question. And often, they get a <em>kick</em> out of being a pain. And it must be pointed that petty motivations do not take from the cruelty and malice of the acts — in fact, they are just as likely to lead past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, and may even make the villain more hated to the audience than they would be otherwise, as there is nothing grandiose or admirable about him. They are just a scumbag of a bully. More often than not, it is a trait of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>.
</p><p>In video game settings with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, this means that being classified as Evil requires not just being uncaring towards people, but going out of your way being nasty in any circumstances. This is an unfortunate side effect of there being an in-game benefit from reaching particular levels of evil. When maxing out your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> gives you a Stat Boost, you're strongly encouraged to do every little act of evil you can to get there as quickly as possible.
</p><p>May overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>, a character massively despised for actual villainous actions. Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">Poke the Poodle</a> when <em>all</em> the supposed villain does is something actually harmless — they don't do anything overwhelmingly evil, but frequently behave like a mild dick to maintain their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">Villain Cred</a>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a> for someone who lives for doing this.
</p><p>An opposite trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>, in which a villain genuinely behaves in a very pleasant, friendly, and/or downright honorable manner. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> is well advised to avoid this trope; magnificence and pettiness don't mix.

For examples where a petty action ends up harming the villain, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">Dick Dastardly Stops to Cheat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a>. If the villain manages to keep his reasons secret until the climax and the protagonists act stupefied at the discovery of such a petty reason, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedByTheMotive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedByTheMotive">Disappointed by the Motive</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt">Badbutts</a> can have similarly petty motives.

</li><li> In the manga and <em>Brotherhood</em>, Shou Tucker voluntarily sacrificed his own family for a <em>research grant</em>, first his wife, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">his daughter and her dog</a>. <em>Brotherhood</em> adds a scene after Ed's done beating the stuffing out of him and while Al's trying to comfort Nina/Alexander. Tucker just crawls up to his nearly-broken State Alchemist pocket watch on the floor and happily declares that he'll get to <em>keep his job</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">Thankfully, Ed breaks the watch completely by kicking it out of Tucker's hand, saying there's no way in hell he'll get to keep his job after what he did.</a>

Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">the horrifying consequences</a>, Ren comes off as not just evil, but repulsively self-centered, vain, and <em>pathetic</em>.
<ul><li> Later in the manga, Ren finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akito has a box, which a maid had fixed up to comfort Akito after Akira's death (Akito had been told that her father's soul was in it).</span> Ren first <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sends Rin to steal the box for her, misleading Rin into thinking that she'll tell her how to break the Zodiac Curse if she does this, and leading to Rin being attacked and imprisoned by Akito (which Ren feels absolutely no remorse over),</span> and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">going to steal the box herself, threatening Akito at knifepoint</span>. All of this for a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>box</em>, and her justification simply being that everything of Akira's is hers by right. Akito hands the box over, only to reveal that it was completely empty the entire time. Akito and Ren had been at each other's throats over an ordinary, empty box</span>.

She helped set up the anti-human organization Fairy Tale and embarked on a mission to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a> all because she was jealous that her husband Issa paid more attention to his mistress Akasha Bloodriver than he did to her, and is perfectly willing to sacrifice her <em>own daughters</em> along the way. On top of it all, her reasons for wanting to exterminate humanity are not out of any real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>, but simply to spite Akasha's dream of human/monster coexistence.
</li><li> Although how evil she is is a bit debatable, Crea, the leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">evil organization</a> Jackal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ratman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ratman">Ratman</a></em>, ordered the titular hero (who is her underling) to cut the power to a restaurant because the waitress was rude and her food was late.

And later not only did he attack the first Hokage but also attempted to destroy Konoha all because he isn't declared Hokage. He then dips into sexism during his posturing to try and intimidate the Kages, looking down on Tsunade's strength because she's a woman (though to his credit, he quickly recants his statement when she wrecks his Susano'o). When you realize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a> Naruto is racing to thwart was cooked up by a spiteful, sexist warmonger out of no greater ambitions than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">as an ego trip</a></em>, it allows Madara to rather spectacularly avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>.</span>
<ul><li> It says a lot that even the Nine-Tailed Fox, a self-proclaimed "living mass of malevolence", finds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Madara</span> to be too much of a douchebag to tolerate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enough that he's willing to unconditionally help the protagonist defeat him.

(Despite this, after finally losing to Yuma and being arrested, he did admit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">that the duel was fun.</a>)
</li></ul></li><li> The reason many villains of the week in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> have to perform murder and widespread mayhem comes down to petty slights. To provide some examples:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Mad Bomber</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> <em>Countdown To Heaven</em> turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a famous painter, who remains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion">Beneath Suspicion</a> for most of the movie because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks">he's an old man</a> <em>and</em> he's wealthy and living a pleasurable life</span>.

He made his fame from replicating that view in his paintings, but fact still remains that he doesn't cares who gets caught as collateral damage in his retaliation.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer">The Devil Is a Part-Timer!</a></em>, after letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Emi Yusa stay at his place the night before since she lost her wallet during an attack, the police bring Maou in for questioning regarding the incident. To get released, he calls Emi in to sign for him in the middle of work despite all his other options because it's his duty as an overlord to annoy heroes. Then there was the whole manner of having Lucifer prank call her while she was at work. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">these are the evilest things he's ever actually shown doing</a>.
</li><li> A few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> villains fit the bill quite well:
<ul><li> Commander Red, leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">Red Ribbon Army</a>. We're initially led to believe that he wants to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Dragon Balls</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. By the end of the saga, it turns out he only wants to use the balls to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastefulWishing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastefulWishing">make himself taller</a>, and he's perfectly willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">sacrifice every last soldier in his army</a> to do so. When Staff Officer Black finds out, he's not pleased and promptly shoots him dead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Mercenary Tao</a>. For starters, after forcing a tailor to do a week's worth of work on his ruined uniform in three days, he refuses to pay him on the grounds that doing so would ruin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">his reputation as a cold, ruthless assassin</a>, and kills him instead (he offers to "pay" him by carrying out a contract killing on anybody of his choice, only for the tailor to (quite understandably) balk at that). Not only that, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that in the past, Tao killed Mr. Satan's master and beat Satan himself within an inch of his life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">simply because the two made fun of his hairstyle</a>.
</li><li> This is Frieza's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>. Going hand in hand with his overwhelming arrogance, Frieza can't resist doing unnecessarily cruel things to those weaker than him, often just to prove he can. This became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">his downfall</a> as it was his murder of Krillin in front of Goku — and <em>then</em> threatening to do the same to his son — that ultimately triggered Goku's ascension to Super Saiyan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">and resulting in him being blown to pieces and left for dead.</a> Even when he is brought back as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> for the Tournament of Power, Frieza can't help but indulge in this: Upon finding out that Cabba is something of a student for Vegeta, he resolves to defeat and ring out Cabba for <em>just</em> that reason. Surprisingly, Frieza's beatdown of Cabba was arguably the least drawn out or brutal one he had handed out until that point, but even so, he tells the helpless Saiyan that he will hunt down his teammates next <em>just</em> to get a rise out of him.
</li><li> Vegeta, during his Evil Prince days. For starters, his response to Goku giving him a bloody lip was to absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> and try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">blow up the Earth</a> out of spite.
</li><li> Dr. Gero's entire vendetta against Goku, which resulted in the Android and Cell Sagas, is simply because Goku cost him his job and funding when Goku destroyed the Red Ribbon Army... at least, in his early depictions and his initial appearances. Later material reveals his motivation goes somewhat deeper, and while it's still very myopic (his son may have died for Red Ribbon, but his son still died for a leader who didn't care about his men and a cause that would've made the world a worse place) and ultimately petty, it's at least more understandable.
</li><li> Spopovich beats Videl within an inch of her life, to the extent Videl is <em>crying in agony</em>, purely because Mr. Satan, her father, beat him in the last tournament. It's even implied he let Babidi control him just so he could get back at Mr. Satan.
</li><li> Beerus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em>. While more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a>, he has a history of destroying planets for pretty petty reasons, such as losing at video games or being denied food. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, the Old Kai even explicitly describes Beerus' acts of destruction as pointless and petty.
</li><li> Zamasu, part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a> of <em>Super's</em> Future Trunks Saga. When it comes down to it, everything he does during the saga is purely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">to get back at Goku for losing to him in a simple sparring match</a></span>. It's even worse in the manga, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he never even <em>meets</em> Goku. He just sees his fight with Hit on Godtube and becomes furious at the idea of a mortal rising to the power of a god</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Goku Black</a>, the other part of the saga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a>. Before he was Goku Black, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was Zamasu, the Apprentice Supreme Kai of U10. After losing a sparring match with Goku and learning that he had access to god energy through his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, he goes off the deep end and begins a plan to wipe out all the mortals in the multiverse. After using the Super Dragon Balls to take Goku's body, he teleported to Earth and personally killed Goku, who's trapped in his old body, and then butchered his family. Since he goes to Future Trunks' timeline after this, there was no reason for him to murder Goku or his family. He did it purely out of spite</span>.
</li><li> While making a movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">Barry Khan</a> allows Gohan to be a stuntman and hopes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">he'll be badly injured at the very least</a> simply because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithRejection">Videl snubbed him when he tried hitting on her</a>. He then tries to ruin Gohan's marriage by setting him up with Cocoa, taking pictures of her kissing Gohan, and then showing those pictures to Videl. Videl isn't fooled for a minute and shreds the pictures before shooting Barry down with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, remarking how pathetic it is that Barry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">is treated like royalty and still acts like an insecure little brat</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Videl</strong>: Did it sting that much to be told I don't need your autograph? Does seeing Gohan stand out sting that badly? You get treated like royalty, but you have no self-confidence. How pitiful.
</div><ul><li> Broly. A ludicrously powerful Saiyan who managed to survive Planet Vegeta's destruction, his entire reason for his beef with the heroes...is because when he and Goku were babies, they were in the same ward, and Goku was <em>crying. THAT'S IT. Broly is homicidally angry at Goku because he cried.</em>

In the entirety of his screen time, he has outed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">sister as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">a Norma</a>, sent her to no-person's island to fight against dragons from a different world, lures her out by making their youngest sister pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>, making their youngest sister attack Ange, and subject her to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> leading to a public lashing and hanging. All in order to get rid of her and quell any uprisings that might have been caused by the revelation of the family secret of harboring a norma and reclaim the royal ring given to Ange. After that plot fails and Ange escapes, Julio jumps at the opportunity given to him by Embryo: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">extermination of all norma</a>, which naturally includes Ange. Embryo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestartTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestartTheWorld">motives</a> are a little different; Julio only wants to kill his sister.
</li><li> A lot of villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> are doing things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, but the most notable examples are Steely Dan and Dio Brando: the former takes advantage of holding the protagonist's grandfather hostage by treating him like a lowly servant, having him clean his shoes and build him a human bridge over a small gap. Also, he overcharges Joseph for kebabs before attacking the heroes, and he takes as much pleasure from that as from any of the legitimate things he did to them. Dio Brando, on the other hand, is having fun with his Stand ability <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to stop time</span> by killing a stray cat and messing around with bystanders' food. Both of their karmas are built this way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">to piss Jotaro off</a>.

<ul><li> Once he realizes he can't kill the Barry Allen (the second Flash) in the past without disrupting his own timeline (Barry is his inspiration), Professor Zoom begins an anonymous reign of terror over the Barry's childhood, seeing just how far he can go while keeping his history intact.

This contrasts with his otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">polite and cultured</a> persona and shows that, for all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">intelligence and cunning</a>, he is still just a street thug.
</li><li> As much as he talks of never letting his emotions get the better of him, the Kingpin can take a slight to an insane level. When a waiter at a restaurant hands him the check (unaware Fisk's dinners are always comped), the Kingpin orders an underling to track the waiter down and ensure the hand that held the check is mangled beyond repair.

</li><li> Sleeze, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New God</a> in charge of porn, is the embodiment of this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> banished Sleeze from Apokolips because he thought a god of porn was too petty to play any part in his schemes to conquer reality. It says something when <em>Darkseid</em> thinks you are too petty. His lowest moment came when he had total mental control over Superman and Big Barda, another powerful New God, and instead of forcing them to do any number of terrible atrocities against the human race, he made them star in a porno just because he can and to see her poor husband's (Mister Miracle) reaction.
</li><li> Speaking of The Lord of Apokolips, he usually plays this trope straight - examples include forcing his minions to murder their pets, murdering (or trying to murder) relatives of his enemies for foiling his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme">Evil Schemes</a>, executing his minions for speaking out of turn, and setting free his slaves...and putting them in charge of the next batch, just so the hero can watch them become as cruel as the old slave drivers.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> has many moments where he indulges himself in petty acts of evil and cruelty. He once frequented a diner for a week so he could court a particular waitress. Then he offered her a life of fame and luxury if she would be his lover. But he drove away in his limo before she could make a decision, leaving her to ponder opportunities lost. Just something to amuse himself with.
</li><li> He also once strangled his female martial arts instructor, just because she knocked him down during a sparring session. It was also a case of him being able to rub his superiority in the face of Superman (who'd just been killed fighting Doomsday), as now he could freely commit crimes on a whim without having to worry about Supes making him pay for it. Post-Crisis Luthor is depicted as a petulant asshole who holds grudges against anyone who even slightly challenges his authority.
</li><li> He also frequently addresses Clark Kent as "Mr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>" and openly puts the moves on Lois and/or makes disparaging comments about Clark's masculinity right in front of them, <em>just</em> to be an irritating dick to two people whom he dislikes.
</li><li> Taken to new lows in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBlackRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBlackRing">The Black Ring</a></em>. Luthor gives up omnipotence and the chance to give everyone in the universe eternal bliss — all because one of the conditions of keeping that power is that he can't do anything negative with that power such as, say, destroying Superman. To Luthor, godhood is meaningless if he can't use it to crush his greatest foe.
</li><li> Luthor's entire grudge against Superman is proof of his pettiness. He's all but admitted that the only reason he hates Supes with such a passion is that Superman is the first person he met that is both more powerful than he is and completely unwilling to bend to his will. The fact that he's the world's greatest hero and has inspired others to defy Luthor only galls him more. Supes has called him out on this complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">waste of his potential</a> multiple times to no avail.

Later writers usually try to work around this by depicting his firing as the breaking point of a life filled with pent-up frustration to at least better frame his vendetta. The symbiote itself is less petty; it wants Peter dead because he rejected it once he found out it was alive and wanted to make their bond permanent, which on a surface level basically puts the symbiote on the same level as a jilted ex-girlfriend, but Peter nearly killed it in the process, which makes the Symbiote's frustration a bit more understandable, though not justified.

To create the "Crown of Fire", an artificially started and prolonged solar eclipse, so he can <em>walk upon a beach like a normal being one time before he dies</em>. In case this doesn't sound petty enough, one should be aware that not only is Vhostym an incredibly powerful (Archmage-level) Wizard/Psion, meaning he has a wide variety of far less evil methods of doing this (including body-snatching others to experience the world through their senses and shapechanging into non-albino forms so he isn't burnt/blinded by the son), he's also lived for millennia and so has had dozens of opportunities to do during natural solar eclipses. Cale himself calls Vhostym on this at the trilogy's end; Vhostym simply retorts that it "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">wouldn't be as satisfying</a>" to do things that way, and besides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">he is strong enough to do it his way, so he will do things his way</a>.

</li><li> Invoked in-universe with Snape. Harry and Ron are convinced that Snape is evil because...he's mean to Harry (and to a lesser extent, Gryffindors in general) all the time. It's not until Book 6 (out of 7) that he actually does something outright evil. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, it later turns out he did it for altruistic reasons, completely subverting this trope.

He's forbidden to harm Ransom, the protagonist, unless Ransom attacks first, so while the Eve equivalent is sleeping, he spends his time doing such petty things as killing small animals and tearing up the turf, even resorting to childishly tormenting Ransom ("Ransom!" "What?" "Nothing." ... "Ransom!"). Ransom is quite disturbed by this, finding it more troubling than he would a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">clever, charismatic Satan</a> (he can be very charismatic, but only when he's trying to convince the Queen to sin). He comes to realize that Satan considers <em>all</em> virtues, including cleverness, taste, and the capacity to feel shame, to be a means to an end and discards them when they do not serve his purposes. He is pure evil and cares for nothing but making things worse for everyone else.
<ul><li> Lewis' logic of the pettiness of evil is further explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters">The Screwtape Letters</a></em>. It's complex, but the reasoning is actually fairly sound; when you need a steady influx of sinners, it's in their best interest to keep a good flow of slightly evil folks that are afflicted by petty vices coming down. Sure, they're not as enjoyable as spectacular sinners of legend, but it makes sure Hell isn't starved of souls when such are in short supply.

Crowley's M.O. is perpetuating petty evil. Other demons will spend all their time trying to corrupt a politician or cause a priest to lose his faith. Crowley sets up telemarketing networks and causes traffic jams. Other demons accomplish one great act of evil. Crowley accomplishes a hundred thousand petty acts of evil, thus, <em>in the aggregate</em>, causing more evil than the other demons. Not that the other demons see it his way...

But after the Ring escapes from human Isildur (who it betrayed at the first available chance), it's only found and used by hobbits, rather than creatures with power and sweeping dreams of grandeur to corrupt. The Ring, in short, gets to serve <em>mischief</em> rather than capital-E evil: Déagol only wants to possess a beautiful thing... and, is promptly murdered before he can do something with it. Sméagol uses the Ring to torment his relatives and decides to hide for millennia in the heart of a mountain, only using it to survive day by day. Bilbo uses the Ring to mainly to escape from his obnoxious relatives and neighbors or play what amounts to pranks. Frodo mostly wants adventure and uses it only to try to survive the process (usually by hiding), only falling at the last minute to fully claim it... exactly when the ring cannot help him. Sam's possible dreams of conquest are so nebulous (an army of enslaved gardeners?) that even he finds the Ring's attempts to find <em>something</em> to work with utterly ridiculous, and just laughs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Sauron never got the chance to reclaim his ring with those completely small-time losers, even though it was really trying very hard to get back to him</a>.

This means that since 1497 AD, every good person has gone to the Bad Place just because they exist in the same world as bad jerks who they have never met, all because humanity developed culturally and learned to trade with and tolerate other cultures who had a few bad people.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>, the only way for the game to register you being evil is to randomly murder townspeople, though you can also choose to be unpleasant to everyone you meet. Most of the main- and side-quests shift your reputation upwards, to the degree that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> you eventually gain is often used by evil players just for controlling unchecked alignment growth.

Even a lot of actions that should be evil but aren't pointlessly so (like committing genocide on the Elk Tribe instead of negotiating peace) don't shift you down.
</li><li> Despite the pretenses of being a deeper philosophical movement, with only a few exceptions the Way of the Closed Fist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> in practice seems to amount to being a dick to everyone you meet, mugging peasants for insignificant amounts of silver, and generally ostracizing and ruining the lives of everyone around you for no other reason than because you can.
<ul><li> A particularly egregious example is a situation where a mother asks you to help her daughter who is being sold into slavery. The choices are to save the daughter, to sell the daughter AND the mother to the slaver or to convince the daughter to show her individual strength by killing the slaver and thus "earn" her freedom. According to the stated philosophy of the Closed Fist, the third option is the closest to it, as the daughter has proved that she has the strength and will to survive by overcoming her would-be captor. Yet, it is the cartoonishly evil option, selling both to the slaver, that earns the most Closed Fist points AND a Closed Fist martial arts move. Exemplified by the fact that, once you have enough Dark Si...Closed Fist points, the game actually unlocks a context-sensitive move to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">KICK PUPPIES.</a>

The way their philosophy is written actually sounds reasonable - following your passions will lead to personal freedom.

<ul><li> A long sidequest that, at one point, requires you to notify a father of the death of his son (who was mauled by a pack of space wolves) offers the option to refer to the unfortunate lad as a chew toy. Truly a sign of pure evil. Although in Bioware's defense, it DOES offer the option to extort money from the poor man in exchange for his son's journal.
</li><li> Discussed in the second game. You can threaten to kill a beggar, sending him running away. Your creepy mentor Kreia will ask what the point was and the Exile will reply that these petty cruelties are all the universe gives them most of the time.

This is bizarre coming from a development company that has tended toward reputation over alignment-based systems, applied to a series that has never placed as much story or game emphasis on karma as on reputation, and in a genre that just doesn't support the polar alignment model.
<ul><li> The earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games essentially invert this trope, as every little errand you can run for anyone gives good karma, even if you're paid to do it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> puts little emphasis on karma, so the game mostly averts this. That, and it's borderline impossible to end up with anything but Very Good karma, unless you ironically choose to <em>not</em> fight back against Powder Gangers trying to rob you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">which would be something you'd think a Good character would do</a>.
<ul><li> In-story, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Caesar, a man who threatens to kill you if you bring up his defeat at Hoover Dam and throws a temper tantrum, complete with name-calling if you refuse to work for him. In <em>Honest Hearts</em> it's also revealed that he ordered New Canaan — a peaceful, prosperous, altruistic town — to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">slaughtered and burned</a>. He did this just to spite Joshua Graham, who was born there. His entire faction seems to operate on this logic. One of the actions that gets you Legion fame? Taking a little girl's teddy bear, watching her cry, and then ripping it up in front of her.
</li><li> For the NCR, there's Colonel Cassandra Moore. If the player works with Ambassador Dennis Crocker to resolve the situation with the Kings peacefully as well as make a truce with the Brotherhood of Steel, Moore will not only get Crocker fired from his job but also go on a smear campaign that reduces the Courier's rep with the NCR.
</li><li> Dean Domino is pretty much the entire reason the Sierra Madre is full of aggravating bullshit that can easily kill you, including poisonous gas that constantly ticks down your health whenever you are outside. It was all part of his scheme to utterly ruin the Sierra Madre's owner, Frederic Sinclair. Why did he want to ruin Sinclair? Because Sinclair was <em>happier than him</em>, which due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a> Dean interpreted as Sinclair deliberately and maliciously rubbing his success in his face. Also, it's completely impossible to convince Dean to ally with you in the end if you insult him even once. This means you constantly have to kiss his ass whenever you talk to him and deliberately not pass any of his (very low) skill checks (because, like with Sinclair, he'll interpret that as you showing off and thinking you're better than him), even though he's a total dick who you'd probably gun down within two seconds if it wasn't for the fact that your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">Explosive Leashes</a> are linked to each other so that if he dies, so do you. In fact, <em>he'd</em> certainly gun <em>you</em> down within two seconds if it wasn't for that fact.

Just like killing enemies won't give you good points. The good/evil axis is defined instead as selflessness vs. selfishness: are you going to turn off that valve and get more psychotropic gunk all over you or are you going to make that random dude there do it for you?
<ul><li> You actually do gain tiny amounts of evil karma for assaulting random pedestrians, but it's hardly enough to notice unless you really invest some time in it, and you can actually recover it by healing them afterward.

The millions of petty evils you're used to committing as an RPG protagonist (B&amp;E, petty theft, occasional muggings and murders, running away before your allies do, etc...) are progress-hampering errors in a game where the goal is to become a paragon of self-denying and self-sacrificing virtue. Most evils you perform are when weighed against the crimes of villains past, petty and basically meaningless - but any of them can stop you in your tracks until you atone for them.
<ul><li> The Virtues which became a staple of the series from then on were partly a response to real life criticisms that the previous Ultimas let you be as evil and petty as you like without consequence.

Whether it's ruining someone's life, turning people into strange objects, or wanton acts of mass slaughter, it's all part of the same sick game.

His desire to steal candy from a baby afterward is a sign that he's crossed the line. And a plot point, believe it or not. But Burns' pettiest moment was in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E22" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E22">Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"</a>", where he was willing to kill Grampa Simpson, <em>his commanding officer</em> over paintings they hid away during the war. Yeah, priceless paintings, but he is plenty rich. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He then tries to <em>kill</em> Bart for insulting him after he took away the paintings at gunpoint</span>.
<ul><li> The episode "And Maggie Makes Three" showcases that Burns has a special door in his office for those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheBurntBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheBurntBridge">coming back begging to get their jobs back</a>: it is labeled "Supplicants" and it's a tiny tunnel that forces people to literally come crawling to him, covered in dirt and spider-webs. And because Homer got pretty cheeky when he quit, Burns orders a special plaque to be installed in Homer's station that reads: "DON'T FORGET — YOU'RE HERE FOREVER", to kill Homer's spirit.
</li><li> Burns' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalRapSheet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalRapSheet">Historical Rap Sheet</a> includes him ordering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockUnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockUnsolvedMysteries">the assassination of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmeliaEarhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmeliaEarhart">Amelia Earhart</a></em> — Burns felt "that woman was getting too big for her britches".

He does it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">even when it is to his detriment to do so</a>, such as when he chased another motorist down the freeway for <em>miles</em> and threatened to club him with a baseball bat when he caught up to him - causing the family to miss their vacation flight to Hawaii - just because the other guy cut him off while changing lanes. Yes, the cutting-off was completely unjustified and itself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> move, but <em>Homer</em>!

<ul><li> Robotnik commits petty crimes in his spare time when he's not trying to take over Mobius. For example, one of the ways he uses his new superpowers in "Super Robotnik" is to steal candy from 4,822 babies.
</li><li> Even more damning is Robotnik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> - he tried to kill a guy with a robotic snake because the girl Robotnik was in love with the guy instead! And when he started his conquest of Mobius, he was the first guy he locked up!
</li></ul></li><li> While it's more subtle, Robotnik's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> counterpart has blatant shades of this too, he takes much pleasure in the fact his industries are polluting and destroying the planet, and rather actively belittles his minions (usually Snively) or gloats over his roboticized slaves.

Examples include:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E4Buster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E4Buster">Buster</a>", he creates a fireman robot at the beginning of the episode to attack the village and has the robot do things like put a baby walrus in a burning house or putting a kitten <em>in</em> a tree.

When he doesn't win regardless of his cheating, he decides to have his Bee Bots attack the gala.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E6FortressOfSqualitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS1E6FortressOfSqualitude">Fortress of Squalitude</a>", he hires and later kidnaps Amy... to force her to redecorate his lair so he'd be on the cover of a magazine that features evil lairs.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS3E45ThreeMinutesOrLess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SonicBoomS3E45ThreeMinutesOrLess">Three Minutes or Less</a>" has Eggman realizing that Sonic is working at Meh Burger and comes up with a plan to make Sonic late in hopes of Eggman getting the meal for free.

Cartman has shown that his ruthless intellect could propel him to the top as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>, but he frequently sabotages his own efforts when they don't cause suffering to his designated targets. When not causing mass murder, inciting riots, trying to start another Holocaust, giving Kyle AIDS, engaging in piracy, or manipulating Cthulhu to do his bidding, etc., he will do things like toilet papering a teacher's house or giving Butters a Dirty Sanchez in his sleep. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> was murdering Scott Tenorman's parents and sticking their corpses in Scott's stew, simply to get back at Scott for cheating him out of $16.12 and to literally lick Scott's tears off his face.

He will rip a man's arm off for one, sell his fry cook's soul for less than a dollar and in "Plankton's Regular," he becomes obsessed with taking away Plankton's first (and only) customer simply because he "just can't afford" letting Plankton have any business, legitimate or otherwise, despite this meaning he wouldn't have to worry about the safety of the Krabby Patty formula anymore.

</li></ul></li><li> The villains of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> tend to be a pretty petty bunch. Candy Sweet from "The Black Widows" was turned down by the Honeybees cheerleading squad as a kid, so she kidnaps them and builds an army of robots that uses the Honeybees' moves to infiltrate an international cheerleading contest and slaughter the competition (quite literally) in the finals. Dr. Bittersweet from "Passion Patties" was kicked out of the Happy Girls for eating the cookies she was supposed to sell, so she tries to discredit them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">super-addictive</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBulkChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBulkChange">super-fattening</a> cookies.
