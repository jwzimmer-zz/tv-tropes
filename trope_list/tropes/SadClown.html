This is usually of little comfort to the Sad Clowns, whose insecurities causes them to fear that people only really like the "Clown" part of them, and so they do their damnedest to always be the "Clown" in public, but bury and suppress the "Sad" side of them as deeply as possible, because they are afraid that people would like them less if they were to find out about it.

</li><li> Ebisu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dorohedoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dorohedoro">Dorohedoro</a></em> shows signs of this after getting Chota's hairclip stuck in her brain.

He's also got a particularly tragic past (orphan, lost his best friend to disease because only the rich people got the vaccine, bounced between foster homes before settling in a church with a caring priest and sister, only to lose them to a pointless battle) and refers to himself as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a>", not boasting about his ability to kill enemy pilots but because the specter of Death seems to hover around him at all times.

Underneath it all is a rather broken and solemn teenager.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rare female example: Anna Heart, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a> artist from the Kaleido Stage who wants to be a comedian, but hides how deeply hurt she's been after her father Jack (a.k.a.

</li><li> Jack was one of these too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The reason why he left is that he was swindled by his manager, and left home because he couldn't face Julia and Anna as well as the crash of his dreams.</span> And he was getting <em>worse</em>, evolving into a very embittered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker">Stepford Snarker</a> who told <em>cruel</em> jokes that mocked everyone (something he had never done in the past) until Anna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">got to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">confront</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">him</a>.

We never get the full story, but one episode reveals she only became like this after her fiance died in an accident. When she's forced to relive it she nearly turns suicidal. It wasn't even the only boyfriend she'd lost!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The eponymous character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is partially this along with being a Trickster. Having grown up as something of a pariah for having the Nine-Tails Fox, he grows up to hate the harsh looks the villagers give him. He turns to be a brash prankster as it's still much less harsh than being viewed as something not meant to exist. He more or less grows out of it, though sometimes it's more than the reasons change.
</li><li> Iruka is implied to have been like this, having lost both his parents to the Nine-Tailed Fox. Unlike Naruto, he did not have to deal with being hated, but he acted the way he did to ease his loneliness. He reaches out to Naruto when he realizes they have this in common and becomes Naruto's first father figure.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Possibly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luffy</span>, considering the things we've learned about his past in the last few years. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After his complete and utter breakdown after Ace's death, it becomes devastatingly clear that underneath his cool, strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> exterior, can awaken a scared boy who's terrified that he's too weak to protect his loved ones and that he's generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">nowhere near as innocent, carefree or stupid as he might want you to believe</a>.</span>
</li><li> Brook practically runs on this trope, being a walking pun factory on the subject of his supernatural disfigurement. At inappropriate times? You bet. He is also quite the pervert. We discover that he and his crew died in the most dangerous sea before being able to fulfill their promise to return to the friend they left behind. Only Brook's Devil Fruit which allowed him to come back from death just once offered the slightest chance of fulfilling their promise and even then he had to wait 50 years alone before the Strawhats came. After a major loss for the crew leading to a separation arc, he was put on display in a freak show cage for crowds to scream at in disgust. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he met the "get people to like him" criteria in truly epic fashion. It's good to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRockStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRockStar">Soul King</a>.</span>
</li><li> Luffy's brother Ace is a pretty jovial guy, much like Luffy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And just like Luffy, he's got a lot of hidden insecurities. He spent his entire life thinking that he didn't deserve to be born.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Break from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em> teases everyone mercilessly, smiles constantly and has a ventriloquist (probably) act going with a doll he keeps on his shoulder. And is as utterly broken as if not more so than anyone else in the main cast.
</li><li> Sasame flirts (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">heh</a>) with this trope in the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>. He's <em>constantly</em> flirting with the main character and teasing the other knights, and at first, it seems like he takes NOTHING seriously... but several scenes hint that he's not quite as much of a jokester as it seems. This particularly comes into play when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he reveals he was in love with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the past</span>, and you consider what happened to the <em>anime</em> version because of that...

As a result, she has a lot of anxiety and sadness deep down. Her writers even called her a character with "high highs" and "low lows".

The Jester has quite a sad tone as he sings about how he longs to have power like his sister's, although he goes back to a more clownish tone at the end of the song, as he accepts that he's still a jester.

Andre then shows a picture of himself during his experiences in Poland, and he looks desperately unhappy, despite being "reborn" there. He then notes that a picture he had of Chiquita which he thought looked sexy now looked, with his more experienced eyes, as very sad.

Lewis eventually came <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/film-cannes-lewis/jerry-lewis-plays-both-straight-man-and-clown-at-cannes-festival-idUSL6N0E41PD20130523">out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and said he will never release it, not because of financial problems, but because he's simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">that ashamed of it</a>.
</li><li> The 1930 German film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlueAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlueAngel">The Blue Angel</a></em> uses this trope for dramatic effect, as the main character's loss of dignity, fall in society and descent into madness are punctuated by his donning of a clown costume. His first performance in full clown make-up, where he is continually debased and forced to crow like a cock, is the climax of the movie and shows just how pathetic the once proud man has become.
</li><li> Red Skelton, who was known for TV and film comedy, plays one of these in 1953's "The Clown" (a remake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChamp">The Champ</a>), where Red plays Dodo Delwyn, a washed-up clown who struggles with alcoholism.

After finding out his mom lied about her connections with Thomas Wayne after confronting him in person and stealing confidential documents regarding how her boyfriend abused him, he goes to her hospital bed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> about how hes never been happy his entire life, despite his condition causing him to laugh, and realizing his life is, not a tragedy, but a fucking comedy, right before suffocating her to death.

His original plan is to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head after opening with a knock-knock joke. However, he changes his mind while in his dressing room. Instead, he opens with a joke about police officers informing a woman about her son being fatally struck and killed by a drunk driver, then responds to the disapproval from Murray and the staff by confessing he murdered the Wall Street people.

His only alternative to observing the people of Earth make friends and live their lives is to escape to a barren mushroom planet with absolutely no intelligent life aside from himself. It's not until he attempts to play a climactic inning of baseball with himself that his loneliness finally overwhelms him, causing him to unleash his stress by running fast enough to cause a nationwide blackout and kick off the plot.

</li><li> Members of the Fools' Guild in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> often lapse into this, sometimes forgetting if they're supposed to be "happy on the outside and crying on the inside, or the other way 'round." This is understandable since the Fools generally don't lead pleasant lives. Indeed, it is common knowledge on the Disc that Fools simply cannot be funny ("if it was funny, a clown wouldn't be doing it"), and clowns are regarded as inherently pitiful or scary, rather than comedic. Exemplifying this is the fact that the guildhall is often mistaken for that of the Assassins, which is actually the light, airy building next door. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, it began as a monastery for a particularly sombre group of monks, and the founder of the Fools' Guild was shaped in his philosophy towards comedy by the fact that A: he was honestly nowhere near as funny as he believed himself to be, B: a mindset that convinced him that jokes and humor were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> and should be treated with great dignity and respect, and C: the very pronounced trait of Discwolders, especially those in Ankh-Morpork, to be realistic and literal-minded to the point of being deliberately obtuse, which doesn't make joking an easy matter. The result is that generations of Fools have had their emotions crushed and any actual knack for humor (not to mention desire to make people laugh) stamped out of them. <br/><br/>The head of the Fool's Guild is Dr. Whiteface, whose makeup has a big painted smile... while his actual expression is "as cold and proud as a prince of Hell". And to top it off, we find out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> that the clowns are still very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMonksKnowKungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMonksKnowKungFu">Monks</a> when we see a former clown who ran away from the lifestyle as a boy, still retaining only the basics of the skills he'd been taught with.

This character, from Belgian poet Albert Giraud, has been a fascination of early 20th century composers: Karol Rathaus composed a ballet about him.

His character Wearie Willie was known for sweeping up the spotlight after the other performers and he won the hearts of audiences at a time when they expected clowns to make them laugh. He was a staple of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus for a good chunk of the Twentieth Century before going freelance.
</li><li> In the 1914 play <em>He Who Gets Slapped</em> by Leonid Andreyev, Baron Regnard plagiarizes the title character's work and steals his wife. To hide from the pain of this experience, "He" runs away to France and joins the circus as a clown. In his act, he plays a great philosopher who is slapped by the rest of the troupe.
</li><li> Feste from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em> is very often played this way, although there's no real evidence for it in the text.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Episode 5, on the Vigilante path, Alfred of all people qualifies for this trope, welcoming Bruce with a joke about a man with shaky hands when Bruce comes to after having fallen several stories down a building and being impaled on a piece of debris, having been lifted off and carried to the Batmobile by Catwoman/Agent Avesta (whoever helps Batman depends on the path taken) right before losing consciousness.

</li><li> Pretty much any teammate who makes jokes can be considered this, due to the fact that they all have issues of their own, and the entire galaxy's going to hell. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Kasumi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Goto</a> is possibly the only joker who is an exception to this, as even though she does have problems in her past, she genuinely seems to have moved past them (unless she's just <em>really</em> good at covering them up).
<ul><li> It's implied that deep down, Kasumi <em>isn't</em> over the death of her lover, Keiji. Depending on how her loyalty mission ends and if Keiji's greybox was saved, Shepard will repeatedly express concern in <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> that Kasumi is spending too much time watching his memories and not enough making her own. One possible ending in <em>3</em> heavily implies that if she survived, she will spend the rest of her life in seclusion hopelessly reliving her old memories with the greybox.

When Dr. Otto Octavius loses his temper during a failed experiment and starts cursing out Mayor Osbourne, Peter is quick to burst out a joke about said mayor, to which he admits in the ensuing awkward silence afterward that he has a habit of joking in tense situations. Otto calmly commends him for the joke he told, averting how one would normally respond to this trope.
<div class="indent"><strong>Otto:</strong> DAMMIT!

He even addresses himself as a sad clown in his brief song number, only for his girlfriend to have second thoughts and come back to him.
</li><li> Weasel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAnimalsOfFarthingWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAnimalsOfFarthingWood">The Animals of Farthing Wood</a></em> is constantly making insulting wisecracks, more frequently when they are more inappropriate.

His cheerful exterior and fun-loving personality is a way to cope and ignore the guilt he feels for running away from his home and people and getting frozen, allowing the Fire Nation to wage war for a century, wiping out his people. He finally faces his guilt later on when he's mentored by Guru Pathik.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Iroh</a> counts as well. Underneath his goofy facade, he's just a father grieving the loss of his son. He's also done plenty of things in the past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">that he's not proud of</a>.
</li><li> Sokka shows signs of this, as well. While usually a complete goofball in groups or around Katara, when confiding in friends or by himself, he shows that he's actually very insecure and sad; his mother died when he was a child, his father left to fight a war shortly thereafter, he's (initially) the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">muggle</a> in a group of superpowered warriors, and even he believes that he might be too goofy to be of any real help. As he gains more confidence during the series, his jokester tendencies become slightly less-pronounced and he becomes more easy-going than lazy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Toph</a>, when all is said and done, has more baggage than a cargo ship: she was always treated like a fragile thing by her parents, ran away from home after they said they'd be even more strict about protecting her (even after she showed first-hand that she was already one of the best earthbenders in the world at TWELVE), is legitimately torn over how she must have broken her parents hearts &amp; makes them worry, as a result, feels responsible for Appa having been kidnapped, and is actually terribly insecure about her blindness (despite acting like it's a non-issue normally). Outwardly, she seems like a total snark-bender who doesn't really care about anything, save for her friends.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> references the trope, as Rocko had always wanted a portrait of "<a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/Mi8tCYM.jpg">A Sad Crying Clown in an Iron Lung<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>", but could never afford it - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditCardPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditCardPlot">until he got a credit card</a>.
</li><li> Beast Boy from the <em>Teen Titans</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">animated series</a> is an insecure and vulnerable kid who constantly uses humour as a defense mechanism.
<ul><li> Similarly, his appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, he's usually seen as very cheerful, cracking jokes, and keeping Kid Flash's tradition of collecting souvenirs from their mission, but we learn that he's deeply haunted by the death of his mother, and upon coming across a location that looks identical to spot where she died, he's reduced to tears.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> has Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, who may as well be the poster-boy for this trope. He's possibly the most sensitive, emotionally vulnerable character on the show (next to Rogue, his adopted sister), and spends a good deal of his time angsting over his appearance (in early episodes) and his mother, Mystique (in later episodes). Nevertheless, he is the resident "goof-ball", trying his best to appear the carefree joker when deep down, he's anything but carefree.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a> admits to this himself in the episode "Cry Freedom Fighters!" after Batman expresses his skepticism about him joining the eponymous team.
<div class="indent"><strong>Plastic Man:</strong> C'mon, Bats. No one's ever wanted me to be a part of their team. Even the League threw me out. Give me a chance to be a part of something—to prove to myself that I'm not a three-time loser.
</div></li><li> Notably <em>not</em> the Flash on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, as illustrated nicely in the episode <em>Flash and Substance</em>. Some people just don't seem to get it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Orion:</strong> I understand now. You play the clown to hide a warrior's pain. <br/><strong>Flash:</strong> Dude...the bad guys went down, and nobody got hurt. You know what I call that? A really good day.
</div><ul><li> It is possible that the high-energy lifestyle and constant peppiness could be a result of him being aware of how dangerous his powers actually are to himself and the people around him, but it's less about masking angst and more about thoroughly enjoying every moment he gets.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: In "Appleoosa's Most Wanted" Trouble Shoes is this played as straight as they come. He's constantly getting into accidents through either his terrible clumsiness or just plain bad luck, and bemoans his fate just as often, even when he's not at fault!
<ul><li> Some fans have pegged Pinkie Pie as one of these. In "Party of One", the constantly-cheerful party pony is quick to fall into a funk when she thinks her friends don't want to come to her parties or be friends with her anymore. In the episode, "The Cutie Mark Chronicles", it is revealed that she was raised on a rock farm with her family, who never laughed or smiled, and were constantly in a state of colorless sadness until she saw Rainbow Dash make a Sonic Rainboom, which immediately inspired her to throw a party. Without parties or friends, she'll go right back into the endless, cold, black abyss inside the heart of herself and everyone else in her naturally sad family tree.
</li></ul></li><li> In a more literal example, we have Krusty the Klown from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> Let's tell Krusty! That guy's hilarious! <br/><strong>Marge:</strong> I keep telling you, off-camera he's a desperately unhappy man.
</div><ul><li> This was also brought up in the episode "Tellow Subterfuge" when Krusty's supervisor asks him why he had become a clown. He simply responded with that he was meant to be one of the sad ones.
</li><li> Homer is a pretty good example of this trope. Though he's usually fairly exuberant, he's attempted suicide at least three times in the series, and during the early seasons, was often shown to be insecure about the way he looks, not to mention the stress related to his job. In the modern episodes, Homer's childhood was revealed with his parents constantly fighting and his father taking out his frustration out on him, bringing about Homer's constant eating habits.
</li><li> Bart can also be viewed as a sad clown. In "Lisa's Sax", when he was in kindergarten, he was verbally abused by the teacher that told him he would always fail in life when he simply struggled with naming the alphabet, causing him to get depressed and draw a picture of him being dead. However, he cheered up when he started making jokes; this can be further proven given that Bart is constantly abused by Homer and is bullied on a regular basis. At one point he was bullied by the town and attempted suicide in "The Boys of Bummer" as an attempt for forgiveness for failing to catch a baseball that caused the team to lose the match, but still makes jokes and pranks every episode.
</li><li> In the episode "Jaws Wired Shut", Bart tells Homer that he realized he had become a Class Clown when he was pressured to make a joke about the fact that their substitute teacher that day was named Mrs. Doody, and he has gone on since then, ruing that fact.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bart:</strong> So the substitute teacher comes in and says her name is Mrs. Doody, and everyone's looking at me like, "Take it, Bart. Run with it." Then it hits me. I've become a clown. A class clown. And it sickens me.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Randy Marsh of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> admits in the episode "You're Getting Old" that the reason for his crazy antics was because he was deeply unsatisfied with his mundane life, and was the first to overreact to different fads out of hope that it would give his life a little more meaning.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>: Spider-Man's wacky jokes and quirky personality are what he uses to shield him from a relentlessly unkind world.
</li><li> The hedonistic and womanizing behavior of Glenn Quagmire on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> is largely a way to cope with his failed relationship with Cheryl Tiegs.
<ul><li> In one episode, Quagmire has his penis bitten off by a shark in a motorboat accident, and at one point, attempts suicide through a ventriloquist routine where he has the puppet threaten him with a pistol. His friends hastily stepped in before he could ultimately pull the trigger.
</li><li> Peter Griffin may definitely fit the bill. He's had a father and a stepdad, neither one whom he'd formed a healthy, long-term relationship with. His Irish dad dumped his mother while he was in conception, and his stepdad was a religious fanatic who despised him until the day of his passing.
</li><li> In the episode, "Peter's Sister", it is revealed that Peter's bullying antics toward his daughter, Meg, is due to the humiliating abuse he got from his older sister.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackDynamite">Black Dynamite</a></em> explored this with when Dynamite had to help Richard Pryor. At one point going into a very scary in-depth look into the comedian's psyche. This was based on Pryor's real-life stint with cocaine (though oddly that took place in the 80s. The series is set in the 70s).

He loves animals and he manages to get along with almost everyone while eating Green Eggs &amp; Ham at every restaurant he stops by, trying to get a reluctant Guy to try it at every stop of their journey to Meepville. However, come Episode 10, and it turns out that the reason hes trained himself to become so likable with people is because his own mother left him at an orphanage, leaving him to grow up with no family of his own. The last thing she made for him was Green Eggs &amp; Ham for breakfast, and so hes constantly been eating said meal in hopes of someday finding his mother.</span>
</li><li> Amethyst of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> is extremely flippant and laid-back compared to Garnet or Pearl, but hides a <em>lot</em> of insecurity that only becomes apparent on episodes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">focus on her.</a>
<ul><li> And then there is Smoky Quartz, a combination of Amethyst and Steven who shares both of their fun-loving natures and is almost always smiling, but also shares both of their insecurities. When Smoky fails, the self-deprecating jokes are noticeably harsh.

Once he went solo he became famous for his debauched personal life and shocking onstage antics. His public persona is mostly an act, and in his personal life, he has often struggled with depression, anxiety, and alcoholism.

His backstory reveals a long history of extreme parental abuse; his mother has been mentioned as slamming his fingers in car doors as a child and cutting his tongue. In fact, he started doing impressions to please his mother to avoid the abuse. Alcoholism, cocaine addiction, and mental illness (he suffers from bipolar disorder, had a long history of self-harm and has sought treatment for schizophrenia) are also part of his backstory. Remarkably, he has still spoken very openly about it and is far more well-adjusted than anyone in his position should be expected to be.

While he played pranks and cracked up the audience on the show, at home he battled horrible drug addiction and alcoholism which became in his words "a matter of life and death". Even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">notoriously close cast-members</a> were unaware of how unhappy he was.

Good lord, the man just made you want to hug him and tell him "It will all be okay." His memoir "It Ain't Easy Bein' Me" is unbearably sad, detailing his emotionally abusive parents, his initial failure to break into show business, his lifelong struggle with depression, and his genuine self-hatred which he turned into self-deprecating one-liners.
</li><li> In a literal example, a fire at the Hartford circus in 1944 killed 167 people. The tragedy is often called "The Day The Clown Cried" (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheClownCried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheClownCried">infamous movie</a>), in reference to a picture of the aforementioned Weary Willie holding a bucket of water.

</li><li> Youtuber Ray William Johnson hasn't had an easy life. His father was a drug addict and Ray eventually disowned him after he stole from Ray's college (which was created with the help of Ray's grandparents) to buy drugs. When his father was dying, Ray refused to see him one last time. After learning this, his jokes about parents become a lot more sombre.

</li><li> Wayne Brady revealed that he had struggled with depression for a while in 2014. He kept it a secret for a while (and honestly, if you saw him on screen, you probably wouldn't be able to tell), but reached rock bottom after the suicide of Robin Williams, and at that point decided to come out with it. Fortunately, doing that seems to have helped him start to get better.
</li><li> Youtuber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LittleKuriboh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LittleKuriboh">LittleKuriboh</a>, known for his Abridged Series, revealed in 2014 to have been diagnosed with depression, which destroyed his creative output for a while. Since then, he has released a series of vlogs called "We're Still Here," chronicling his struggle while also giving positive life experiences, which is meant to help both him and others who have gone through the same thing. Doing that seems to have helped him get better.
<ul><li> He modified the format of "We're Still Here" to have some people he knows tell their stories of struggling with depression when he doesn't have anything to say. His first guest was voice actor/parody writer/singer Jesse Nowack, who revealed to have depression possibly caused by holding himself to extremely high standards due to having a military man for a stepfather. Therapy sessions, coming out of the closet, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">getting a tattoo of a fainting goat</a> have helped him start to get better.

Friends noted that despite his jovial persona on screen, in real life, he was not a happy person, and at times, could be extremely volatile. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">Having to stay in the closet</a> throughout his acting career probably didn't help.

However, his autobiography detailed an abusive childhood, a troubled marriage (which eventually ended in divorce), and a long struggle with depression (which resulted in a mental breakdown and a brief stay in a mental hospital). He had strained relationships with his family, to the point where his own children were not notified of his death in 2005.
</li><li> John Kennedy Toole was a renowned comedic stage performer for most of his life, winning much admiration from his fellow academics for his quick wit and skill at mimicry. He also suffered from serious depression and was continually haunted by his failure to get any of his novels published. His despair ultimately got the better of him, and he died of suicide at the age of 31. 11 years later, though, his mother successfully got his last novel published posthumously; that novel was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em>, which is widely considered one of the funniest novels ever written.

His declining health (both mentally and physically) forced him to take time out from March until September of 2015, and while he's on the mend his appearances on the main channel aren't as frequent as before.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley">Lewis Brindley</a> openly admitted that he was suffering from depression during a charity livestream in 2015.

This was mostly due to his homosexuality and beliefs of being the only one suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">Gayngst</a> (he frequently wrote that other gay men seemed to be dealing with it better than he was). He died in 1988 after overdosing on antidepressants, causing many to debate whether it was an accident or not. Adding to the speculation was the last entry in his diary before his death, which read, "Oh, what's the bloody point?"

He later turned to alcohol and also became addicted to morphine while recovering from a leg infection that threatened to take that leg entirely, which made his health even worse. All that combined with the Virginia Rappe scandal and it's a miracle he was able to stay positive during shootings.

In December 1972, only a month after he was first elected Senator of Delaware, his wife Neilia and their infant daughter Naomi were killed in an auto accident, with their sons Beau and Hunter hospitalized too. And then, in May 2015, Beau died battling cancer, which many believe was why Joe decided not to seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

He didn't stop there. After his two Super Bowl wins with the Oakland Raiders, Matuszak was bringing women into his locker room and was incarcerated for public stunts such as firing a gun at street signs and bringing his team out dancing and drinking on Bourbon Street, racking in fines from $1,000-$15,000. In his childhood, John lost his two brothers to cystic fibrosis, and his sister also had the disease long after childhood. When his family moved from Wisconsin to Oak Creek, his new classmates began ridiculing him and calling him a gawky beanpole. By the time his career ended, Matsuzak passed away from a painkiller addiction at 38.

Jeff got better after he met his second wife. Whether or not his sadness is long-term is to be considered.

Acquaintances often described him as melancholy and willing to give up on his problems instead of truly dealing with them in his bleaker moods. And although he managed to leave his final wife, it was around that time that he began to slowly succumb to progressive supranuclear palsy, leading to his premature death at the age of 66. It's not for nothing that Barbara Paskin's authorized biography of him sometimes bears the subtitle <em>The Melancholy Clown</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardPryor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardPryor">Richard Pryor</a> struggled with drug addiction, culminating in a 1980 freebasing accident in which he suffered second- and third-degree burns, which his daughter Rain theorized was actually a suicide attempt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers">Joan Rivers</a> struggled with depression after the suicide of her husband Edgar Rosenberg and subsequent estrangement from her daughter Melissa.
</li><li> Writer and movie critic Mikey Neumann, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MoviesWithMikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MoviesWithMikey">Movies with Mikey</a></em> fame, is famous for his outgoing personality and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">surreal</a> sense of humor, and generally maintains the public persona of a lovably weird goofball. He's also been battling Multiple Sclerosis for most of his career, and ultimately left his job at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware">Gearbox Software</a> as a result of complications from the disease; among other things, he was hospitalized for over a week in 2011 after collapsing from a sudden stroke. He occasionally lampshades this in his video essays, noting that he enjoys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">approaching difficult subjects in a humorous manner</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BoBurnham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BoBurnham">Bo Burnham</a>. He even wrote a song about it; the song contains the line, "Come and watch the skinny kid with a steadily declining mental health, and laugh as he attempts to give you what he cannot give himself."
</li><li> Harrison Laine of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMusicVideoShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMusicVideoShow">The Music Video Show</a> made a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/OfByCu4kEIQ">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that reveals that he is this, where he explains a suicide attempt. Looking at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CreatorBreakdown/WebOriginal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CreatorBreakdown/WebOriginal">Creator Breakdown</a> page, all but 4 seasons have been made out of anger, depression or suicidal thoughts.
</li><li> Brazilian comedian Fausto Fanti struggled with severe depression, which led him to ultimately commit suicide.
</li><li> As seen above, it's very common for people afflicted with mental illnesses (especially bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, and OCD) to actually have a great sense of humor. It sounds contradictory, but mental illness isn't all sadness and darkness. One thing that is common to many mental illnesses is severe self-doubt about your value as a person. Cracking jokes and making people laugh can temporarily ease some of those feelings. Not to mention that humor is a very effective coping mechanism; if one were to observe interactions between patients in a mental hospital, one would hear a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">Gallows Humor</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a>, leavened with a surprising amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">Sophisticated as Hell</a>.
</li><li> A common stereotype of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassClown">Class Clown</a> is they use humor as coping with things such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a>, and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">Friendless Background</a>. Of course this isn't always the case, but see any of the countless examples above for proof that it exists.
</li><li> Hungarian stand-up comedian and cabaret singer Géza Hofi was is one of the country's most beloved humorists, even after his death in 2004. He made his career during the second, softer phase of communism/state socialism, following the 1956 revolution, which, despite it's failure, forced the new leadership to enact a number of changes. János Kádár, leader of the People's Republic of Hungary after the revolution (which he helped the Soviets to crush, albeit out of fear that they would do it anyway, but with worse penalties for the nation, because of the government's "straying from the cause"), was a fan of Hofi, but, more importantly, considered him "the valve on the country's ass". Hofi's performances often showcased the absurdities and awkwardness of the system, allowing people to laugh at their situation. He even often jokingly addressed the government spies and snitches in the audience. Despite this, he wasn't a happy man, having spent many nights in prison for his satirical performances (albeit always released quickly). Like many "clowns" and humorists", he originally aspired to be an actor, having an excellent singing voice and vocal talent, however, he found himself railroaded into the role of "the regime's court jester". Now, combine this with a declining health and being near-constantly watched by the secret police...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaredPadalecki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaredPadalecki">Jared Padalecki</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> fame has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of his 20-year career and adult life. His giggly, jokestery, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug">Cuddle Bug</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a>, occasionally-bordering-on-manic public persona camouflages it pretty well, but it was exactly this that made some fans suspect that he was having troubles with mental illness even before he went public in 2013, with some even comparing it to Robin Williams.
</li><li> Anthony Field of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a> has spent almost thirty years educating and entertaining children through music and also television, but has suffered many hardships in his life including numerous family deaths, health problems (including a battle with meningitis) and has also been open about his battle with depression.
</li><li> The Jewish people as a whole. Given their long history of persecution, it is perhaps unsurprising that humor plays such a prominent role in Jewish culture, or that they've produced so many comedians.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> creator/comic writer/screenwriter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> is a genuinely funny guy who is well-known for his extremely quick-witted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> tendencies both on social media and in person. While he'd always talked in vague terms about an unhappy early life, his 2019 memoir <em>Becoming Superman</em> laid bare the depths of the hell his childhood was, including domestic, emotional, sexual and verbal abuse, child molestation, rape, incest, attempted murder, suspected infanticide, and attempted suicide. He is still relatively sane, by the way, if a bit asocial.
</li><li> The legendary <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Williams">Bert Williams<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was <em>the</em> biggest Black entertainer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Famed for his comic timing, witty songs, hilarious body language, and overall skill, Williams rose to fame in an era of total racial segregation; he was the first Black person to headline a Broadway show and a bestselling recording artist. But for all that, he suffered deeply from the intense racism of his day, and while he tried to deal with it in style, some surviving anecdotes and records reveal his deep pain. Other white cast members often protested his appearances or refused to work with him, and he often had to don blackface and act in a stereotypical manner to make white audiences laugh. W.C. Fields (himself a famously Sad Clown) described Williams as "the funniest man I ever saw—and the saddest man I ever knew."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a> is one of America's greatest comic talents, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> fondly remembered as one of the seminal sitcoms of all time. But Ball herself suffered from deep self-esteem issues and was convinced that she was not funny. As such, she often rehearsed to the point of obsession to make sure everything was "perfect" and could spend hours trying to nail down a single gag. Her famously tempestuous marriage to Desi Arnaz, who often fooled around with other women, did not help matters, especially because they were playing husband and wife on the show, so there was great public pressure to keep up appearances despite their frequent fighting. When someone watches <em>The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour</em> (a sequel series to <em>I Love Lucy</em> with the same characters), they might notice that Lucy's eyes are puffy and voice is hoarse—because Ball had been crying just before filming. It's understandable, as Lucy and Desi divorced the <em>day after</em> shooting on the <em>Comedy Hour</em> wrapped.
</li><li> Per Gessle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Roxette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Roxette">Roxette</a> cracks a lot of jokes- during interviews, in social media posts, onstage, and even in his lyrics sometimes. This combined with the often-upbeat sound of his music means he must be happy all the time, right? Nope- he's had a lot of emotional issues, including but not limited to losing his father when he was 18, losing several family members (along with his wife's parents) in the 2010s, and losing his bandmate, with whom he was close friends, at the very end of that decade.
</li><li> The legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> actor Govinda, whose talent for comedy earned him comparisons to Charlie Chaplin and Jim Carrey, had a reputation for being temperamental offscreen. This may be explained by the personal losses he endured (his first daughter died in infancy, and both of his parents suffered long illnesses and died while he was at the peak of success) or by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">extreme workaholism in order to financially support his working class extended family</a>. In later years he also expressed frustration at being stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyGhetto">Comedy Ghetto</a> and has pointed to the dramas <em>Hatya</em> and <em>Swarg</em> as his favorites of his own movies.
