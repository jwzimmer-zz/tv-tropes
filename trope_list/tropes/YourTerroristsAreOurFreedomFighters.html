</div></div><p>The word "terrorist" doesn't have a single, universally-accepted definition. The most commonly accepted definition is "a person who uses violence to achieve a political end," but that label is enormously problematic; by that definition, any people who engage in a war could be accurately described as terrorists.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dyol');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dyol" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dyol');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some people try to qualify it by stating that terrorism is <em>unsanctioned</em> violence to achieve a political end, but then you start getting into questions of "Sanctioned <em>by whom</em>?" and then you're back at square one.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Lelouch grapples with this issue. A large portion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La RÃ©sistance</a> that existed before Lelouch entered the scene as Zero were pretty squarely on the wrong side of this - in the first episode, a news broadcast is shown about a terrorist bombing that killed 8 Britannians and 51 "others". While the immediately noticeable thing is how unfair it is that the 8 Britannians are given so much more regard than the other victims, there's also the fact that these "freedom fighters" killed 51 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystanders</a> from their own people. Lelouch debuts his Black Knights with the rescue of a group of Britannian civilian hostages from one of these sorts of groups, promising to defend the weak from those who would abuse power, "whether they be Britannians, or Elevens". Furthermore, he sees that bombings like the one shown in the first episode are petty, and do nothing to accomplish the goal of freedom. However, as he goes along, he finds it hard to follow his own code of not involving civilians (see stages 11-14) - and he's surrounded by people who tell him he shouldn't bother. His immense guilt over the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> situation in the end of season one has him labelling himself a terrorist after that. But the series does explore this issue and search for the place where "resisting the empire" no longer justifies sacrificing civilians.
<ul><li> The side manga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassOzTheReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassOzTheReflection">Oz the Reflection</a> reveals the existence of Peace Mark, a worldwide terrorist faction that hates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> just as much as Zero does.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens in multiple Gundam series, such as the AEUG and Karaba of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, and the League Militaire of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a></em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>'s first season averts this, as Celestial Being don't claim to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La RÃ©sistance</a>. Season 2, however, has Celestial Being allied with Katharon, a Karaba-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> organization who fit the trope better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>'s five protagonists of Operation: Meteor were sent by Colonists against the oppressive Oz of Earth. Many of their attacks felt like terrorist movements, until we learned what they were targeting was in fact very specific. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">Granted some collateral damage.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, the third and fourth World Wars have left Japan with a large population of refugees (probably Chinese and Korean), who live in camps made of ruined and abandoned cities enclosed by fences and guarded by the military. Forced to live in poverty and without any place to go, many of them resolve to take hostages, assassinate political officials, and perform suicide bombings to force the government to give them a new home. In the second season, one of the two main antagonists is a Japanese man who becomes one of the rebels' greatest leaders and is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">a hero for the refugees</a>, but the country's top terrorist by the government. Given that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> deals heavily with conspiracies, things are a lot more complicated, though.
<ul><li> Then there are the Individual Eleven who claim to represent the will of the mainstream Japanese populace, and pursue "refugee liberation" (read: "kick them out of the country!"), who also commit terrorist acts in the name of their cause. In the first episode of the second season the Major in turn compares the Section 9 to a terrorist organization, since they're a secret armed group that lacks governmental recognition or supervisionâ€”they do get the said recognition later in the same episode, though.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1r22z');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1r22z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1r22z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was because Section Nine had been officially disbanded at the end of the first season, and thus they were still lacking official government sanction, even if they were ready to hit the ground running. Legally speaking, any actions taken without government sanction would have been illegal (e.g. The Major hacking the terrorists, the use of lethal force would be murder, etc).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Magi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Magi">Magi</a></em> has several examples due to the socio political theme of the story. The Fog troupe a rebel group in Balbad are led by the hero himself at some point. They wish to overthrow the oppressive king but the true leader is ready to commit acts that endanger civilians.
<ul><li> Then we have Al Thamen, that is an actual world (read universe) scale terrorist organization. Their goal is pure freedom since they want to overthrow destiny itself. The problem is that the very way to do so involves creating wars and causing the deaths of billions...
</li></ul></li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em> are considered as criminals before and after they were framed. However a number of them are good people at heart. When a princess decides to seek them out to save her kingdom, they become this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> plays with this concept a bit. The main characters are pirates who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">don't do pirate like things</a>, instead taking out other pirates and corrupt organizations/local governments, but this hasn't stopped them from being labeled as highly dangerous pirates by the world government (it doesn't help that some enjoy being called pirates) and heavily feared by most citizens, although the citizens they've helped out seem really grateful and forever in their debt. The fact that a few of them were already on the run from the world government for political reasons (they knew something the world government didn't want the public to know) doesn't help.
<ul><li> Then there's the Revolutionaries, who directly challenge the World Government, and within six years, have gained from strength to strength, to the point that its leader is considered "The Worst Criminal In The World". Most of what we know about them has been mentioned by other characters, and we have not seen much on the organisation as a whole, what its aim are, or even the aftermath of their actions. However, individual members of them seem to be decent enough folk.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown">Guilty Crown</a></em> features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La RÃ©sistance</a> "Funeral Parlor," and the government GHQ.

Lelouch adjusts his methods of dealing with them accordingly.
<ul><li> The small resistance force whose members include Kallen, Ohgi, Tamaki, and the late Naoto is also the most idealistic one. Lelouch is perfectly willing to grant them amnesty, providing they don't cause any more trouble since he wants to recruit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Kallen</a>.

Lelouch is willing to let them go into exile in China since he wants to use them at a later date. He makes an exception for the JLF member who ordered an attack on civilians, including Lelouch's former schoolmates and sister Euphemia. Lelouch considers that man to be nothing more than a cowardly terrorist, and he demands the man's head.
</li><li> The Kenshiki Faction is the worst of the lot. A group of zealots led by a foreigner hating bigot and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Entitled Bastard</a> who are willing to kill hundreds of civilians, even their fellow Japanese, to get their way.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ImHereToHelp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ImHereToHelp">I'm Here to Help</a></em>, the group is portrayed as a bunch of noble freedom fighters trying to overthrow a corrupt government.

</li><li> A whole host of groups show up in the later novels, mostly single world movements in the Talbott Cluster violently skeptical of coming under the Manticoran imperial umbrella or looking to overthrow client governments of the Solarian League.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumaneTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumaneTyranny">Humane Tyranny</a></em>, those in the Population Reduction Agency don't know much about the rebel alliance, but when speculating, they refer to them as terrorists, and law enforcement agencies might share similar views, at least officially. But considering that the rebels are trying to stop the government from killing one innocent person a night, they would not see themselves as such and neither would most civilians.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InCryptid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InCryptid">InCryptid</a></em> novels, the Covenant of St Giles sees themselves as crusaders protecting the world from cryptids. Sapient cryptids, and the Healy-Price family that makes up the main cast, regard them as a pack of genocidal terrorists out to murder anything they consider to have not been on Noah's Ark (which they don't exactly have a manifest from), including non-human sentients who can make perfectly decent neighbors if you don't try to kill them for no real reason. Granted, some cryptid species <em>are</em> dangerous and need to be dealt with (or at least isolated from human settlements), so the Covenant could be heroic if they weren't so indiscriminate about their targets.
</li><li> The Varden in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> are a very good example of this trope. They make it very clear they consider themselves freedom fighters, and the empire as harmful, but the Empire's supporters (and pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">villainization</a> Murtagh) occasionally call them out for their less than stellar behavior, so obviously some people think of them as terrorists.

</li><li> In the later chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePoisonwoodBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePoisonwoodBible">The Poisonwood Bible</a></em>, this frequently comes up in arguments between the pro-colonialist Rachel, and her sister Leah, who is married to a (mostly non-violent) freedom fighter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> when he thinks he is joining the Brotherhood resistance group Winston Smith vows to do anything, even throw acid in the face of a child, to advance the cause of rebellion. O'Brien later plays his words back to him to mock his belief that he is a noble freedom fighter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em>, there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helm Cleaver</span>, which is certainly treated as a terrorist group by Zion. Truth to be told, looking at their methods Â— assassination, blowing up churches, leaving messages on places of murder Â— it's hard not to draw parallels between them and real-life terrorists. The main reason they're sympathetic is because their target, the Church under Zhaspahr Clyntahn, has started an unjustified world war to annihilate two nations purely because they irritate the Grand Inquisitor on general principle, including suicide bombings, the assassination of his own allies so he can blame the deaths on his enemies, setting off massive riots that result in the rape, murder and/or starvation of millions, and having prisoners of war (and his political opponents) publicly tortured to death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowspawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowspawn">The Shadowspawn</a></em>, the vampires' human helpers consider the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Brotherhood</a> to be little better than terrorists, since the latter consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">them</a></em> traitors to humanity, and <em>very</em> expendable in their war against their masters.
</li><li> As befitting the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> has a few examples. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">Brotherhood Without Banners</a>, for instance, began as an army meant to bring Gregor Clegane to justice for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">raping and pillaging the Riverlands</a>. Then the one who set them to their task fell out of power, while those to whom Clegane owes allegiance gained it and promptly declared them outlaws. The Brotherhood then shifts goals to protecting the peasantry at large, which puts them at odds with those in power, who desire the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> to continue indiscriminately. After the war is over, several nobles are noted to be utterly clueless why the smallfolk protect and collaborate with the Brotherhood, rarely or never acknowledging the horrendous crimes afflicted against the defenseless lower classes.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Sons of the Harpy</a> are a reversed example, in that, from the perspective of the POV characters, they are seen in a completely negative light. However, taking into account that their city has been attacked and taken over by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside-Context Problem</a>, who executed over a hundred of their ruling class and is now attempting to impose radical reforms based on completely foreign values, the group's goals become, if not justified (they are, after all, murdering innocent people and attempting to reinstate a government based almost entirely around slavery), than at least a bit more understandable. Exemplified when a boy comes before Daenerys asking for justice for his family, who were raped and murdered by their slaves; having pardoned all crimes by both sides, she must deny it, and mentions that he will almost certainly join the Sons of the Harpy for the sake of a (from his point of view) fairly just cause.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> novel <em>Sacrifice</em>, Luke Skywalker's own son acknowledges a lot of innocent people died when the Death Star(s) exploded. Luke himself noted that it had more than a million people on board, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">not counting the droids</a>. Let's not even go into the <em>prisoners</em> being held on that battle station when it blew (Leia was a prisoner there, and Luke and Han had Chewbacca pose as a prisoner). This is also acknowledged by Luke himself in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Jedi Academy Trilogy</a></em>, as well as in the standalone novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em> which follows some of the contractors and other people doing ordinary jobs like barkeeping that happen to be on a planet killing space station. Numerous other books also allude in passing to the rebels not being universally on the heroic side of this trope; Face Loran's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Wraith Squadron</a></em>, for example, has him being kidnapped and marked for execution by one such group <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">when he was a child</a></em> simply because he starred in a series of Imperial propaganda films. His kidnappers were extremists the Rebel Alliance expelled.

There's a point where Kira finds the Cardassian file on herself, and she's actually upset that they only looked at her personally as a minor nuisance.

In many Yellow Zones, the Brotherhood are a source of order and relief from all the effects of Tiberium, inspired by promises of Divination and later on Ascension.

<ul><li> The trope also goes in reverse: in the aforementioned Nod-controlled zones, GDI are often painted as terrorists who abandoned the majority of the world as detailed above. Nevertheless, the Blue Zones and those Yellow Zones that GDI can begin the restoration process for look up to GDI as a hope for the future. It is worth noting that canonically, not only has GDI never targeted civilians deliberately (in contrast to the Brotherhood who have whole missions dedicated to the concept), but still tries to help those who need it no matter how many times Nod attacks their aid convoys. This came up as early as the first game; one Nod mission is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> where you attack civilian settlements with captured GDI equipment, and GDI has its funding cut during the investigation of that and other news stories (some completely fabricated by Nod-controlled outlets).

<ul><li> This trope also ended up biting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Majestic 12</a> in the ass: they created the Daedalus AI with the purpose of cracking down on any group that could oppose their rule, which included all terrorist groups.

<ul><li> The titular Sons Of Liberty (MGS2) call themselves freedom fighters. They certainly are terrorists too. Same for FoxHound.
</li><li> Philanthropy started as a UN organization; they presumably kept that backing because Snake is very very good at what he does and it's not hard to imagine that their attacks were executed without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">any</a> casualties: Snake points out at the beginning of the second game that Philanthropy is recognized, but still "fringe", in that if they get caught, they're not allowed to claim that they were working for the UN. However, Snake is framed for sinking the <em>USS Discovery</em> and killing the US Marines on board (though the official story is that he sank a tanker of crude oil), and that gets Philanthropy kicked to the curb by the UN and turns them <em>into</em> an illegal terrorist organization. Snake was on the <em>Discovery</em> only to get evidence that the US military was developing a new Metal Gear, which would blow the lid off the US government's claims to the contrary, but the whole plot was a set up to incriminate Snake as a terrorist<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3k2k8');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3k2k8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3k2k8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Patriots set him up to take the fall and take him out of the equation, as he was a wild card that they couldn't properly control, and knew too much</span></span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> set up a development facility to start production on Arsenal Gear.</span>
<ul><li> On the other hand, Solid Snake himself does not deny that he is a terrorist as well, when Raiden pointed out that what he and Philanthropy is doing is more comparable to that than grassroots resistance, meaning they may have done some much less innocent stuff to get rid of Metal Gear in the past. Now, the Patriots are an interesting variation: Although they rule the country and are also implied to be the very essence of American ideology, they also frequently stage Terrorist attacks <em>on their own soil</em> and frame the "official" terrorist group for committing them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note48s2i');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note48s2i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note48s2i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that this is actually a legitimate training tool, called a "Red Team", which stages various terrorist attacks without warning to test readiness for such an attack. However, Dead Cell was sold out by the Patriots into staging a <em>real</em> terrorist attack, under the veil of a training exercise, and then condemned for it by having them declared rogue. Their anger with their parent organizations is therefore understandable (though Fat Man was <em>actually</em> crazy, and Vamp isn't much better)</span>. Metal Gear Solid 4 also implies that it was actually the Patriots who rammed Arsenal Gear onto Manhattan, presumably due to GW being corrupted.

In fact, most of the early missions consist of legitimate work like scanning freighters for contraband and defending military installations from attack. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningScroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningScroll">Opening Scroll</a> and cutscene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em> specifically refer to "Rebel terrorists" and "Rebel insurgents."

Those stories told from the Rebel perspective are likely to include Alliance ships named after idealsâ€”"Independence," "Liberty," "Freedom"â€”while enemy ships have names with definite negative connotationsâ€”"Inquisitor," for example, or even "Eviscerator." If, however, the protagonists fly for the Empire, suddenly all the Star Destroyers have names like "Protector" or "Stalwart", while the ships of their Rebel opponents have non-evocative names like "Gopher" or "Yander".

Due to the "Cold War" between the Empire and Republic, proxy wars are fought with both sides aiding bomb-happy terrorists to fight the other side on their occupied worlds. The Consular even picks one of these terrorists up as a companion. He's a hardened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a> who sees no problem with bombing (Imperial) civilian targets or shooting people who worked for the Empire under duress; Imps die, he's happy. The Bounty Hunter and Smuggler can end up being this trope as well; the Hunter gets legally branded a terrorist after the Empire disavows a mercenary job you did for them (the Mandalorians are in your corner but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">Not Helping Your Case</a>), while the Smuggler is an outright pirate with the minimal fig leaf of a Privateer license (and that's the light side version).

This goes as far as having the <em>same characters</em> be honorable and just when they're on your side, and psychopathic maniacs when they fight against you. For example, when you play for the Aeon, the Princess is genuinely concerned about enemy civilian population and instructs her commanders to avoid needless casualties, whereas in the UEF campaign she clearly tries to brainwash you and her commanders do the standard Evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">cleansing</a> the entire galaxy of unbelievers.

And since the Dyrenell Empire has neither the responsibility nor desire to cede any of its lands, his new nation can only survive through forcible annexation of existing lands and villages and is thus inherently a declaration of war. Euden reconciles this by only targeting towns and villages already in active rebellion against the empire for liberation, but he nonetheless develops a reputation as a seditious terrorist.

Another variation shows up in the second season, with the resistance of a recently fallen city of Omashu. Their introduction is composed of executing an assassination on the Fire Nation governor's family. But remember <em>they are good guys</em>.
<ul><li> The Equalists in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>. They see themselves as fighting back against benders who have been oppressing them, but they undercut their own moral authority by indiscriminately bombing Republic City and by targeting, of all groups, the last four airbenders (three of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">children</a>). On the other hand, they try not to kill anyone, seeking only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">depower</a> the benders.
</li><li> Also the Red Lotus. They see themselves as freeing the world from corrupt leaders and oppression, and they temporarily convince the citizens of Ba Sing Se of that. Pretty much everyone else sees their acts are extremely ruthless anarchistic violence, and after their coup the entire Earth Kingdom descended into total chaos and then was conquered by a tyrant, eradicating any sympathy the rest of the world might have had.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Bullock:</strong> You gave away state secrets to a terrorist!? <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> <em>(sheepishly)</em> Freedom fighter?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots">Challenge of the GoBots</a>,</em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Fi-Tor</a> is captured by the heroes, he appears rather noble, and clearly believes in his own side's cause. When he tries to destroy the transport ship carrying him away for interrogation, which would kill both him and the crew manning it, the heroes call him a maniac. He responds, "You mean 'patriot!'"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Season 2 Mandalore trilogy, the Separatists and the Death Watch are explicitly counting on this trope: Death Watch commits terrorist bombings on the planet, to make it appear that the Mandalorian goverment can't handle the situation on its own, so the Republic would send clone troops to keep peace. This however would turn the terrorists into heroes in the eyes of the public, destabilizing the pacifist government, and resulting in the rebirth of the Mandalorian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">warrior culture.</a>
</li><li> Later in Season 5, this trope is Obi-Wan's main reason to object against Anakin's plan to train a group of rebels on Onderon. For some irony, one of those rebels is a younger Saw Gerrera, who would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">later</a> go on to form one of the more brutal rebel groups fighting against the Galactic Empire.
</li></ul></li><li> A more popular portrayal of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> lately is with Cybertron as a stagnant, caste based society. The Decepticons are to some extent fighting for freedom and a new, fair order. Unfortunately thanks to Megatron, it all got out of hand with many joining simply for the pleasure of opportunities for sadism and destruction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a>'s</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Queen Chrysalis</a> has undertones of this, since her primary goal is to feed her Changeling subjects. Fans tend to exaggerate the trope and run with it, justifying making her out into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> just because of that while conveniently ignoring the fact that the Queen is also sadistic, cruel, possessive and just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">not a good person by any stretch of the imagination</a>. She would later be revealed as exploiting the changelings for her own benefit, as while they need to feed, Chrysalis would horde most of the gathered love, leaving most of them starving, and that by sharing love, the changelings' ever present hunger could be satiated without harming anyone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, Rick and many of his friends are labelled as terrorists by the galactic federation. What exactly their crimes were is never revealed. Rick simply put it to his family "They think they control the galaxy, I disagree." His friend Bird Person outright calls some of their actions "atrocities", although he doesn't elaborate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rick eventually surrenders himself to the federation after he sees what his actions are doing to his family...then he destroys the federation from the inside.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Jasper's motivation implies this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She seeks revenge on Rose Quartz for killing their superior- Pink Diamond- during the Earth rebellion. Rose and Pearl launching guerrilla warfare on Blue Diamond's court and Bismuth's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">Sociopathic Soldier</a> habits support this idea.</span>
</li><li> The eponymous "Freedom Fighters" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> are unquestionably fighting for a good cause, since Dr. Robotnik overthrew the benevolent Mobius government via a coup that no one but himself was backing, but because they are fighting a tyrannical empire that has eyes everywhere, they must resort to sabotage and other methods of guerrilla warfare that would likely be labeled a terroristic act by an outsider. At least all their targets are mechanical so no living creature is being hurt, and contrasted against Robotink indiscriminately capturing and enslaving Mobians as transformed machines.
