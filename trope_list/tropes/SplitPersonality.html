While typically depicted as rare and often misdiagnosed due to lack of education among clinicians, the disorder is actually estimated to occur in 1 to 3% of the population worldwide, placing it on a similar scope to autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</p><p>A simplified (maybe simplistic) explanation by psychologists: the condition is thought to sometimes result when a child/teen copes with abuse by convincing himself that it's happening to someone else; as such, the trigger is generally some experience the child/teen is trying to dissociate from by means of creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">an "alter ego" who gets put in charge</a>. (The multiple personalities form the source of the disorder's original name, "Multiple Personality Disorder"; it was changed because the new name provides a better explanation of motivation. Note that without receiving psychological counseling, the symptoms will carry over into adulthood. The individual has no control (at least initially) over when the personalities "switch" and may not initially remember what happens to him while they are switched. To put all that in Tropese: you go to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyPlace">Happy Place</a> while some poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> has to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> — so stereotypically, the personality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">who has to deal with it is not a nice person</a>...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>But that's not entertaining enough (although it's formed the basis for hundreds of popular nonfiction books on the subject), so television does it differently, and in several different ways. Two (or more) personalities may be sharing memory or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia">not sharing memory</a> or have access to each other's memory as external to their own in symmetric or asymmetric fashion, they can switch at will or involuntarily and be in clear war or some form of pact. It even may be the very same personality (i.e. having the very same mind, memory, and desires), but changing 'behavior mode' between several clearly distinctive states. Ironically, this is closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for what real multiples report experiencing.
</p><p>Characters with a split personality are surprisingly common in fiction, but most of them don't quite match the textbook definition of DID. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">In older media</a>, it will often be called "schizophrenia" even by psychologist characters, despite the fact that they are <em>completely different disorders</em>. In schizophrenia, the person experiences auditory and sometimes visual or tactile hallucinations. (The word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">schizophrenia</a> literally means "split mind," because a main symptom is scattered, unconnected thoughts.)

Flashbacks in an early issue of <em>Alpha Flight</em> revealed that the "Aurora" personality split off from "Jeanne-Marie" after she was severely beaten by the nuns who were raising her. Originally, only "Aurora" had superpowers (not surprisingly, since the nuns had beaten Jeanne-Marie for telling them she could fly — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">she could, but they assumed she was lying</a>), and if too much stress caused her to revert to the "Jeanne-Marie" personality in a crisis, it could cause serious problems. In her more recent appearances, she's shown signs of having a third, unnamed, personality, whose main characteristic is being psychopathically violent.

The Void is a pure evil, manipulative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> in semi-human form, strongest at night or in the Negative Zone, and is often described as akin to the Angel of Death.

Despite being the most well-known example, he is also an abnormal one, because as Two-Face, both of his personas, good and evil, are "on" at the same time (Usually. Two-Face is a huge case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>). Coincidentally, his symptoms sometimes imply actual Schizophrenia, which doesn't exactly help clear the confusion people have about the two conditions.
</li><li> A few comics have suggested that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> has multiple personality disorder, switching from a harmless prankster to serious threat and everything in-between. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> in particular is fond of the idea that the Joker has a unique condition where he has no "true" personality, but continually reinvents himself through multiple "superpersonas". (It's suggested by Dr Adams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em>, and the text story "The Clown at Midnight" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Grant Morrison's Batman</a></em> is largely a character study of it happening.)
</li><li> Even Batman himself has been accused of this. By day, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Bruce Wayne</a>. Put on the costume, and he's a completely different person. It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">been argued</a> that the Batman persona is his "true" personality, and Bruce Wayne is the mask he hides behind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> revealed that Batman, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">prepares for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">everything</a></em>, deliberately cultivated a back-up personality should the Bruce Wayne/Batman persona be incapacitated.
</li><li> Arnold Wesker is a mild-mannered ventriloquist, and is <em>utterly convinced</em> that his psychopathic mobster alter ego, Scarface, manifests through his ventriloquist's dummy, rather than his own brain. Scarface often agrees with this, and the split personality's dependence on the puppet is so strong that the personality doesn't manifest outright when the puppet is missing or destroyed, although poor Arnold then feels a compulsion to replace it.
<ul><li> Some stories imply that Wesker is <em>correct</em>, and the doll really is possessed by an evil spirit or spirits (in his last appearance, Wesker dies and the doll is burned... and gets up and walks before collapsing). And a couple suggest that Wesker is just acting and the doll is really just a ruse to convince everyone he is crazy. Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> is sometimes accused of being, but given some of the stuff Scarface has put him through <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2vfyt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2vfyt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2vfyt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At one point Wesker replaced Scarface with a sock puppet; Scarface returned and <em>they shot each other</em>, leaving Wesker with bullet ridden hands</span>, Wesker would arguably be <em>even worse.</em>
</li><li> When Wesker replaces the Scarface dummy with a different puppet, the alternate personality is often different, and usually milder mannered.

The "Mary" personality is a timid, quiet, pacifist; her "Typhoid Mary" persona is adventurous, lustful, and violent; her "Bloody Mary" personality is sadistic, brutal, and hates all men. Typhoid was so different than Mary, that even Daredevil was, at first, unable to tell they were the same person, even with his enhanced senses. (It seemed that the change even affected her body odor somehow.)
</li><li> Shasti from Adam Warren's version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> deliberately engineered with four personalities for different tasks.
</li><li> Grant Morrison's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a></em> featured, among other characters, Kay Challis, also known as Crazy Jane, who had no less than 64 separate personalities, each with its own name and function, and after a "gene-bomb" was detonated during an alien invasion of Earth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">each with its own superhuman ability</a>. Ms. Challis and members of her group were based on Truddi Chase and her Troops, authors of the 1986 book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenRabbitHowls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhenRabbitHowls">When Rabbit Howls</a></em>.

For the record, those personalities are: Standard, overburdened teenager; "Spy", analytical and task-oriented; "Soldier", aggressive and combat proficient; "Nihilist", rebellious and troublemaking; and "Little Gemma", essentially Copycat as she was at age 6. Ivana actually points out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych">Hollywood Psych</a> at work, saying that Gem's condition doesn't resemble any case of Dissociative Identity Disorder she's ever read about. She theorizes it has something to do with her Gen-Factor mutating an existing psychological disorder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> originally had a "Psychological Profile" for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Zartan</a> that describes him as an "Extreme paranoid schizophrenic. Grows into various multiple personalities to such an extent that the original personality becomes buried and forgotten." Mental health groups complained, however, and Zartan's psychological profile had been dropped in later reprints of his general profile.
<ul><li> One of Zartan's Dreadnoks is Road Pig, real name Donald DeLuca. This isn't mentioned in his toy profiles, but in the comics "Road Pig" and "Donald" are depicted as two distinct personalities: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> thug and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a> sophisticate, respectively. They're aware of each other, and though there's not much they agree on, they both love wanton destruction and Zartan's sister Zarana. And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a> to all the Dreadnoks, chocolate covered donuts and grape soda.

At the climax of the issue, Chance discovers his stalker was... himself. His subconscious desire to shock his original personality out of "hiding" caused him to create an alternate identity to endanger himself and his wife. She doesn't quite believe that he had <em>no</em> control over this and leaves him. He cries when he finds the mask of the stalker's face — as he puts it, he's so good be fools himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Bruce Banner is a different person when transformed into the Hulk. The comics take it to extremes, with different versions of the Hulk with different personalities: in addition to the traditional "Savage Hulk", there also developed a sneaky, amoral version called Joe Fixit (who was grey, like in the Hulk's first appearance). Eventually, the personalities were integrated into the "Merged Hulk", but this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> to be just another personality, the Professor (who had Banner's brainpower, Fixit's cunning, and most of Savage Hulk's strength).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3k4e8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3k4e8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3k4e8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Professor seems to be based on Billy Milligan's ability to voluntarily integrate everyone in his system; he called this state "the Teacher". Other multiples report being able to integrate at will and <em>don't</em> recommend it, agreeing with Billy that "the whole is less than the sum of the parts."</span>
<ul><li> Two other personalities in Bruce's lineup are the Devil Hulk, a reptilian creature that lacks any sense of guilt, and the Green Scar, who combines Fixit's cunning with the Savage's strength, and over time develops to become possibly the strongest Hulk incarnation of all.
</li><li> Some have theorized that the Hulk is — and always has been — an embodiment of pent-up rage and aggression that Banner had felt all his life prior to the accident, mostly stemming from the abuse he and his mother suffered at the hands of his father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Who Bruce killed by accident, but later admitted it <em>might</em> have not been an accident.</span> In short, Banner and the Hulk may be more alike than Banner is willing to admit.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hulk's son Skaar also has a split personality; "normal" Skaar is a Conan-style barbarian, while "puny" Skaar is an adolescent boy who hates his other self for his savage deeds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BettyRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BettyRoss">Betty Ross</a> as Red She-Hulk. The degree to which she retains control over Red She-Hulk varies a lot. Sometimes it's just an angrier Betty, while at others it is an entirely different persona whom she fears losing control over.
</li><li> When M.O.D.O.K. placed Doctor Samson under mind control it produced a split personality. This led to a powerless Leonard who was defined as the good one and an evil Samson whose abilities are greater than She-Hulk's.

The Threebot version takes this a little far; her entire civilisation consists of triplicates of the same person. The one/three who are members of the Legion, however, have had so many different experiences from the others that the rest won't let them rejoin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight">Moon Knight</a></em> started off with the gimmick of having multiple secret identities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, this became a dissociative identity disorder, with Marc Spector, Jake Lockley, Steven Grant, and Moon Knight all being distinct personae. He also sometimes believes himself to be in communication with the Egyptian god who gave him his powers, but that might be another personality. Currently, the story is that he really <em>is</em> possessed by Khonshu, and his mind makes sense of this by constructing alternate personalities around Khonshu's various forms.
</li><li> The DCU also has had two different <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RoseAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RoseAndThorn">Rose And Thorn</a></em> characters over the years, one whose Thorn persona was a villain, and a later one whose Thorn is a hero.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> has the Green Goblin, who sometimes suffers from this, though in an inversion the real persona <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> can be just as evil as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> sometimes showed signs of this in his career. There were times when his original, timid, benevolent personality of Otto Octavius would resurface, but his evil Doctor Octopus persona would always return. (In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> this Trope seemed to apply even more.)
</li></ul></li><li> There is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> comic, where after a Jedi kills a love in a fit of jealousy, she develops a dissociative disorder. One personality is a crazed killer, murdering women that remind her of the one her love was cheating on her with, while the normal personality obsessively "chases" this killer.

This was later expanded to an unnamed number of personalities — possibly thousands — ALL with a unique power. Unfortunately, when these personalities were successfully merged, the new, improved Legion decided the best thing to do was to travel back in time to kill Magneto (he missed, killing his own father and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">unintentionally spawning</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a> timeline).

In that time period, he seems to have developed a whole new personality, one who is deeply suspicious of everyone and has increasingly dangerous sociopathic tendencies; occasionally, however, brief glimpses of his old personality come through, either to cry about his situation, or to try to warn his old friend/lover about things that his new personality is planning to do or has already done. The thing that adds an extra dark twist to all of this is that it suggests that the persona you see Matt present in the game—the vague, cute, airheaded side that you see before the reveal—is an entirely fake persona made up by the new sociopathic one; the fake persona is sort of a shallow mockery of his original personality, which seems to have entirely vanished by the end of the story.</span>

Special mention goes to <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/118750">Ipseity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which gives Bucky <em>four</em> personalities: in addition to the original Bucky and the nameless HYDRA assassin, there's the German prisoner "Axel" who's the best of them at making plans and the Russian patriot "Yasha" who's the most innocent and childlike of them — and all of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTeam">fully aware of and cooperative with one another</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em>, primarily an MCU/Marvel crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> (though other fandoms are involved), has several examples, some more ambiguous than others.
<ul><li> Thor at first seems to have one between himself and his former life as James, with the James side being lighter and less formal, before the two merge as Thor adjusts to the memories.
</li><li> Bucky, meanwhile, is a clearer cut example, with at least three possible personalities: Bucky, Captain America's best friend, a slightly roguish straight up hero; the Winter Soldier, the cold, logical, utterly ruthless and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">absurdly determined</a> assassin who tends to think in terms of robotic threat assessment; and James, who's more or less a mixture of the remnants of the former after Red Room brainwashing and the latter, developing during his time in the Red Room. After Strange restores his memories at the end of <em>Child of the Storm</em>, his default is James, albeit one who comes off as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> version of Bucky, and he can and does drop into the Winter Soldier persona when he needs to dispose of an enemy with maximum ruthlessness and efficiency - though it takes a bit of effort to come out of it again.
</li><li> Harry develops two possible examples in the sequel, <em>Ghosts of the Past</em>. The first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Red Son</span>, is a cold, ruthless assassin, intentionally modelled on the Winter Soldier, which is locked away because of the horrific memories he's associated with. However, Harry and others dismiss him as being nothing more than a collection of memories, one that didn't exist for long enough to really develop a personality of his own, and as of chapter 45 of <em>Ghosts</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harry's integrated him and the memories</span>. The second, and by far the more dangerous, personality is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Dark Phoenix</span>, which combines all of Harry's inner darkness, his fear, rage, resentment, and pain, with the volatility of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Phoenix</span>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> levels of power. Not a healthy mix. However, Harry has firm control over both of them, and the main risk is the possibility that he might <em>choose</em> to let them out.

Considering the author's knowledge of DID and MPD, and the lack of distinctive traits of either, it's quite possible that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Kira</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">something else entirely</a>.
</li><li> Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></em>, but has a number of 'personalities' for each of the other three houses. Harry isn't implied to be mentally ill exactly: the personalities are his own imagination and/or part of his reasoning process, not truly separate characters. They mostly come up to add interesting comments, like when 'Hufflepuff' jokingly suggests that Harry get over his temporary fear of accidentally eating something sentient (developed after he learns that it's possible to speak to snakes) by suggesting he eat the fellow students instead. After all, their sentience isn't in question.
<ul><li> Harry also worries that he has a 'dark' side that he must control. He often thinks of his Dark side as something more akin to an alternate personality that he can choose to allow to 'take control' but must be afraid of.
</li></ul></li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> fics involve Harry suffering from non-canonical more extreme Dursley abuse and developing split personalities as a result, sometimes with later personalities emerging due to the various traumatic events at Hogwarts. In one story, it was <em>Voldemort</em> who had the split personality, and after a psychiatrist/Death Eater got his psycho personality to go into "hibernation", he became Harry's mentor and supported him in his dreams of becoming an Auror, while in a similar story the Voldemort persona was the result of an experiment in <em>creating</em> split personalities that was backed by Dumbledore.

The original Pinkie thinks of the other two - the more playful Surprise (born from the conflict between boring monotony and the sudden, overwhelming happiness when she saw the Sonic Rainboom and the events that followed) and the more serious Pinkamena (born to shield Pinkie and Surprise from the pain and suffering they were being put through by an unscrupulous psychiatrist) - as her closest friends, and it helps that due to Pinkie's brain being wired differently, Surprise and Pinkamena are more balanced than most split personalities (Pinkamena suspects the reason is that they have access to a full range of emotions rather than just one or two each). While her Ponyville friends are more than a little surprised when they initially find out, they quickly come to accept the situation, since the doctors and Pinkie's own family have long since accepted that the two exist and aren't dangerous to her or anypony else.

The two personalities are almost completely unaware of each other, at least until the plot comes knocking. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the book's climax, the two personalities integrate into Susannah Dean, who possesses the good sense of the former, and the tenacity and will of the latter</span>.

</li></ul><ul><li> Altogether Andrews, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series, has <em>eight</em> personalities, none of which answer to Andrews. There's also Agnes Nitt and her alter ego <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Perdita X.

<ul><li> This is apparently not that uncommon on the Discworld. Perdita is explained as having come about specifically because Agnes took a part of herself — her desire to not be a nice girl with a good personality — and gave it a name. Her senior witches muse to themselves that giving something a name gives it life, too. Rincewind's conscience and Sam Vimes's inner rage are also sometimes depicted as semi-sentient, especially in <em>Night Watch</em>, where Vimes refers to it as "The Beast". In <em>Thud!</em>, we find Vimes also has an "inner watchman", who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">kicking a powerful vengeance spirit out of Vimes' mind.</a></span>
</li><li> Mightily Oates also suffers from this, dividing into a skeptic part and a devout part. At one point, he considered having himself exorcized. And, like Agnes/Perdita, he is resistant to vampiric mind control, because they can control only one mind per brain.

This causes the sides to battle for dominance, the consequences of which vary in severity depending on how different the Roman and Greek aspects are. Gods like Aphrodite/Venus or Nemesis walk off scot-free, since the ideas of love and revenge are the same in Greece and Rome. Hercules/Heracles gets headaches, but otherwise it isn't too bad. Athena/Minerva is reduced to a scatter-brained wreck and Dionysus/Bacchus can't remember Percy and gets a blinding headache when Percy calls him Dionysus instead of Bacchus. The issue is apparently grave enough for them to be rendered incapable of dealing with other problems until the issue is resolved.

</li><li> This is the premise for the Russian comedy series <em>Zaitsev+1</em>. The protagonist, Sasha Zaitsev (sometimes Latinized as Zaicev) is a typical college nerd who is in love with Nastya, the prettiest girl in his class, although she doesn't know it and stays with her cheating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> boyfriend. Whenever Zaitsev gets hit in the head, is blinded by a bright light, or is deafened by a loud noise, he turns into Fyodor, his wild, rude, and cynical alter ego who likes big women. While Fyodor is actually played by a different actor, only the audience perceives him as a different person. Everyone else just notices that Zaitsev is suddenly acting very differently. Fyodor likes to sleep around, especially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">another girl named Nastya</a>, which becomes a problem for Zaitsev, who can't really explain his problem to others without sounding insane.

In the episode "Power Failure", Sgt. Wojohowicz arrests shy Charlie Keller for punching a bookie; Charlie insists Lenny did it, and Lenny, a loudmouth roughneck, later shows up and cheerfully admits it. When their doctor bails them out, a third, unknown person appears; he's an erudite, high-class sort who's been trying to come to the front and speak to the doctor for a long time.
</li><li> Jim and Jerry Reynolds are not faking on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Becker">Becker</a></em> either in "Papa Does Preach". They're quite real and there's a clever twist in that the rude, assertive Jerry is the one who's trying to cooperate with Becker on the need to take cholesterol medication. Being multiple was portrayed as persons in a family with very different temperaments trying to get along and take care of the body.
</li><li> Part of the reason so many cop shows have the supposed multiple turn out to be faking has to do with the Hillside Strangler case (see Real Life examples).

Aameul favors deception, while Hethradiah favors destruction. Strangely, this war within himself often turns out in Demogorgonï¿½s favor. For example, one legend tells how Hethradiah formed an alliance with a powerful lich queen, which left her vulnerable to assassins sent by Aameul.

However, a dark curse transforms him into a brutal killer called Malken whose victims are often the people Hiregaard himself cares about.

</li><li> A Ghostrider Module is an implant that can run an Infomorph, they can't take control of the body unless it has a Puppet Sock implant but they can remotely control drones.

However, since dissociative identity disorder tends to be more subtle, the game recommends representing it by purchasing the differing powers/stat changes with the limitation that they can only be used when one personality is in charge (this will tend to be a lot cheaper).

His dominant, active personality is a lunatic, buzz-ax-swinging berserker who spends most of his time spewing jumbled nonsense (i.e. trying to talk to Maya resulted in him screaming "I'M THE CONDUCTOR OF <strong>THE POOP TRAIN!</strong>" at the top of his lungs).

Hundreds of minds all locked within his own quite understandably made him snap, <em>hard.</em> The calamity ended only when his master Kylorin solved the problem by locking Perpentach's mind away and imprisoning Perpentach within a derelict building in a remote swamp...

The good side of Navlaan sealed himself behind a magical barrier after the evil side went on a murder spree, and begs the player not to let him out. If you do let Navlaan out, you'll be attacked by dark phantoms of his evil side all around Drangleic.

Saku, the girl side, is the more violent side and Bo, the actual person, is a shy boy who developed Saku to help him stand up for himself. It's essentially like sticking Blackrose and Elk into one body.

The politically correct term for these individuals is "Congenital Parallel Processor", or "CPP" for short.

However, they both seem to share incredible knowledge of electronics and machinery, and Splitzy's irrationality sometimes comes in handy when Dr. Splitz is hesitant.

<ul><li> In the earlier seasons, Mr Garrison's hand puppet Mr Hat was his other personality and imaginary friend that helped him to deal with sexual abuse and transexual thoughts. Said in "World Wide Recorder Concert":
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr Mackey:</strong> Mr Garrison, are you alright? <br/><strong>Mr Hat:</strong> Mr. Garrison isn't here right now... <br/><strong>Mr Mackey:</strong> Mkay, Mr Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you've switched personalities to Mr Hat. <br/><strong>Mr Hat:</strong> Ooh, good one Sherlock, you figured out all that by yourself?

The character is already two personas in one, but subverts the trope as the second personality can only come out when Stanley puts on the mask and changes. However, in this episode, the mask itself is split down the middle, and Stanley puts on one half. The results were... interesting, with half of his body changed into The Mask and the other half left alone. Both characters were sharing one body at the same time. This leads to some very interesting circumstances as Stanley has to try to hide this while half his body is changed. The other half of the mask? It gets worn by Stanley's old high school bully, who ends up with a psychotic murderous half that even manages to freak out the normal side.

Blitzwing's weaponry and vehicle modes seem to be tied into his personality. The calm face uses some sort of ice missile and a jet form, while the angry face uses a flamethrower and tank form and the crazy face seems to be able to use both - but is not as skilled with either. Prowl actually caught on to this during a battle, and used Bumblebee to annoy Blitzwing so much that he switched from calm/jet to angry/tank — and promptly fell out of the sky. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> gives the personalities the names of Icy, Hothead, and Random respectively. Blitzwing's personalities technically aren't different people; they're just immediate shifts between certain states. As seen in the falling tank incident, he'll often swap depending on his mood/the situation — you'll never see Icy get angry or Hothead act happy. Though there is the infrequent time that the three states interact with each other as if they were separate people. They once even debated over a vehicle mode choice:
<div class="indent"><strong>Icy:</strong> I will choose this fighter jet. <br/><strong>Hothead:</strong> No! The assault tank! <br/><strong>Icy:</strong> Jet. <br/><strong>Hothead:</strong> Tank! <br/><strong>Icy:</strong> Ze Jet. <br/><strong>Hothead:</strong> Tank! <br/><strong>Random:</strong> Ooh-ooh!

Daffy is Porky's prize in a radio contest. He claims to be schizophrenic—loving and placid when he's treated nice, but mean and monstrous if he's treated wrong. Daffy is actually yanking Porky's chain with the latter id, to which Porky eventually wises up.

When he was growing up he was actually somewhat overweight, as well as being crippingly shy and having a speech impediment. He was consequently bullied throughout elementary and middle school. The trauma eventually led to him creating an alternate "superhero" persona, which did a truly massive amount of exercise and took up sports as a coping mechanism. These changes would eventually lead him to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegeFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegeFootball">College Football</a> at Georgia, where his Olympic level speed and immense size and strength more or less allowed him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">run through anyone on the field</a>, which naturally produced some of the most <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRVE1TQvGzA">spectacular plays<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the history of the game.
