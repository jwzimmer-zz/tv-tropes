</p><p>This special feeling is usually preceded by a glance at the clock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">noting that it is 9:54</a>, and saying, "Wow, they sure have a lot of loose ends to wrap up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">in the next six minutes</a>. I wonder how they pull it off?" The answer: they don't.
</p><p>Some shows, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, actually used the principle of Left Hanging order to build an aura of mystique and uncertainty around the show. When shows that are more grounded in reality, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, wander into this territory, the results are rarely pretty.
</p><p>Occasionally the loose ends are picked up on <em>much</em> later, either as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> or as an "untold story" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>.

</p><p>It should be noted that a few of these examples are merely early plot lines that are abandoned once the main plot is kicked off. Why bother tying up loose ends on one matter when they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> to deal with?

<ul><li> Chapter 44 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> offers a flashback of Annie and Mikasa about to square off in a training fight, causing all the others to flock around them in excitement over who the winner will be. We're never told however, as that's where the flashback ends. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> later confirmed they had been so equally matched the instructor had to interfere and call it a draw.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> wraps up everything which concerns episodes 2 to 16, but the very first episode is a mash up of future events in the show, where there's a particular short scene where a blond girl slices Issac's ear off with a spear. The girl's name, Adele, is not even mentioned through the show as she would later appear in a future arc from the source material right after where the anime ends. The loose ends are lampshaded in the OVAs, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Carol asks Gustav why the story doesn't have a proper ending</a>. Gustav's answer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapWheel">is that life always throws in another plot thread for everyone it ties up, meaning that there's going to be loose threads no matter where you stop, and now's just a good place as any to end things</a>. Carol, on the other hand, thinks it's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>.
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> covers the Golden Age arc... and then it ends during the Eclipse. Since the series begins with a scene set <em>after</em> the Golden Age arc, it means <em>the series never got out of the flashback</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>. Everything is left hanging. Everything.

No matter what, a lot is left hanging.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: The manga was cancelled midway through its Final Arc as a result of Kubo's increasingly worsening health since 2010 that leaves him bedridden with increasing frequency; he only kept going for as long as he did as a result of an inspiring letter that he received after the death of a terminally ill child who had enjoyed reading Kubo's manga while bedridden. Many established plot threads were abandoned in order to wrap up the final battle in time for the manga's fifteenth anniversary. These include, but are not limited to, the Ishida family's true history, the reveal of several Bankai (including Ichigo's new one), the fate of Captain Komamura <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after losing his human form, the exact nature of Yachiru's existence as Kenpachi's Zanpakuto spirit (as well as the rules of Zaraki's Bankai), and whether or not Nel was able to rescue Grimmjow, Yoruichi and Urahara from Askin Nakk Le Vaar's poison prison</span>. The subsequent light novels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BleachWeDoKnotAlwaysLoveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BleachWeDoKnotAlwaysLoveYou">Bleach: We Do Knot Always Love You</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BleachCannotFearYourOwnWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BleachCannotFearYourOwnWorld">Bleach: Can't Fear Your Own World</a></em> resolve many of these.
</li><li> Mari's fate in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop">Blue Drop</a></em> anime after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her loved one Hagino dies</span> is never addressed, not even in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">huge time skip</a> at the end of the series. This is especially egregious, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hagino</span> sacrificed herself to save Mari's life, so it would at least have been nice to know how Mari dealt with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> actually resolved its main premise, but several subplot threads were apparently lost in the rush or deemed less important somewhere between seasons as the staff had to alter their original plans due to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">unexpected time slot change</a>. They include the true nature of Suzaku's superhuman abilities, C.C.'s real name and, perhaps most frustratingly for several viewers, any sort of official explanation for the Geass. In regards to the last one however, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled">Code Geass: Akito the Exiled</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a> <em>Re;surrection</em> give some hints to it, while simultaneously raising even <em>more</em> questions in the process. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Such as just what in the hell that skull was that gave Shin his Geass.</span>
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> had a mostly-satisfying ending, but never addressed the fact that Izaya was still in possession of Celty's severed head. This is mostly due to the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">Light Novel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">series the show was based on is still running in Japan</a>, leaving the writers without a proper ending to adapt. With a second season currently airing, however, it's possible that this will eventually be resolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> ties up nearly every significant plot thread except for one: Lucy's promise to reunite with Aquarius after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> was over, something that remained unresolved by the one-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a>. Fortunately, this is addressed by the manga's official sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail100YearsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail100YearsQuest">Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest</a></em>, which picks the subplot back up as a major driving force for Lucy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> resolves its main plot, but leaves hanging a number of plot threads, most importantly the precise origin of The Whispered (only resolved in the novels) and the Black Technology that seems to be encoded in their genetic structure. One might presume the new season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, "The Second Raid", would answer some of the unresolved issues. It doesn't, and the source material is still going; while there's no absolute guarantee it'll be dealt with, resolving these issues would require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">making something up just to end the anime</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> - both the anime and the manga, but for different reasons. In the anime, material was added for the second series to ensure enough was left for a third series, but there's no guarantee there ever will be one to finish the job. The manga has the "life goes on"-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a> that is so typical for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> series, so it was almost inevitable that not everything got wrapped up.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Daisuke</a> has been permitted to leave Judoh and go off on adventures, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Kyoko</a> tells him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">I Will Wait for You</a> (but only for three years), and he promises to come back. Off he goes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset">Riding into the Sunset</a> and...that's it. Where did he go? What did he do? What became of Kyoko? And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Clair</a>? And the others? The world will never know. It appears to have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>, but that sequel never materialized.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em>: Everything was left hanging. The play that they built up for 6 or 7 episodes never happened, there was no culture fest, and the only way to actually understand what happened between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tonami and Sakura</span> in the final episode was to read the manga.
</li><li> A variety occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoiKoi7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoiKoi7">Koi Koi 7</a></em>, where everything is set up for the final battle with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>—only to have everybody inexplicably relax on a beach in the last episode. An attempt is made to explain what happened in a short DVD-only episode, but it's still one heck of a sudden turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first anime fell into this <em>hard</em>, mainly because it was supposed to go for two seasons, but the general lack of quality and pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>-ness got it killed after one season, forcing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> and dropping a bunch of newly introduced plot threads. Not that two seasons would have come close to covering everything in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">the manga</a>, but starting a bunch of B-plots and then ending the series <em>two episodes later</em> is pretty bad.
</li><li> The manga hits the same issue (though much later on and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun">for different reasons</a>), trying to at least resolve as much as it can in the very last chapter and only succeeding partially. If you want to know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who the Gravekeeper is, what happened to Arika</span> or any number of other things like that, you won't get to know. And more importantly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRomanticResolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRomanticResolution">who Negi ended with</a>. In fact, we only got that the most likely candidates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">DIDN'T win</a>, which is even worse than not getting anything at all.

Never brought up again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ida's sister</span> <em>being kidnapped by the freaking magical FBI?</em> Guess what? Never brought up again! The final episode then delivered the biggest and most confusing plot twist of the whole show, and then promptly ended without explaining anything at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> does this <em>twice</em> at least in America- first, the series ends with only a bare acknowledgment of how the war ended, then they made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> which takes place after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, doesn't explain the war's end either, and ends on its own cliffhanger (it was meant to be the first part of a movie trilogy which was never finished). The first hanger was only resolved through information which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There In The Japan-Only Sega Games</a>. The last episode of the series even has the audacity to introduce <em>new</em> subplots just to intentionally leave them hanging.
</li><li> While the manga it is based off is still running and does reveal everything that happens past this point, the OVA series for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamThunderbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamThunderbolt">Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt</a></em> ends with the revelation of who the leader of the South Seas Alliance-based religion is and that he has possession of the once-thought destroyed Psycho Zaku, we never find out how the Federation and the Zeon Remnants handle them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em> anime cuts off the second half of the story, leaving the entirety of the dragons — where they come from, why they're here, everything — hanging, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> that's seemingly studying them, and the 'villains' that needlessly kill people with them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">talk of making a better world</a> vanish off the face of the earth — mind you, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">so badly characterized</a> nobody cares much anyhow. And wraps it all up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Shoot the Shaggy Dog</a> ending.
</li><li> The original TV ending for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> didn't resolve much, and in fact the English edition has a hilarious Easter Egg where Spike Spencer, the English voice actor for Shinji, complained (in-character) about the sheer number of dangling plot threads that were never addressed. Many of these ended up being answered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> finale, <em>End of Evangelion</em>.
</li><li> Parodied / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> (like a bazillion other tropes) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden">Ninin Ga Shinobuden</a></em>. Onsokumaru and another character have an ominous conversation about Shinobu's hidden destiny. In the last episode the characters realize they forgot all about this plot thread and hastily construct a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> story to cover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> pulls this to a seemingly sadistic degree. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In literally the last minute, Stocking inexplicably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">reveals she's actually a demon</a>, chops Panty into pieces, and leaves Brief on a quest to gather them back up.</span> The end. Aside from a tease in the episode itself, there hasn't been a whisper of a new season in the years since to follow any of this up — which was the point, as it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on other shows with similar conclusions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Geekboy Homecoming</em> ended up subverting this by showing the tail end of that plot thread and how Brief got Panty back, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">that just opened a whole</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">new</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">can of worms</a> by throwing in cryptic references to whatever's going on with Stocking and Garterbelt as well as the loose plot threads from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco">a completely unrelated series</a> in <em>its</em> last few pages. No matter the studio, the folks behind <em>P&amp;S</em> really like trolling their audience.</span>
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Piano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Piano">Piano</a></em> is about Miu composing a piece for her piano recital. At the big moment, the story simply cuts off when Miu starts playing, without stating how the recital went or what happens between Miu and her love interest afterward. Sure, the main point is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Miu's decision about her music and her life</a>, but it would have been nice to get some more closure.
</li><li> A particularly infamous example of this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>; the anime version, already criticized for being stuffed to the brim with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> that had absolutely no bearing on the original manga plot, concluded a full <em>three years</em> before the original manga did, cutting out roughly a full third of the overall plot. For those without easy access to the manga (which, as a note, did not finish officially releasing in English-speaking countries until 2006, <em>ten years</em> after the conclusion of the manga in the original Japanese), this was kind of a huge kick in the pants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> managed to end without Eibon, the enigmatic being behind Noah and the Book of Eibon having made an appearance outside of a flashback. Hell, the entirety of Noah, who has the Book of Eibon and Brew and 5 more copies of himself. Only Noah-Greed was given a major role as a villain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral">Spiral</a></em> suffers this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> form. It's a mystery series, and its main mysteries are "What are the Blade Children?" and "What happened to Kiyotaka, Ayumu's older brother?" The anime never answers either of these questions, as the manga hadn't yet by the time it finished production. An offhand comment by Kanone might or might not imply that Kiyotaka is dead in the anime continuity, and another compares the Blade Children to cuckoos, but that's it. The manga did ultimately end up clarifying all this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a>, and the manga seems to in turn have overtaken the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a> on which it was based. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">death of the original author</a> didn't help matters. Bottom line is that the ending of <em>Trinity Blood</em> anime failed to wrap up <em>any</em> long-running plot threads whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VariableGeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VariableGeo">Variable Geo</a></em> ends abruptly on a cliff-hanger, just as the final bout between Yuka and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Satomi</span> begins. Who wins, or whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daisuke</span> receives the medical treatment he needs is left uncertain.
</li><li> Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> of the anime, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus">Venus Versus Virus</a></em> didn't end well. Did Sumire and Lucia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">die?</span> The manga has a <em>completely</em> different ending arc, so this is never revealed. Though, it is greatly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMG">suggested</a> that they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">did survive, and that all Lucia did was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownhug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownhug">hug</a> Sumire.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows">The World God Only Knows</a></em> has the entire plot suddenly resolved with the abrupt revelation that a main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Elsie)</span> is actually a powerful monster and the enemy's ultimate weapon and her using her powers to produce some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> that makes the good guys win somehow.

<ul><li> Some inquired on Bunn's social media if he thought Pak would follow up on the Creed/Monet relationship, but Bunn gave no response. Pak was asked in an X-Position panel if he would continue Bunn's work on Sabretooth -since his moral struggle &amp; budding ship with Monet couldn't be wrapped up by Uncanny's end. Pak said he had plans to follow up on the former, but no answer on the latter.

There was also some mystery about the sudden disappearance of Old Lace. When the team later reappeared in other books, Chase's near death was handwaved, and Old Lace's disappearance was explained in a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">raised more questions</a>, but Gert's sudden reappearance was never explained, and Chase's uncle was never heard from again.

The other frequent way new writers will wrap up an arc is to quickly kill off the key characters in their first issue and then go tell the stories <em>they</em> want to tell.

The hanging plot thread regarding Charles Logan was ultimately subverted it the long run, as he turns out to have survived his wound and went on to serve as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the final season.

When the loop breaks, they find out that their collision partner is a ship — captained by Kelsey Grammer — that is a full century out of date, the USS <em>Bozeman</em>.

Examples include Boxey in Season 1, who was left on the cutting room floor after two episodes, and "Shelly Godfrey", a Number Six hiding within the civilian fleet who is never seen again after her sole appearance. (Notably, Helo's storyline was <em>intended</em> to be abandoned after the pilot miniseries, but was maintained due to popular demand.) Apparently, Shelly Godfrey will eventually be explained, in "The Plan". However, the Opera House itself (not the visions), the original temple on the Algae Planet, and the exact nature of the Lords of Kobol seem destined to remain in the file marked Left Hanging. Not to mention "God". Many fans thought that Shelly Godfrey was just Head Six who had materialized herself to help Baltar, but The Plan shows that she was a real Six trying to discredit him. Cavil and another, cooler Six intimate that she made it too easy to discover her fake evidence because of Baltar's "dreamy hair".

A third movie was announced, but seems to be stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>.
<ul><li> Also left in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> was an MMORPG, and concepts for another series... Interestingly however, <em>Stargate: The Ark of Truth</em> seemed to be quite deliberate in avoiding stating "Yes, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asgard are dead and gone we're not going to retcon that</span>." Events from the final SG1 episode remain, for instance the presence of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asgard computer core</span>, but there is no reference to the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fate of the Asgard</span>. Oddly though, they are stated as an intended playable race in the MMORPG, which takes place some time after the upcoming movies — supposedly a significant amount of time, despite, again, being allegedly canonical.
</li><li> Stargate is a prime example of this trope in general. Especially in the first seasons there were a lot of plotlines opened that were just left hanging. For example, Daniel's grandfather as ambassador with an alien super race is never again heard from. Or the time they found a device with the recorded knowledge of all the ancient races on a planet where the gate plunges into the ocean is never visited again as soon as the SGC has ships. You should think something like this would be of value enough to fly there, especially since the planet was very close to Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> Keeping with the Stargate tradition is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>, At the end of the final episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eli has decided to stay awake onboard the Destiny while everyone else goes into stasis, in hopes of fixing the broken stasis pod and joining them so the Destiny can begin its <em>really</em> long voyage to another galaxy, one where they are not constantly pursued by evil aliens and robot drones. It ends with Eli staring contemplatively into space and no follow-up seasons exist to resolve matters.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em> ends similarly, with a finale that ends on a cliffhanger, with a few but not all plot threads updated if not resolved. There was also talk of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a> movie for <em>that</em> one, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">never got beyond the talk phase</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> ends with a sci-fi cliffhanger involving Rimmer kicking Death in the groin with the rest of his cast members are in a mirror universe, while the ship was being eaten slowly by a genetically engineered virus.
<ul><li> The new 3-parter on Dave 10 years later does nothing to resolve this, as it's set, well, 10 years later. In fact, just to make things more frustrating (intentionally), the 3-parter includes a meta-reference to the existence of a "Series 9" which included resolution of this plot (there wasn't one, the show ended at series 8 and then the next episodes were the 3-parter). Then after the 3-parter the show started "Series X". In the finale of series X they even specifically mentioned the cliff-hanger at the end of series 8 but changed the topic before they could give the audience any details about it what happened with it.
</li><li> Lampshaded/subverted with the end of Season 2. Season 2 ended with Dave pregnant with twins fathered by a female version of himself from a mirror universe. Season 3 opened with a <em>Star Wars</em> Crawl that explained it all away, but was too fast to read.
</li></ul></li><li> The ending of the TV miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLostRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLostRoom">The Lost Room</a></em> wrapped up only the main story line (Joe searching for his daughter) and left <em>every other plot thread</em> unanswered. This is because it was meant to be the pilot for an ongoing series, where those story lines would presumably be continued, but its low ratings meant that the series never happened.
</li><li> The Fox sci-fi series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em> ended its one season run with an awful lot of loose ends left unwrapped. The show ended with one character presumed dead, two more falling in an escape pod into enemy territory, one reunited with his prisoner-of-war lover, and everyone else generally in limbo.
</li><li> <em>90210</em> started off as a series that involved both the old gang (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">the ones from the 90s</a>) and a new fresh almost entirely unrelated (except for the half-sister of the franchise protagonist). For instance, it was revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dylan and Kelly had a son but then broke up, Brenda was sterile but ended up adopting, Kelly's mother relapsed in alcoholism and got cancer for which she'd die in the second season</span>, but as the show changed executives, it was decided that it wouldn't rely on the old gang any longer (except for Kelly, who's now been downgraded to recurring supporting character), leaving the whole thing about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what happened to Donna and David, their divorce, their kid, David's flowers and message</span> in the air.
</li><li> The final (British) series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em> ended with a battered, bloodied future version of Matt appearing him, warning him that there's still something he needs to fix, and that he needs to 'go back'. With the <em>New World</em> series mostly unrelated to the old characters, the movie languishing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> and the sixth series even worse, it is doubtful this huge plot thread will ever be picked up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus">Titus</a></em> was canceled before they could write a proper episode to conclude the series. While the last episode was good and funny, it ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Titus being put in a mental hospital for a few months as a stipulation for everyone to avoid jail time.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode deals with Dwight finding a joint in the parking lot and becoming more paranoid than ever as he tries to find the culprit. By the end this morphs into Dwight covering for Michael, who had accidentally inhaled some pot smoke the night before, leaving the question of how the joint itself got there unanswered. It's revealed in a deleted scene that it's two employees from Vance Refrigeration.
</li><li> Dwight never finds the man who flashed Phyllis.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a> Kabuto</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Who is Dark Tendou?

Then it ends forever.
</li><li> Name a high-concept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom">Sitcom</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em>, and many others were summarily canceled when the time came, even after a successful run and regardless of whether or not the show featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc">An Arc</a>, simply because that's how business was done at the time. A lot of them eventually got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a> movies once they'd had enough time in syndication to get interest back up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>:
<ul><li> Perhaps David Lynch thought that by leaving <em>every single subplot</em> sadistically hanging on multiple cliffs that the fans would scream and cry for another season in which to see them all resolved. If such was the case, then the tactic didn't work as the show was canceled with little fanfare and with much grumping by the small devoted fanbase the show had. And apart from the subplots, the main plot wasn't really resolved with the "How's Annie!" ending either.
</li><li> Interestingly, the show was originally planning on doing this on purpose with the murder of Laura Palmer; part of the reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> (and consequent cancellation) of season 2 is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">network forced them to reveal the murderer</a>.
</li><li> The movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwinPeaksFireWalkWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwinPeaksFireWalkWithMe">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</a></em>, ended up a prequel, which meant it did almost nothing to resolve any of these ambiguities. However, in the usual Twin Peaks fashion, there are a few chronological irregularities that tie into the events of the series' finale (though in a very ambiguous and indirect manner).
</li><li> A sequel series, released almost 25 years after the fact, does tie up some unresolved plot and character points, though leaves others unanswered and adds quite a few new ones as well.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cracker">Cracker</a></em> episode "One Day A Lemming Will Fly", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fitz actually spends the entire episode pursuing the wrong man for the murder of a child. The episode's entire resolution hinges on the fact that the child's killer will never be known - at least, until he strikes again...</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY">Kyle XY</a></em> left many plots dangling (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> cleared up a few of them). In fact, the finale actually <em>introduced</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">a new plotline</a> in the last few seconds of the episode!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> had, initially, one of the most evil Left Hanging endings ever. Knowing they were going to be canceled, the writers extricated the crew from the worst of the crap they were buried in, and set them on a planet to recuperate. This left some of the major arcs unfinished, but hey, we can deal with that, right? So there they are, recuperating. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> John proposes to Aeryn. It's a really touching moment. The crew are watching, all happy. Then, out of nowhere, the newly affianced couple get <em>blown up by a random fighter craft</em>.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued">To Be Continued</a>. On a show that's canceled. Luckily, there was enough fan pressure that a TV miniseries, the Peacekeeper Wars, was eventually made and tied up the remaining loose ends.
</li><li> Done very intentionally in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> episode "Doubt", which literally cuts off <em>right before the verdict</em> (as in, the last line of the episode is, "We find the defendant —" <em>Cut to black</em>), so not only does the audience not find out what really happened, they don't even know the outcome of the trial. Viewers who saw the episode live were invited to take a survey on whether, in their opinion, 1. The man was guilty, 2. He was innocent or 3. There "wasn't enough" evidence to make a judgment on the facts displayed. (Option 2 recieved 60% of the vote, with the other two getting 20% each.)
<ul><li> The intial murder case in "Harm" ends with the suspect fleeing the country to a non-extraditable location, so they can't even confirm that he did it. What's more, because of how much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">Halfway Plot Switch</a> (involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a> who was implicated in a related murder) is already beginning to take over the episode when this is revealed, many viewers didn't even remember <em>that</em> much, leading to a perception that the murder case had just dropped away with no explanation.
</li><li> The season eleven episode "Savior" did this. A young prostitute goes into premature labor and her baby is put on life support. The mother then runs away, giving power of attorney to Olivia, effectively giving Olivia the choice of whether the baby lives or dies. The episode ends with the baby needing immediate brain surgery and the doctors hammering Olivia for a decision that she never gives. This turns into a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>, as neither the baby nor the mother are ever seen or heard from again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosingCredits">"Executive Producer Dick Wolf"</a> are often claimed to be the most frustrating words in the English language, due to the many episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, and the spin offs, that end without enough resolution or sometimes any resolution at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>: In the rush to wrap up the Red John arc (because viewers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">getting tired of it</a>), the series ultimately failed to resolve a couple of loose ends from earlier in the arc.
<ul><li> The most notable example is the connection between Red John and the Visualize cult. After teasing it for several seasons, a Season 5 episode confirmed that a link existed, but that's the extent of what's revealed; the man who turns out to be Red John has no established connection with the cult, and in fact that link is never mentioned again. (The fact that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped A Bridge on</a> the cult leader doesn't help.)
</li><li> In the Season 5 finale, Red John is able to do a few things that should be impossible; he accesses a memory of Jane's that Jane had never shared, and he demonstrates that he knew who would be on Jane's final list of Red John suspects months before Jane actually created said list. How all of this was accomplished is never established, and the entire thing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> by having Jane decline an explanation in favor of taking his revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to being canceled by the second season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em> left a lot of stuff hanging, in spite of its sweet finale. Alfredo and Oscar were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> by the end of the first season, and no one will ever find out where is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Charles Charles</span> or what the deal with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ned's father</span> was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> inverts this problem—the carefully planned five-season format of the original show wrapped up <em>the entire premise of the universe</em> at the end of the series, dooming future sequels to serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis">Sequelitis</a> from the very beginning, as they seem like nothing but barely related afterthoughts to a story that has already been told. A more straight example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> sequel <em>Crusade</em>, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> only half a season in, leaving the Drakh plague story arc unresolved.
<ul><li> According to JMS's DVD commentary, the plague plot was to have been wrapped up in the second season. As with the original, the real plot was supposed to lead out of things that seemed like minor side details in the episodes that actually aired. The endgame for the Drakh war was handled in novels set more than a decade after the events of the full run of Crusade would have been over.
</li></ul></li><li> The '90s AMC series <em>Remember WENN</em> ended with an unresolved cliffhanger after the network's new management abruptly canceled the show.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> never received a fitting conclusion. This series has also drifted in and out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> <em>several</em> times, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisCarter">Chris Carter</a> knows he's playing with fire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>: Hey, what ever did happen to that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Russian guy</a> in the woods?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood">Deadwood</a></em> was canceled after three seasons, and had been intended to run longer. As the series was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">the real history of Deadwood</a> in a macro sense, there was enough material and history left for at least a few more seasons. Due to the abrupt cancellation, several plotlines had to be hastily tied up, to no one's satisfaction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009">Flash Forward</a></em> left just about all plotlines open due to series cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar">Foyle's War</a></em> was canceled and restarted multiple times, with each cancellation resulting in an attempt to tie up the series hastily, and then put everyone together again when the series resumed. Furthermore, the first cancellation resulted in the season then in production to skip several months of time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> per episode. Prior to that season, each episode had a gap of days or weeks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ALF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ALF">ALF</a></em> ends with the eponymous alien surrounded by government agents facing certain vivisection. What happens to him after would later be covered in a TV movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bugs">Bugs</a></em> ended with Alex's husband murdered by persons unknown at her wedding and Beckett and Ros being kidnapped by a mysterious man they seemed to recognize. The cancellation of the series means we'll never know who killed the poor man, or who kidnapped our two heroes.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Class" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Class">Class</a></em> ended on a triple cliffhanger : Miss Quill was pregnant with a kid that could kill her, April was trapped in the body of an alien, and the Board of Governors' backers were revealed. BBC has announced that there won't be a second season, so no resolutions to those plotlines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em> was canceled at the end of the fourth season, which ended on a big cliffhanger and a To Be Continued. It's somewhat dealt with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope">Raising Hope</a></em> where we find out that a "A local man who made list of good things to do finally finished it." Both shows are by the same creator, Greg Garcia.
</li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.platypuscomix.net/hollywood/shrunktv.html">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoneyIShrunkTheKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoneyIShrunkTheKids">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a></em> ended its first season revealing that the leader of the Men in Black (no, not <em>those</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a>) was an evil alien who had plans for the Szalinskis. It ended up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">tossed by the wayside</a> for the rest of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> has a few plot-points unresolved or not referred to, and they revolve around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shipping</a> that is not the main focus for the show, and only comes up in a handful of episodes per season. There are differing ideas on what it meant, mostly around which side of the Creddie (Carly + Freddie) or Seddie (Sam + Freddie) shipping divide people stand on.
<ul><li> The first, is the end of "iThink They Kissed" where Carly asks Sam and Freddie (who shared a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss">First Kiss</a>, then hid it from Carly), how long it was, and if they enjoyed it. The episode ended before they answered the question.
</li><li> The second, is at the end of "iSpeed Date", Sam walks in on Freddie and Carly sharing a slow romantic dance in each other's arms. She walks out with saying a word. Again, it's not been brought up again, so speculation abounds on her motives and feelings for Freddie (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HoYay/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HoYay/ICarly">Carly</a>). Again, what people think is based around the shipping divide.
</li><li> Finally, "iSaved Your Life", where Freddie saves Carly's life, they enter a relationship. Carly tries to say she loves Freddie, but Freddie still breaks up with her because Sam put it into his head that Carly just loved that he was heroic and she's just hero worshiping. Freddie says to Carly that if she wants to be his boyfriend in the future, he'd love to.

</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em> had Cordell Walker rescue a girl who was trapped in a Christian cult camp, but with the last minutes of the episode devoted to Walker's rescue of Alex Cahill from the cult camp, it's unknown what has happened to the girl he was supposed to rescue. An even worse example is the movie "Trial by Fire" which ends with Alex being shot in the courthouse and lying near death. Supposedly, the producers were expecting CBS to offer them the opportunity to make further TV movies but low ratings (supposedly due to a football game preceding the movie running an hour longer than anticipated) and CBS shortly thereafter scrapping their Sunday night TV movie has made further TV movies unlikely. INSP network even doctored the movie to edit out the final scene with the shooting because there is no resolution and removing Alex's shooting leaves the story in a position to end without a hitch.
</li><li> Probably due to extra seasons being planned but ultimately being cancelled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">BBC</a>, season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHouseOfEliott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHouseOfEliott">The House of Eliott</a></em> ended with an unresolved argument between Evie and Beatrice over the direction of the eponymous fashion house.

Jasper and Maggie wonder what the noise was, and Henry suggests the area is "more than just dust and bones".

</li><li> So much for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCape">The Cape</a></em>. Didn't help they reduced the seasons episodes from 13 to 10, and didn't even show the last episode on TV (you had to go to the website to watch it). So die hard fans will never know if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> will ever go to jail, Vince will ever clear his name, or his family will know that he is alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThisIsWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThisIsWonderland">This Is Wonderland</a></em>, a brilliant Canadian legal dramedy, ran for three seasons, and ended on <em>three concurrent cliffhangers</em>.
</li><li> In the fourth series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> Guinevere and (a fake) Lancelot are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> with magic into kissing each other on the night before Gwen's wedding to Arthur, resulting in Gwen's exile and Lancelot's suicide. Although Guinevere is eventually welcomed back to Camelot by the end of the season and becomes its Queen through her marriage to Arthur, no one (including herself) ever finds out that she wasn't acting of her own volition when she cheated on Arthur, even though it would have only taken a simple conversation with Merlin (who knew that Lancelot was being controlled by Morgana) to clear up the issue (Gwen being smart enough to realize that the bracelet Lancelot gave her was probably the cause of her abrupt change in behaviour). Yet for whatever reason, the writers thought exonerating the pair of them wasn't worth any meaningful resolution, and the fact that Guinevere <em>had</em> to have found out at some point that Lancelot killed himself isn't ever addressed in any way.
</li><li> The short-lived BBC soap opera <em>Eldorado</em> did this deliberately in the hope that viewers would demand to know what happened next and force an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">UnCancellation</a>. It didn't work.
</li><li> Recent seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> under showrunner Steven Moffat have become known for this, as the writer is known for playing the "long game" and introducing plot threads that are intentionally left unresolved for years. The series has also picked up on the occasional hanging thread dating back <em>decades</em> (such as a 2013 episode, "The Name of the Doctor" that answered questions dating back to <em>the very first episode in 1963</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a></em>: The final episode ended with Rebecca having been shot and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly dying on the operating table</span>, and no indication what would happen to the 63s who were still at large.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow">The Amanda Show</a></em> had a recurring skit called "Moody's Point" which was a parody of teen angst shows. It had a twist that Moody was switched at birth and wasn't the real Moody and the episode ended before we could be introduced to the real Moody. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> cancelled the show at that point and Dan Schneider later <a class="urllink" href="http://danwarp.blogspot.com/2008/05/faq-what-happened-with-moodys-point.html">wrote in his blog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he doesn't even know who the real Moody is since the show was cancelled before he could write the script.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, it is never revealed who sent the assassin to kill Bran Stark. In the third book, Tyrion and Jaime both deduce it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joffrey</span>, however in the TV series it is never mentioned, and since nearly everyone who would care is dead the question was dropped. The seventh season eventually ends up implying that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Littlefinger</span> sent the assassin, which creates something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a> since the timeline for this to have been planned by that particular person is not <em>impossible</em>, but pretty questionable.
</li><li> To its credit, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forever">Forever</a></em> did resolve what happened to Abigail, the identities of Abe's birth parents, and the fate of the ship Henry was sailing on during his first death. But it ended its only season with no answers about the source of the immortality curse or how Henry can break it. Along those same lines, the evil immortal Adam is immobilized but still alive, and could be a threat later on if he dies again, but we won't know how so. As to whether or not Henry ever told Jo his secret, the show ends right when he's confronted with evidence, and though the dialogue implies he will tell her, we ultimately don't know for sure. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> attempted to clear some of this up on Twitter after the cancellation (e.g. Adam would return with the help of a third immortal, and Jo would become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a>), but not much else — in fact, some tidbits raised even <em>more</em> questions.

A third and final series had been scripted but was cancelled due to the same hostility to SF and fantasy among the BBC's leadership that saw <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> gradually smothered at around the same time.

Since there will be no Season 3, we'll never know what would have happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKnightsOfProsperity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKnightsOfProsperity">The Knights Of Prosperity</a></em>, about a group of friends trying to rob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a>, was cancelled partway into its first season (with the remaining episode airing over the rest of the year), ending with them almost robbing, and almost getting caught robbing Mick Jagger, then deciding not after meeting him in person and finding he's actually a nice guy, and deciding to rob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayRomano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayRomano">Ray Romano</a> instead after meeting him and finding him to be a jerk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMick">The Mick</a></em> ends with Sabrina critically injured, with the doctor unsure of whether she's received brain damage.

The series was cancelled after that, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> did at least explain where it would have gone in an interview.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> saga surprisingly avoided this problem.

According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> however, it was originally supposed to be played straight, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> being the last game chronologically in-universe; so whether or not Metal Gear counts as an example depends on whether one wants to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has references to "Techno-Soldiers" replacing human agents of Shinra early in the game, but is never elaborated on and is forgotten once Sephiroth is introduced into the game.

This storyline is quickly folded into the main plot, but the question of whether Timber becomes free in the end is never addressed. However, since the Timber mission was a low-paying and therefore low-importance goal, when the sorceress showed up and became a threat to Garden and the world itself, it sort of makes sense that no-one cared about that so much when the main plot kicked off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> at some point completely forgets to resolve the Occuria situation.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> expansion <em>Broken Steel</em> leaves Colonel Autumn's fate unresolved if you let him walk out of the purifier.

It doesn't even tell you what happened to the main characters. To be fair, though, it is the middle part of a trilogy.

This leaves many things to consider, such as what the UAA really is, who Travis's parents were, who Darkstar was, and, of course, if the events affected the video game's real world or if it really was Silvia's daughter Jeane day dreaming about a picture.

The sequel pretty much confirms that the country-wide infection has more-or-less succeeded. <em>Case West</em> reveals that Frank and Isabella have survived, Frank is suppressing his zombification via Zombrex, and the two are hard at work to get to the bottom of the whole mess.

<ul><li> No matter what you did throughout the entirety of the series, you receive one of three endings with no closure outside of the fate of the Reapers.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Another common complaint is that Shepard only can survive in the Red Ending if you do <em>everything</em> right, but even then, its a split second of his/her torso taking a laboured breath in a pile of rubble. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashCut">Smash Cut</a> to credits, leaving his/her fate completely unknown.</span>

The Helghast fleet has been mostly destroyed. 2. The nuking of Stahl's flagship on the surface of Helghan triggered a massive Petrusite chain reaction which appeared to wipe out <em>all life on the surface</em>, with the obvious exception of Stahl and a few of his soldiers as seen in Stinger mentioned. 3. Considering how powerful the Helghast weapons have become, and how some of their ships warped to Earth, it's possible the attack on Earth has already begun. 4. The ISA forces left at Helghan were either destroyed by the petrusite reaction or stuck flying around the planet in fighters incapable of warp travel, so they probably have no way to get to Earth.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics">Telepath Tactics</a></em>, Igor Bloodbeard and his bandits are the major antagonists of the first arc, but he's never confronted directly, and his forces end up vanishing from the plot rather abruptly with no proper resolution.

While the final canon campaign, The Parish, serves well as a close to the series overall due to it's excitingly paced finale and satisfying visual payoff in the ending cut-scene (compared to most other campaigns), all of the foreshadowing regarding the army's vile treatment of carriers makes it hard to take the survivors' final escape as being a conclusive end to their trials. With no further DLC for Left 4 Dead 2 on the horizon, and Left 4 Dead 3 unconfirmed, it's not looking like we'll know what happened to Coach and the gang for a long while, if ever.

<ul><li> The first and only season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em> ends with a series of dramatic events, including Joan sleeping with JFK, Scudworth being apprehended by the Board of Shadowy Figures, and all the clones being frozen. The show was cancelled and we never learned what became of anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em>, "Wicked Game" (about Dodie's attempts to break her best friend Ginger's relationship with Darren). This is brought up again in a later episode as an offhand comment, so it's assumed that Ginger, Dodie, and Macy patched things up off screen and deal with it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain">never speaking about it again.</a>
</li><li> Near its end, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> got hit by this twice in quick succession. In <em>Hey Arnold! The Movie</em>, Helga confesses her feelings to Arnold, but at the end claims she said it on the heat of the moment. From his unconvinced smile, and the fact that he later flirts with her while dancing tango in "April Fool's Day", it's pretty clear he knows that's not the case. However, he never actually responds to Helga's confession at all. And then, at the end of "The Journal", Arnold finds a map of the San Lorenzo jungle that could lead him to his lost parents' whereabouts. This was intended to be the lead-in to the second <em>Hey Arnold!</em> film, known as "The Jungle Movie", which would've resolved <em>both</em> of these questions, but Craig Bartlett's departure from Nickelodeon, coupled with the low gross of the first film, led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of the series being cancelled. It would be more than a decade before this trope would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> with the announcement of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">The Jungle Movie</a></em> going back into production as a two-part TV movie. It's notable that this was only achieved because of a loving fan base. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedByTheFans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedByTheFans">Fans were intensely driven to help fund the return of the series as a movie</a> and it finally picked up speed in the mid 2010's and led to a full resolution. The end result turned out to be just one movie, but with the door open for potential follow-up installments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em>, "Croquembouche" (about Carver in a food essay contest: Tino does his usual end-of-episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> routine while Carver presents his essay on a French cake, which gives the ep its title, and the ep ends with people applauding Carver's speech, without showing if he won or not)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>, "Izzy or Isn't He?"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> started the "Daemon" storyline during the third season... only to find out that they weren't getting a fourth season. That one was left hanging for years until the TV movie <em>Daemon Rising</em> (which used "It's About Time!" as part of the advertising). Alas, <em>ReBoot</em> ended on <em>another</em> cliffhanger not long after. Other three movies entered into production, and a webcomic is being done on the official <em>ReBoot</em> website to bridge the storyline gap between the old and new material. But then it all ends in <em>another</em> cliffhanger.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">BattleTech Expanded Universe</a></em> animated series, the final two-part episode pits the main characters against the bad guys in a Trial of Possession for the main characters' home planet of Sommerset. When it finally breaks down to a hand to hand fight between the bad guy and the hero, it ends with the hero winning the planet... but not the people, including the hero's brother, who were all spirited off the planet. The series was not continued. However, in a novel set in the same universe, the main character shows up nearly 15 years later. He is presented with the temptation to make an unauthorized attack to retake Sommerset, meaning that the Trial of Possession (much like the rest of the series) had little or no lasting effect on the larger <em>Battletech</em> universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> never resolves the question of what happened to Zuko's mom. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> to ATLA, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, features a character asking the phrase above <em>verbatim</em>. The adressee is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">cut off before she can answer</a>.</em> At least the viewers are given the hint that it was a happy ending. The question is finally answered in a sequel comic book called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheSearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheSearch">The Search</a></em>.

The series was supposed to be picked up for another season, but this fell through due to low ratings.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotix">Robotix</a></em> ended with Nemesis, who had been presumed deceased, still alive in space. If the episodes had been picked up as a full series, he and the other Terrakors would have most likely returned to Skalorr to get revenge on the Protectons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has an odd tendency to start episodes with one plotline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">that somehow activates another</a>, and what happened to initiate the new plotline is rarely, if ever mentioned again:
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> occurred in the episode "A Tale of Two Springfields" when, after the plot had shifted, a badger who had been living in the dog-house tries to reassert itself, but Homer accusingly tells it that they're onto something else now. The episode ends with the badger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">leading an army of badgers to invade Springfield</a> when they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">distracted by a concert</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>.
</li><li> Lampshaded again in a different episode, where a supermarket <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">bagging boy strike</a> tangentially led to the family going on an African safari. As the family drifts down a dangerous river on a <em>very</em> makeshift raft, Homer wonders if the strike back home is over. His rant is cut short when they careen over Victoria Falls. After they survive this, they follow a monkey in hopes of finding their way back to civilization... as Homer continues to rant on why those bag boys don't deserve anything.
</li><li> Interestingly inverted in one episode where Homer, going crazy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingDownTheGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingDownTheGauntlet">Throwing Down the Gauntlet</a> to scare everyone, ends up offending someone who <em>accepts</em> his challenge and he and the family are forced to flee the house while he's waiting on the lawn. At the end of the episode when they return from a failed farming venture, Homer finds his opponent still waiting for him and they end up dueling after all.
</li><li> The episode, "Missionary Impossible", with Homer on an island, where he and a girl are at the top of a tower, which is about to fall into a lava flow with them in it. The episode's plot ends there as they get interrupted by a callback to the telethon fundraiser Homer ran away from in Springfield (and a joke about Rupert Murdoch being so greedy that the show's revenue from commercials and merchandise isn't enough).

According to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckman">the series' entry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, "Writer Michael Markowitz noted (in Sep 1998): "We never formally planned Part II... and I'll never tell what I personally had in mind. I'm hoping to leave it to my heirs, for the inevitable day when Duckman is revived by future generations. Ah, the Spandex suits they'll wear, the hovercrafts they'll fly!"
</li><li> The French and Vietnamese dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> both ended after the second series, leaving fans with a massive, unresolved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>.
<ul><li> One could argue that the series <em>itself</em> ended up like this. While the <em>main</em> plotline was largely resolved, the nature of the Vok aliens (who instigated some of the series' biggest episodes) and the origins of Tarantulas were not explained. This was a result of the series being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">rushed to completion so that the sequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> could begin. Simon Furman eventually revealed that the season 3 finale was originally to be a 3-parter that would end on a cliffhanger, leading in to season 4 - this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a> was to explain Taratulas' origins in detail and his motivations for hating the Vok (and would likely have resulted in Tigerhawk gaining a bigger role as well instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">being thrown conveniently under the bridge</a>). The plot was rushed, and unexplained aspects of the story were left to the comic continuation.

Sonic and Sally realize their emotions for each other and kiss. But that's not it—Snively tells Sonic not to be so happy as it's now <em>his</em> turn, and a mysterious red-eyed figure, revealed in a later interview to be Ixis Naugus, laughs threateningly behind him. Sadly, the show was canceled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> took over ABC.

Harry, who was starting to come around that Spider-Man might not be so bad, goes back to hating him and Peter ultimately quits being Spider-Man and throws the costume into the Hudson River.
</li><li> "Things Change", the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, was about two things. First, it was about Beast Boy finding a Terra look-alike and trying to figure out if it was really her. It was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">confirmed it was her</a> in the comic series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, but the episode itself leaves it ambiguous; fair enough, the moral was having the strength to move on from the past...that said, the second plot is about a completely unexplained conflict between the other four Titans and a random white chameleon thing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">It's never explained what it is, where it came from, why it's causing trouble, or how the Titans will catch it and defeat it.</a> And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> that followed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">never once mentions it.</a>

In two episodes, Surtur wipes out the dwarves of Nidavellir, enslaves Amora the Enchantress, and slaughters Korbinite aliens. A bonus episode on one of the show's DVDs features copious buildup to a confrontation between the Avengers and Surtur. However, since the show didn't receive a third season, this confrontation ends up never taking place.
<ul><li> There were actually several plot threads that were never fully resolved thanks to the canceling of the show. Surtur was just the most noticeable one. Others include Captain America's arrangement with Hela, Maria Hill leading the heroes toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, Hawkeye's love life, the fate of Princess Ravana, Hulk's eventual return to the team, capturing the last of the breakout villains, Stark industries's woes, Wonder Man's possible return, and Ronan the Accuser escaping custody.

Cartoons</a></em> short "Planet Kate" ends on a cliffhanger. We never find out what the alien dogs' mission is or why the map Kate made for a homework assignment happened to fit perfectly as the other half of a real map.
<ul><li> Likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheModifyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheModifyers">The Modifyers</a></em> ended with Agent Xero and Mole managing to reclaim the All-Seeing Eye but she loses her communication ring which the villains, who only know her by one of her other personas, Lacey Shadows, find on the floor.

At the end Razer is convinced that she's still out there somewhere in space and goes off to find her, his hope for doing so causing a Blue Lantern ring to follow him.

And to stand against this new, greater better, Zorro and Scarlet Whip reveal their secret identities to each other. Because a second season never happened, the increased threat to the city and our hero was never resolved. Although strangely, the intro sequence that <em>was</em> made for the second season looks as if they would've gone back on this, showing the former villain a lot as if he'd be the main antagonist again.

With nothing left to lose, the duo decide to recreate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThelmaAndLouise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThelmaAndLouise">Thelma &amp; Louise</a></em> and drive off the bridge. The screen whitens as they do so and were given a "To Be Continued" but the show was cancelled after that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlanetSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlanetSheen">Planet Sheen</a></em> was quietly canceled following the awkward airing of the 24th episode in February 2013 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5wdii');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5wdii" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5wdii');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">gave the series</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect">The Firefly Effect</a> after the third episode aired and the abysmal ratings came in</span>, leaving the series to end on the sad note of Sheen never finding a way to return to Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> originally ended with the title character helping a baby, with no resolution on stopping Aku. Originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> as creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky">Genndy Tartakovsky</a> was to have plans to helm the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">now-cancelled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">Double Subverted</a> as a fifth season was already completed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> ended on a TV Movie, <em>The Doomstar Reqiuem</em>, with Dethklok finally shedding their selfish ways, saving Toki and apparently on the track to godhood. But Offdensen quits being their manager to become the new head of the Church of the Black Klok, Selectia is still plotting something with his Project Falconback and Murderface was pricked by a "fan"'s spiked braclet during the movie which injects him with something and seemingly will sow discord with the band later. So what happens next? Well your guess is as good as anyone else's since Adult Swim and creator, Brendon Small, got into a disagreement over creative differences, resulting in AS ultimately cancelling the series. Even despite fan support, AS refused to budge and Brendon was later quoted stating he was done making music for the series.
</li><li> <em>Oh No! It's an Alien Invasion</em> is about a group of kids battling aliens that have captured and hidden their parents. In the final episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just as the kids find where their parents were hidden, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> gets there first and hides them somewhere else</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fatherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fatherhood">Fatherhood</a></em> episode "The Birds, Bees, and Bindlebeep" ends with Norma announcing to Arthur that she is pregnant with their fourth child and Arthur freaking out about it, because of the show's abrupt cancellation the story was never concluded and the child's gender was never revealed.
</li><li> The British adult claymation series <em>Crapston Villas</em> ended on a cliffhanger as a bus was about to crash into the titular apartment building.
</li><li> The tenth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> is about a dozen of the main characters lost in time due to magical crystals traveling from time to time. As the show was cancelled after that (generally ill-received) season it ends with it never known whether the Smurfs did return to their original time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> was cut short because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheMerchandise">Screwed by the Merchandise</a>. It had a grand finale that did nothing to solve the overarching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Riot, Jem, and Rio. Neither man even learns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle">Jem and Jerrica are the same</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> was confirmed to have ended in late 2018 when series co-creator Tom McGillis revealed that there are currently no plans for any more seasons after <em>The Ridonculous Race</em> which by then had originally aired almost three years earlier. The reason being due to the show's fleeting demographics and the franchise's original reality TV spoofing gimmick no longer being marketable. As a result, many characters (such as Courtney, Harold and Leshawna) were never given proper sendoffs and many more plotlines were never given any kind of resolution. To add further salt to the wound, the sixth season finale ("Lies, Cries, and One Big Prize") ends on the cliffhanger of Dave being left behind on the island with Scuba Bear. Likewise, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> to <em>The Ridonculous Race</em>, as well as the entire show ("A Million Ways to Lose A Million Dollars"), ends with Don telling the viewers to "stay tuned for more Total Drama," implying that TDI will be back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Detentionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Detentionaire">Detentionaire</a></em> ended on a cliffhanger, with most of the main characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">still in Coral Grove after defeating the main villains, one of the (supposedly dead) council members apparently about to attack the school with an army of lizard men, and a number of questions left unanswered (how involved with Coral Grove were Biffy's parents and Jenny's aunt, for example?)</span> The creators did have plans for a fifth season; however, poor viewership in the US (caused by Cartoon Network <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screwing the show over</a>) led to it getting cancelled.
</li><li> Much like its counterparts <em>Young Justice</em> and <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman">Beware the Batman</a></em> was not picked up for another season, so it left behind some loose plot threads, such as Batman's allies coming together as the Outsiders, Harvey Dent becoming Two-Face, and Anarky still playing his twisted games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters">Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters</a></em> was only picked up for 26 episodes rather than the expected 52. This led to some unresolved plot points, such as Rook still being in power and framing the Flex Fighters for crimes they didn't commit, Erika's newfound superpowers, Dr. C being in a coma, Agent Reynolds being replaced by Rook's mysterious ally, the Gentleman having plans for Rook's secret identity, and more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shazzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shazzan">Shazzan</a></em> ended with Chuck and Nancy still wandering the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em> themed world, trying to find the true owner of the rings so they would be returned home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JosieAndThePussycats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JosieAndThePussycats">Josie and the Pussycats</a> In Outer Space</em> ended with the group still wandering space, trying to find Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> ends without Spider-Man finding Mary Jane.

<ul><li> An old joke around this trope; a man living in an apartment building has fallen into the habit of dropping his shoes on the floor when he gets home and takes them off. This causes his downstairs neighbour to complain about the frequent noise. One evening, the man comes home, takes off one of his shoes and drops it, but then remembers his neighbour's complaint and places the other one quietly on the floor beside the first shoe. Hours later, he's going about his thing when he suddenly hears an anguished cry from downstairs: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "For God's sake, drop the other shoe!"</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RimShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RimShot">Ba-dum-tish</a>.
