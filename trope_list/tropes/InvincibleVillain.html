It's reassuring, comforting, and satisfying. Sometimes, that's not an option, though. Evil is just too powerful, too well-prepared, and too embedded in the system. Rather than being able to turf it out for good, the heroes must find a way to live with it, negotiate with it, or simply escape it. This is not just about stories where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> - this is about stories where it was never seriously possible for them to lose.
</p><p>This trope is common in several genres:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a>: The protagonists' insignificance and helplessness in the face of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a> is the whole point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeFiction">Crime Fiction</a>: If the criminals are the heroes and law enforcement are the villains, then it's generally unlikely that our protagonists are going to take down an entire criminal justice system. Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>'s cynical attitude towards the law means the protagonists will often run into one of these, whether they be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">The Don</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a>, or a senior and well-connected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">Tragedy</a>: One easy way for a protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> to destroy them is for them to get into a fight they really, really shouldn't have picked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: War is considerably less defensible as a concept if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">there's no realistic way for you to win</a>, making this trope useful if you want to drive home how awful war is. Meanwhile, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreventTheWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreventTheWar">Prevent the War</a> plot gains extra menace if the other guys you're trying not to pick a fight with are both unpleasant and undefeatable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality">White-and-Grey Morality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>: A fair few stories are based around the idea that cooperation and compromise are far more helpful than violence, and the other guys being invincible is an excellent argument that you should start talking to them rather than trying to batter them into submission.
</li></ul><p>An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> will, by definition, be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> unless they have a change of heart on their own - at which point a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">Karma Houdini Warranty</a> may be waiting in the wings if they experience a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion">Redemption Demotion</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> will usually be one of these unless counterbalanced by a sufficiently effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeParagon">Greater-Scope Paragon</a>. After all, the whole point is that their victory or defeat is outside the scope of the story. On the other hand, not every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> - the story can be all about how the protagonists deal (or fail to deal) with somebody or something they stand no chance of defeating.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a>, and it's perfectly possible to write a good, satisfying story with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>, after all, and the idea that you can't always deal with evil by punching it into submission is an ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a>), but there are plenty of ways to mishandle them. If taken to extremes, when the story is <em>entirely about</em> the villain constantly winning in some contrived way, this trope turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue">Villain Sue</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> is especially at risk to this.

In the one anime fight where someone even lands a worthwhile attack (Doppo counters with several chest crushing punches), Yujiro simply stands up smiling as if he had an itch. To date, nothing has even given him cause to pause. Though several characters have evolved based on his almost unachievable status. Yujiro is so powerful, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even at the very end of the series he still hasn't been defeated. Baki, now the second strongest man alive, attempts to fight Yujiro for the final time.

Well, he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not beaten, but he is humbled enough to hand over the title "World's Strongest Creature" to Baki</span>.

He walks away from series 1 without paying for any of the thousands of lives he consumes - including the protagonist's adoptive father - and series 2 seems set to make him even more sadistic, more amoral, more manipulative, more powerful and much more immortal than before. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the end of <em>Last Order</em>, however, he's somewhat received his comeuppance, as after cloning himself so many times that more than one Nova would pop up for every one killed, he's finally put in indefinite cryogenic stasis so that his death doesn't cause any more Nova clones to pop up. There's still one more Nova clone - Super Nova - left, but he's since grown into his own character who's betrayed his original self for his own goals.</span>

<ul><li> From the Invading Army Arc, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Kagezora Inaba</a>. His Shikai allows him to create portals that are mainly used to cause his opponents to attack themselves. He also created and controls the Reigai, Mod Souls that are essentially stronger and more aggressive copies of the Gotei 13 Captains, Vice Captains, and any other named Shinigami of considerable power, excluding Ichigo, (who's Hollow powers prevent Inaba from making one of him), and Yamamoto (the Strongest of the Gotei). After he's backed into a corner, Inaba reveals he can use his Shikai to teleport, and that he's a Mod Soul himself and can just hijack another Reigai's body to fully heal himself, and turn it into his body, leaving the other Reigai in his old injured body. Then it turns out that he can <strong>endlessly resurrect every single defeated Reigai</strong>, including the one's who had their pill forms destroyed. Then the reigai are revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiters">Power Limiters</a> that, when removed, make the Reigai so powerful that not even the Gotei 13 or Yamamoto (who were already struggling to fight them) can stand a chance against even the weaker ones. He also has the ability to simultaneously absorb Ichigo, Yamamoto (strongest fire Zanpaktou), AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Nozomi Kujo</a> (the ability to hurl an opponent's attack back at them drastically more powerful)'s powers and hurl it back at them, easily defeating Yamamoto, who even Aizen wouldn't take on without negating his power. When Ichigo FINALLY manages to seemingly defeat him using the last of his powers, Inaba reveals that he has a cloning ability that makes Ichigo waste the last of his powers on a clone. Urahara's stealthy tactics that were similiar to a century ago? Inaba is smart enough to catch on and <em>sabotage</em> it with a Reigai of Urahara. Then, Inaba and Nozomi are revealed to be 2 parts of one person, ÅŒko Yushima, who went brain dead after making them. When Inaba captures Nozomi and merges with her to create the Mod Soul ÅŒko, he's revealed to have BOTH Inaba and Nozomi's powers as his Shikai, making him the most powerful villain in Filler. His Shikai is so powerful, it's able to destroy Soul Society with its mere presence.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cumu');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0cumu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cumu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only other thing that powerful in canon is Yamamoto's <strong>Bankai</strong></span> It gets so bad that it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Kon</a> and one of the worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> cop-outs in Bleach filler: the Reigai randomly turn against ÅŒko, sacrificing themselves to stop him from blowing up Soul Society, and Nozomi fighting from within to destroy ÅŒko's Soul Chain (which Mod Souls don't even have), just to make him weak enough that Ichigo is FINALLY able to kill him.
</li><li> Then there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Yhwach</a>, the King of the Quincies, who had gotten so bad that he is considered the Quincy equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Madara Uchiha</a>. He fights against Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, who seems to kill him, but in reality, that was a Quincy named <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Royd Lloyd</span> who can copy appearances and memories, who fought Yamamoto to weaken him while the true Yhwach goes to see and talk with Aizen. The real one shows up, he quickly steals his Bankai (and is apparently the only one strong enough to control it) then kills him effortlessly at that. Ichigo attacks but is soundly defeated. Yhwach leaves only to come back again and take over Soul Society. Then we find out that even if his subordinates are killed, their souls will ultimately empower him because he had given the Quincies their powers (and pieces of his soul) in the first place. Not only that, <em>everyone in Soul Society</em> is infected with pieces of his soul. So every death on the battlefield (Shinigami or Quincy) will give him that person's power, abilities and memories; he gets stronger, no matter what. Ichigo trains and comes back to Soul Society for a showdown... then we find out that this is exactly what Yhwach was waiting for since Ichigo had left a path straight to the Realm of the Soul King. Yhwach goes there, only to encounter Ichibei, the head of the Soul King's elite Squad Zero and an even stronger Soul Reaper than Yamamoto. Ichibei appears to gain an advantage, but Yhwach simply reveals he's been holding back this entire time, and that his Quincy power, "The Almighty," his actual Schrift, essentially gives him the ability to manipulate and nullify <em>any</em> special ability <em>any</em> foe possesses, so long as he knows said power. He also knows about said power instantly if he can only observe it, which he can do effortlessly with his special eyes, which can see everywhere and every<em>when</em>. He's so overwhelmingly powerful that he instantly broke Ichigo's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">true Bankai the very moment after it's revealed, successfully negated Orihime's powers, and rendered Ichigo's new form of unified Hollow and Quincy powers useless</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">Only the Author Can Save Them Now</a> is in full effect, and that requires <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">needing the Fullbringers to repair Ichigo's Bankai, fellow Invincible Villain Aizen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">team up with the heroes</a> and Ishida using a special arrow to reverse the effects of Aushwalein temporarily, allowing Ichigo the time for a finishing blow</span>.

It's so bad that even when Goku <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gains access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan God Form</a> (which is said to be the strongest form a Saiyan can attain)</span>, Beerus is still stronger than him, even when not using his full power. To point it out, he's the only antagonist in the Dragon Ball Z series to never be defeated, only giving up his plans to destroy the world because he's too tired to go through with it. Justified since he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, and his unquestioned power is fundamental to the universe.

Even Super Vegito doesn't actually beat him, despite possessing the capability to; he gets absorbed intentionally in a gambit to free his friends, but this ends up backfiring when he defuses due to Buu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note202qs');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note202qs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note202qs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision">revisioned</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> to be due to a time limit imposed on any species other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Kais</a> using Potara Earrings</span>, and Super Buu subsequently stomps Goku and Vegeta apart, mostly because they can't kill him inside his own body where they're the size of insects. In the end, he's taken down by internal sabotage, when Vegeta yanks out Fat Buu's pod just as Super Buu is about to kill Goku.
</li><li> Goku Black from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, possessed an enhanced Zenkai ability that allows him to get stronger from every bit of damage he takes. Within the span of four battles he goes from being toe-to-toe with a Super Saiyan 2 Goku, to being able to shrug off blows from Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta in his base form before transforming into Super Saiyan RosÃ© and utterly decimating Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks despite all being at their strongest forms. Even Vegeta gaining the upper hand ends up being negated when he simply used his scythe to create clones that quickly overwhelmed both Goku and Vegeta. And with him fusing with Zamasu after the latter suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>, he remains completely undefeated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">will never get the chance to answer for his crimes either</a>. As an added bonus, he is one of the very few villains to never suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> and his compliance with Future Zamasu's request for fusion isn't out of desperation but because he decides to stop playing around. With the exception of his first fight with Goku, which was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">Worf Had the Flu</a> and ended before either one of them could get serious, Black <em>never</em> actually loses a fight.
</li><li> Zamasu himself after he gets his wish for immortality. Any attack inflicted on him has no effect, and once or twice he even allows Black to attack <em>through</em> him to surprise his foes. The Evil Containment Wave would have worked on him, but the heroes flubbed it (and, of course, King Piccolo had broken out of it eventually back when it was used on him). And upon his fusion with Black, he gains not only an immense boost in power but also a permanent Super Saiyan state on top of Black's ability to grow stronger upon taking damage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does gain a bit of a weakness here, in that Black was still mortal so fusing with him weakened his own immortality, but even with that the heroes barely manage to destroy his body. And when they do, he just turns himself in a universe-spanning spiritual entity that annihilates all life on Earth in a heartbeat and begins spreading himself to other timelines. And none of the characters can harm because he no longer has a body. Zeno himself has to erase the entire timeline to put a stop to Zamasu.</span>
</li><li> While he's not a villain, but rather an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a>, Jiren qualifies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of Universe 11 during the Tournament of Power, he was stated to be even stronger than a God of Destruction. Specifically, he's far stronger than Belmod, who's <em>stronger than Beerus</em>. When the time comes for him to battle, he shows some incredibly impressive feats. <em>Nothing</em> seems to make him budge; he's like a brick wall before Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken Goku who is totally unable to hurt him at all, he breaks out of Hit's Time Manipulation techniques and knocks him out with one punch, and takes down Super Saiyan Blue Evolution Vegeta (who defeated a God of Destruction in training) with <em>two</em> hits after pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> of his offense when it finally looked like someone was actually making him sweat. When Goku gains Ultra Instinct, it's no good, as Jiren is <em>still</em> stronger. It's only by gaining the Mastered Ultra Instinct that Goku (or anyone) is <em>finally</em> able to damage Jiren and fight on par with him- but that only lasts a short while before the sheer <em>strain</em> of trying to fight at Jiren's level practically destroys Goku's body and causes him to collapse. Jiren is so insanely strong that when he actually goes to full power, even the aforementioned <em>Beerus</em> is sweating and quaking in terror, wondering how a single warrior could have so much energy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually goes down with the combined efforts of Goku and Frieza in the series finale, although by that time Goku had managed to make Jiren use up most of his overwhelming power in the Mastered Ultra Instinct fight, so he was about on their level at that point. Even <em>then</em>, Goku stated that he would absolutely <em>slaughter</em> them if for the technicality that they could win by knocking him out of the ring. It takes the remaining heroes using up all their strength <em>just to push him a few feet</em>.</span>
<ul><li> In the manga, Goku lampshades his seeming invincibility.
<div class="indent"><strong>Goku:</strong> He still had that much power left!? No matter how much power he expends, there's always more!

But even though he's supposedly been dead for a while, he comes back as an immortal, regenerating being with unlimited chakra, a massive Susanoo that causes a high degree of damage by swinging its sword, and capable of creating clones indistinguishable from himself and as powerful as him. Seven of the strongest people in existence barely inconvenienced him; even Naruto has failed to significantly hinder him. But even when it seems that the heroes finally found a way to beat him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">he simply pulls out a new ability from nowhere</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">any unexpected event happens which plays to his advantage</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">even if was previously shown that it is impossible</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states he has no weaknesses. Though one of the morals of the series was supposed to be that the new generations would surpass the old, but apparently to Madara this does not apply. As it stands, he has almost every power in the series available to him, and is inexplicably more powerful than anything that should be able to kill or wound him. Kishimoto stated at Jump Festa 2014 that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">Only the Author Can Save Them Now</a> had hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock">Writer's Block</a> at this point. The solution he came up with was for Madara to be backstabbed by Kaguya ÅŒtsutsuki, one of only two beings who is truly stronger than him, and her to take over as the villain. And then Kaguya puts up much less of a fight then Madara ever did (so that there is less than any other antagonist in the series) and is defeated in about ten chapters while it took Madara over a hundred (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">nearly a sixth of the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">entire series</a></em>) to finally go down.</span>

Slifer the Sky Dragon gains 1000 ATK and DEF for every card in Malik's hand, and Revival Jam protected Slifer from every attack, thanks to the Trap Card Jam Defender and the Jam revived itself after every destruction. And two Spell Cards allowed him to ignore the limit of having six hand cards in the end of every turn, and drawing three cards by every revival. However, Yami Yugi used this strategy against him and he brainwashed Revival Jam, so Slifer's effect forced it to attack Revival Jam automatically and destroying it immediately. But since Revival Jam always revived itself after every destruction, Slifer's effect cannot be stopped, and Malik was forced to draw three new cards whenever Revival Jam was revived due to his own Spell Card. The resulting loop caused Malik to deck out and lose the duel.

He is also the first to lose in the Battle Royale, and Jonouchi would have beaten him fairly had he not played a Shadow Game under Malik's rule and fall unconscious. The only person he really gives trouble is Yugi. In every duel, he inflicts physical and/or psychological pain to his opponents, already an unfair advantage.

Even a set of cards specifically designed to counter his playstyle gets countered after Zarc wised up to how he was previously beaten.

The encounter ends with half the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a> on the floor spitting up blood, and Slade quipping that this League, made up mostly of new faces (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> terms, anyway) to superheroing, is so much weaker than the old one... despite the fact that many of them (Wally in particular) are <em>far</em> more powerful than their predecessors.

He even went as far as defeating the <em>incarnation of the universe</em>. The only way he was defeated was because of his own error, and it's implied he partially did it on purpose. In fact, virtually all the times he acquires ultimate power and fails to win are implied to be due to his subconscious desire to lose.

He was a reality warper who could rewrite history, summon armies of monsters, and make himself immune to physical attacks and weapons, including Thor's hammer. During the final battle, Thor mentions his powers have conveniently weakened, allowing Thor to beat him. Loki suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> in later appearances where he was reduced to the traditional illusions and feats of sorcery.

In his timeline, despite having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>, he singlehandedly took over the world and the only heroes left to fight him, he only left alive because he was bored and could have killed them at any point he wished. During his fight with Silver, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sells</a> everything thrown at him. About the only thing that can hurt him are his own attacks.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperboyPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperboyPrime">Superboy-Prime</a> not only went from good to bad, but also from a sympathetic hero who lost his universe to a whiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who had all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s power level, with none of his weaknesses, as his universe's Krypton had been swallowed by its Sun, and thus there was no Kryptonite that could harm him, and magic seemed to have little effect either for unexplained reasons (red sun radiation still works though). The result was a superpowered, adolescent jerk on a cosmic tantrum who could effortlessly destroy entire universes and tear through countless heroes without getting a scratch, and any setback was at most temporary. Ironically, the one time karma finally gets him is when he finally gets what he wants: to return home. Since his world is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">our own</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">the fan backlash</a> has trapped Prime in his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a>.

He's also immune to kryptonite and can use his powers under a red sun. He's angsty about his looks, despite looking a manly sideburned deathly pale rockstar with chiseled abs. He easily defeats Superman, Supergirl, Superboy, the Teen Titans, and the Justice League. He steals Superman's Fortress of Solitude and locks Superman out of it. He quickly romances Supergirl. He not only succeeds in going back in time to save Krypton, but rule it (after killing Jor-El, Faedora, and General Zod.)

His new Rot-based powers allow him to instantly kill, turn undead, and take control of any living thing that has even a single dead cell in it, anywhere in the entire world at any time, in unlimited numbers as well as reshape them into any shape desired as well. There are no functional limits to this power, only that champions of the Green and Red can sometimes resist it. He is also effectively unkillable as he can just reform a body from any corpse anywhere in the world.

Since then Otto has returned several times, but has yet to actually lose a battle against Peter Parker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And his appearance during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire">Secret Empire</a></em> has him effortlessly taking over Parker Industries and turning Peter into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a> again.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> devolved into this during his early years. Most notably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaximumCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaximumCarnage">Maximum Carnage</a></em>, where he continuously bounces back from all the heroes' attempts to destroy him with ease, even when they tried using traditional Symbiote weaknesses like fire and sound waves. Nowadays, he's still dangerous, but he's no longer the unstoppable powerhouse he was before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a></em> may be the <em>the</em> most triumphant example of this in Marvel Comics. Introduced with the ability to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">undetectable robotic duplicates of himself that often weren't aware themselves they weren't the real thing</a>, these were shamelessly used from the character's debut to allow him to always escape justice in some fashion, either by using a Doombot to serve as a decoy at the last minute or, increasingly, actually carrying out entire plans by proxy so nothing could be legally traced to him. This built up a decades-long reputation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badassery</a>, and as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">writers themselves began to buy into it</a>, the character grew increasingly presented as less of the megalomaniacal madman he had been created as and more as being legitimately as good as he thought himself. To this day, Doom has one of the highest "win counts" of any supervillain, <em>anywhere</em>. According to the Marvel wiki, including alternate versions and in other media, he's killed more named characters than <em>Thanos</em>. <br/><br/>A Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> issue shows what would have happened if Doom had managed to keep the Beyonder's power, which results in him winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars</a>, acquiring Thanos' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">dominating the cosmos</a>. This attracts the attention of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Celestials</a> whom Doom eventually defeats in a war that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">destroys the planet</a>. Using the last of his power, Doom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">recreates Earth and humanity with it before becoming mortal himself in order to lead them to greatness</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in the sense that Doom becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> instead of a villain as the story progresses.

The movie dances around this issue by setting up the all-out battle to occur after the story's events, but it's impossible to maintain any hope for the surviving characters because victory is ultimately impossible.

Yes, they are universally hostile. Yes, they as as intelligent as they were before death. Yes, they're shown to be almost completely unkillable, save complete immolation (though in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead">first film</a> doing this only allowed the trioxid to spread further). However, it helps that they're mostly comedic villains, and their hunger for brains prevents them from thinking rationally in most situations, allowing the highly resourceful protagonists to frequently (albeit temporarily) incapacitate them through various forms of dismemberment. And though they appear to win in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead">original film</a>, this was mostly due to the military's blunders, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDeadPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDeadPartII">first sequel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> this, and gives them a new weakness in electricity.

They're explicitly fighting Death, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithFightingDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithFightingDeath">presumably eternal force of nature</a>.

The villain Sutter Cane is the author figure of the entire movie, and just makes any changes he wants to the story no matter how implausible or crushing to the protagonist's goals. Trent never stood a chance of defeating him; he's just words in Cane's imagination. The meanest part is that not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">Only the Author Can Save Them Now</a> applies here (except out-of-universe). Cane is both the villain and the author, and won't save Trent from ceasing to exist when the story ends.
</li><li> The Tall Man from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm">Phantasm</a></em> films. No matter what our heroes do, he will always come back for them, often pulling a new power out of his ass in the process. The series is designed to feel like a nightmare, and every nightmare needs a guy whom you can never hope to defeat and can only stay ahead of for a bit. Even if you do manage to kill him, a copy of him will almost instantly appear where the previous one died. He's actually an evil entity from another dimension who is using an old man it killed as an avatar to enter our world. It has also made copies of its host so it can keep coming back. There are tens of thousands of them. The only ways to permanently defeat him would be to kill all of his copies (and considering how hard it is to kill just one, that would be nigh impossible), use the dimensional gate to travel to his dimension to try and destroy his true form, or travel back in time to stop the gate from being used to bring him into our world (almost pulled off at one point but ultimately failed).
</li><li> Matt "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManiacCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManiacCop">Maniac Cop</a>" Cordell of the film series of the same name pushes this even by 80's slasher villain standards. He seems to have the same unexplained powers as Jason Voorhees (super strong, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, undead), but is also quite intelligent and tactical, capable of using guns, driving cars, and framing others for his killings. These things together, not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomAtkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomAtkins">Tom Atkins</a> last long, and at the end of each film the best the surviving heroes can do is survive for a few days longer or give him what he wants. One character even explicitly states that all the cops in the world can't stop Cordell, even though you'd think bodily dismemberment or blowing him to giblets would still be viable options.
</li><li> John "Jigsaw" Kramer from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em> franchise. He always wins, and gets away with his crimes. Even when he gets killed, he <em>still</em> wins.

In both films, his titular rampages go exactly according to plan, and he kills nearly a hundred innocents per film with out even a scratch, and gets away Scott-free by either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a> or by faking his death. In his defense, most of his victims are unarmed civilians who can't fight back, but even when the authorities do manage to engage him, his homemade Kevlar suit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a> make him pretty much unbeatable. The closest anyone came to landing a blow on him was in the first film, where a civilian tackled him from behind and called to the others to help him disarm Williamson, but this scene just serves to show why such a tactic wouldn't work, as Bill somehow manages to slit the man's throat with an army knife we saw him equip earlier and gun down the the other civvies in retaliation, even though the man was on his back, and Bill was in a physically constraining Kevlar suit. Subverted in the final movie where he once again takes out loads of FBI and SWAT personnel who've come to apprehend or take out someone who's by then become the biggest mass murderer in American history, but he finally bites it at the end.

</li><li> The South Korean film <em>Kundo Age of the Rampant</em> has a pretty blatant example in the person of antagonist Jo Yoon. Even though the kundo bandits are shown to be powerful warriors, Jo Yoon is completely untouchable in every single scene, slaughtering tens of warriors by himself largely without effort, often in a single sword-swing. The closest to a hit being landed on him for most of the film is the loss of his topknot (and even that doesn't make much of an impression, since he has one immediately afterwards) and a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">single cut on his cheek from his dying father</span>. He is naturally gifted and destined to be awesome. Being a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> doesn't make him any more enjoyable.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Kayako Saeki</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge">The Grudge</a></em>. Once you've been affected by her curse, it's not a matter of <em>if</em> you'll die, but <em>when</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">how horrible your death will be</a>. The underlying theme of the films is that there is no way to stop her curse. It's only a matter of time before it takes your life. Attempting to hide or seek help will only spread the curse farther. Also, Kayako and her son Toshiro can attack you from virtually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">anywhere</a></em>.
</li><li> The villain in the supernatural slasher <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellMeHowIDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellMeHowIDie">Tell Me How I Die</a></em> is an advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">precog</a> who can flawlessly see months into the future. He's always at least five steps ahead of the main characters, and although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">some of his victims definitely deserved their fate</a>, his killing spree goes off without a hitch and he escapes before the police can find him. Even when the heroine acquires precognitive abilities of her own in order to predict his moves, he still outperforms her.

The former two are beaten handily and it just got worse from there any time someone challenges him. Granted there were moments the heroes do wound him, particularly the battle on Titan, but it took an insane amount of teamwork to even come close due to the fact Thanos had most of the gems by that point. But once Thanos gains the fourth gem, this comes into full effect. All the heroes fighting in Wakanda get brushed aside like nothing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Scarlet Witch destroying Vision and his gem yields nothing because Thanos can <em>rewind time</em> by that point, and even when Thor finally arrives and goes for a killing blow, Thanos still survives and manages to carry out his plan and wipe out half of the life in the universe</span>. And even despite all of that, Strange had stated that, through a meditation spell to look through <em>14 million timelines</em>, there was only <em>one</em> possible way to beat him. So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureGambit">this whole outcome</a> <em>was the best solution</em>. Ironically though come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thanos gets subdued by the Avengers and <em>killed</em> in first twenty minutes of the movie after being this trope previously albeit he is already severely weakened by using the Gauntlet to destroy the stones anyway so it can't even be called a satisfying victory.

<ul><li> Five seasons and nothing but increasingly unlikely victories for Ramsay. This guy may as well be despair in human form Â— if he doesn't somehow win himself, his psychologically broken or nearly as despicable cronies will make sure things still go his way. The first thing that can be considered a loss for him (outside of succession issues) is Theon and Sansa escaping Winterfell in the Season 5 finale, but he obviously wasn't around to intervene. He can even kill the Warden of the North (his own father, Roose Bolton) in his own chamber, in front of his bannerman and a Maester, and then kill the Warden's wife and newborn son in a public setting without any trouble. His villainy never backfires on him, and in fact he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">easily crushes</a> the combined forces of the Northerners and Wildlings rallying against him during the Battle of the Bastards. It takes thousands of knights pouring in from the Vale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">literally out of nowhere</a> to defeat him, which he had absolutely no way of planning for.

Even Daenerys' long-awaited invasion of Westeros, when it finally comes, gets called off before Cersei can be dethroned, due to the looming threat of the White Walkers and their army from the North. And as of the end of Season 7, she is plotting to raise a mercenary army (with suddenly revealed funds that are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> in their own right) and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">backstab</a> the Targaryen-Stark alliance when they are at their most vulnerable.

The end of the fifth book and released preview chapters from the sixth book imply that he will have taken the throne from the much despised Cersei and will be the one opposing Daenerys when she finally arrives on Westeros against a much more united kingdom. Removing him from the story, however, has put the writers in a bind where they have showed that Cersei has angered every one of the kingdoms, destroyed the main temple of the most prominent Westerosi religion, violated numerous taboos, and all in all should be able to count her loyal supporters on one hand with fingers to spare. However, as the main villain, she still has to remain a credible threat to actually give Dany something of a challenge in the series, the plot bends over backwards to give her lucky breaks.

While he's around, he's able to overpower Sylar effortlessly, as well as killing off nearly every major baddie the show had cultivated up to that point. Realizing their mistake, the writers deemed him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooPowerfulToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooPowerfulToLive">Too Powerful to Live</a> and had the three most powerful non-Arthur characters come together to kill him for good. Embodies this trope to a much greater degree than Sylar, because Sylar's rise to godhood occurred over the course of the series and stemmed from his own determinator persistence and cleverness; Arthur's ascent occurred offscreen and before the main storyline, and comes without any real emotional baggage, so there's no sense that he was ever particularly vulnerable.

After the "Spygate" incident during the 2007 season, the Patriots were disciplined for videotaping the New York Jets' football signals with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell ruling that it was a violation of league rules and fair play; the NFL fined Belichick $500,000 and the Patriots $250,000, and took away their first round draft pick. In the long run, this proved to be ineffective, when after missing the 2008 playoffs, they would win the #1 conference seed and home field advantage throughout the playoffs in 2010 (14-2), 2011 (13-3), 2014 (12-4) where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, 2016 (14-2) where they made a second half comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime, and 2017 where they held on to the #1 seed en route to Super Bowl LII, only to lose to the Philadelphia Eagles 41-33.

<ul><li> In the territorial days, promoters sometimes used Invincible Villain gimmicks to push physically larger, stronger wrestlers as unstoppable. The storylines were usually formulaic: The heel would systematically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">beat down</a> a series of jobbers, before easily defeating any of the low- to mid-card wrestlers and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">several of the highlight wrestlers</a>... all of them being completely one-sided matches where the villain would not so much as flinch against even the most powerful blows their foes tried. This, naturally, would eventually set up a confrontation between the lead babyface wrestlers (especially if he were champion) or, during the territorial days, a "special appearance from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">AndrÃ© the Giant</a>," who would ultimately find a weakness in this wrestler and hand him a loss.

</li><li> In the summer of 1989, the WWF (as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> was then known) pushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinyLister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinyLister">Tiny Lister</a> Jr.'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoHoldsBarred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoHoldsBarred">No Holds Barred</a></em> character Zeus as an unstoppable, undefeatable villain who posed a genuine threat not only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s World Championship, but Hogan's well-being as well. This was done without the (apparent) benefit of putting Zeus in a series of squash matches against jobbers and low-carders on TV (to build Zeus' in-ring persona and get his moveset over) ... but eventually, the trope became averted.

Of course, the "villain" part only applies due to his angle and whenever he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a> (which he hadn't been from 2003 until 2016, when he became The Authority's hired gun to battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a> for (kayfabe) control of the WWE). He was at his most insufferably invincible during his "Big Evil" phase in late 2001-2002. Throughout this time period he would go through a series of <em>extremely</em> one sided feuds that involved him beating the piss out of whatever babyface unfortunate enough to get in his way <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">getting away with it.</a>
</li><li> For a couple years after being recognized both in-story and out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s son-in-law, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> could never lose a major match. Thanks to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">part of Vince's family</a>, "Trips" is pretty squarely heel, though occasionally a lesser of two evils. Triple H actually turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">Face</a> shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 22 in 2006 all the way until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2013, and was actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> during that period of time instead.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">New World Order</a> faction in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> was a notable example of an entire <em>group</em> of invincible villains. This was especially evident in the group's early days, where the nWo would frequently run roughshod over their WCW foes and episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></em> would end with the nWo triumphant more often than not.
</li><li> In 2012, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a> (who was Senior Vice President of Talent Relations in the WWE) became the GM of Raw and SmackDown, and before the interim GM of Raw. The issue with his character wasn't that he didn't play it well (he did), but that, as a heel GM, it seemed no one could ever outsmart him, and his character nearly took over the show, getting more air time than some of the wrestlers combined. It got so bad that Vince's "firing" of John at No Way Out was welcome because someone FINALLY was able to outsmart him, despite their appreciation for how well John played the role. This is because a heel boss usually only works if some wrestlers, preferably baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a>, are able to outsmart them, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> finding a way around Vince's stacking the deck at many points during their feud in 99. Vince seemed to have things work, but Austin found a way around it. This hasn't been the case with some of the more recent heel GMs that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> has put out there, where it might take months for any heel GM to get their comeuppance due to them either being way too smart, having way too many allies, or just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenInertia">on TV way too long during a show</a>. However, heel GMs (Laurinaitis, especially), as well as some other heels, when they finally get beat, might draw some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> from fans who insist that a character has been ruined, or that the WWE did something awful because they lost a battle if they like something about the character to a fault.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a> seemed to teeter on this. Most believe the angle was only around because the WWE writers didn't really have any other major heel stables to work with, and for the few weeks right after Summerslam 2013, it did seem like they were becoming that (how many shows in a row did we really have to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> get beat up the exact same way to end the show before we got the point?).
<ul><li> This was right when just about everyone thought that the WWE was booking Bryan extremely weakly, and the heel wrestler in the angle was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, who hasn't always been the best person outside of kayfabe.
</li><li> The explicit leaders of the Authority, Triple H and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> both dove headfirst into this; <em>especially</em> Stephanie. They almost always came out on top in whatever they were doing and anything that seemed like it would or should finally defeat them or at least get them off TV would only turn out to be a minor setback and be completely undone within a few weeks. While Triple H is willing to put over other guys in matches (like Daniel Bryan at Wrestlemania 30 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> in the months after that) he still defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> in his WWE debut match. Stephanie was much worse about it, since she always made others look like fools (even her own allies) if they annoyed her in any way and, since her attention was almost exclusively aimed at the male roster, nobody was allowed to physically retaliate against her the way it normally would be in a wrestling setting, but were almost never allowed to come out on top against her with words either.
</li><li> Despite being made to look like a weak, sniveling, pathetic coward outside of matches, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> ultimately fits the bill of an Invincible Villain. Much like the other members of the Authority, he pretty much always wins, and on the off-chance he loses, chances are there will be a rematch where Rollins wins and gets the last laugh over whatever Babyface stood in his way (prime examples being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>, John Cena, Randy Orton, and Brock Lesnar). His WWE World Heavyweight Championship reign ended prematurely due to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReaLLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReaLLifeWritesThePlot">injury</a>, but upon his return, he was immediately thrust back into the top Heel role and within a month, defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> (who is often labeled a boring invincible hero) clean to win the title back (though he ended up losing it to Dean Ambrose minutes later thanks to Money in the Bank). Later, he was made the very first pick in the 2016 Draft. As the Monday Night Messiah he continues to do things "for the greater good" and generally wins his feuds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> in general was this during their first months of existence. They would frequently interfere in both matches containing their members and matches containing other wrestlers, and rarely ever got any real punishment, as the matches would usually be thrown out as a result of their antics. However, for some reason, fans still liked them despite all this. Eventually, it came out that they were under the AuthorityÂ’s orders, but just when it looked like they could be the ones to stop them, Rollins betrayed the group and disbanded it.
</li></ul></li><li> While generally Invincible Villain gimmicks are legitimately used to push <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterHeel">Monster Heels</a>, there have been times where the trope was grossly misused or misapplied. One famous example was the WWF's <em>Saturday Night's Main Event</em> in 1988, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MrFuji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MrFuji">Mr. Fuji</a> promised viewers that his latest find, the Super Ninja, would not only defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a> for the Intercontinental Championship, he would virtually destroy him ... all while Super Ninja acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> and doesn't so much as even flinch at Warrior's most powerful moves. Of course, Warrior turned that trick right around and destroyed Super Ninja (a masked Rip Oliver, of the Pacific Northwest Wrestling league, who from time to time served as a jobber to WWF wrestlers) and foiled Fuji's plans for world domination ... at least in the world of the WWF.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>'s director of wrestling operations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontelVontaviousPorter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontelVontaviousPorter">MVP</a> after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceÂ–Heel Turn</a>. He was free to pit World Heavyweight Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricYoung">Eric Young</a> in as many hopeless matches as he saw fit, in order to soften him up for what MVP considered to be an inevitable title victory at the next pay per view, silencing any dissent among the baby faces with suspensions, unwanted matches, or simply not allowing them to be booked. His momentum ended up being halted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">by his own knee injury,</a> which just resulted him throwing all his power behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley">Bobby Lashley</a>, which in turn led to MVP losing his power thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> called the Board of Directors, allowing Lashley to become champion but also giving Bobby some vulnerability, despite MVP's claims to the contrary.
</li><li> Because of her status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a> received a lot of accomplishments from the moment of her debut including having a rather long win-lose record (to the point she was undefeated in single matches for sixteen PPVs), is rarely pinned in non-single matches that she didn't win, becoming the only woman to win all single Woman's Championship (with the exception of the original Women's Championship) and breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>' record of most Women's Championship won by a woman faster than it took Trish to earn that record, ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai">Asuka's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenWinLossStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenWinLossStreak">914-undefeated streak</a> and even defeating Trish Stratus herself.

<ul><li> The first major invincible villain introduced is Jack Noir, especially after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gaining the power of the First Guardians</span>. He's described in-story as being "omnipotent", and while this may not quite be true, the power he has displayed was enough to destroy planets, curb-stomp god-tiers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill universes</span>, and rampage throughout the universes completely unchecked. Act 5 Act 2 has been unofficially named "Jack Noir kills everyone" by the author, and he's not joking. By the time the characters can finally challenge him, he's rendered completely irrelevant, and has yet to be killed because everyone is too busy focused on:
</li><li> Lord English, who has all the problems you'd expect when you establish your villain as completely invincible, even retroactively so. Universes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, ghosts, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Andrew Hussie</span>, you name it, he can kill it in a single shot. As for manipulation skill?

Okay, so some of that was due to his omniscient right-hand, who also only gets killed thanks to him <em>wanting to die</em>, but it still counts. Each new revelation about his backstory shows how Sburb (and its variations) bent over backwards to make him the villain he is today.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> has the main villain Xykon who certainly counts. He has defeated the Order in every encounter but one, though the heroes (or just plain luck) have always done just enough to keep Xykon from achieving his goal: gaining access to one of the Gates. This includes the fact that Xykon has gone up against some of the most powerful mortals in the world in pursuing the Gates and simply overpowered them through sheer magical force. The only time he has actually been defeated by the Order was in their first encounter where he was brought down more by the fact that he was fooling around too much than by any skill on the part of the heroes, and even then he was able to escape pretty easily by virtue of the fact that Roy and crew didn't know how Liches work at the time. Even if the Order did know about his phylactery then, it's still protected by numerous epic level enchantments and it's extremely questionable whether they would have been able to destroy it even if they had captured it.
</li><li> Donald Na from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero">Weak Hero</a></em>. Not only has he never lost a fight, but he's never been hit <em>period</em>. When Ben, the third strongest fighter in the webtoon, faces off against him in middle school, he's unable to land a single one of his punches- and that he manages to last more than a few minutes against Donald is considered an incredible accomplishment in itself.

It was he, not King Yemma, who was the first to run Snake Way. All the good guys are terrified of him, especially Krillin. He is shown to be so powerful that even lifeless objects are afraid of him, and activate the moment his name is spoken because they "just know better". Popo can even appear in the real world and attack people. Popo has also demonstrated the ability to invade other abridged series. When the sun is blown up in the first abridged Cooler movie, Popo puts the sun back just like that. None of the good guys ever stand up to him, and it is shown that he is the boss of Kami. When Garlic Jr. and his minions invade the lookout, Popo easily kills them all. Popo never gets punished in any way for his crimes, as the heroes are too weak next to him to do anything. Popo is a rare version of this trope in that most fans actually like him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue">because he's an overpowering villain played for laughs</a>.

In his debut appearance, he's managed to survive everything that's thrown at him. That includes various weaponry, burying him under rocks, and the <em>detonation of an entire Energon mine</em>. And when he reveals his robot mode, he's still as much of a powerhouse as before as he nearly kills Wheeljack and Ultra Magnus, who were only saved by Optimus's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment. He later goes on to <em>beat Optimus in a straight-on fight</em>, the same Optimus who can regularly go toe-to-toe with Megatron. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And later still, he gets in a fight with Megatron and would've most likely won had Starscream not interfered.</span> By the time the series ends, he's only got <strong>one</strong> loss to his name and that's with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Unicron-possessed Megatron</a>.

Anytime XANA did something to try to defeat them, they'd ultimately defeat his scheme and move forward. This continued until after they materialized Aelita, wherein they began to realize that XANA had set up the chessboard in his favor the whole time. From then on, the characters continuously failed to do anything except stop the flavor-of-the-week attack, repeatedly failing to make any real progress in stopping XANA, and as the series continued to its conclusion, XANA kept getting huge wins that set the whole team further back each time.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">First, they materialize Aelita, but she has to return to Lyoko because XANA managed to bind her to Lyoko with a virus (which later turned out to be Aelita's memories as a human), and as a result they can't shut the super-computer down as it also puts Aelita in a death-like state. Jeremy creates a program to detect when Lyoko is attacked, only for XANA to use this program repeatedly to trick the warriors onto Lyoko to attack with his new monster, the Scyphozoa. They eventually get dragged in to a huge trap and he escapes Lyoko, ultimately allowing them to shutdown the super-computer now, but this no longer defeats XANA. They begin working on a way to find him on the internet, only for XANA to immediately destroy each sector one-by-one, and take over one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">own members</a> as his powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">general</a> and destroy Lyoko. Jeremy manages to restore Lyoko, only to find XANA is using fake Lyoko's to produce powerful machines in order to wage war against the whole. They finally get a small handle on this problem...only for it to be revealed that XANA has created hundreds of such Lyoko copies, whose data resources he uses to create the Kolossus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> whose strength essentially makes it nearly impossible for them to progress. It takes a program specifically <em>designed</em> to destroy XANA to defeat him, but it comes at Franz Hopper's life. Sadly for the team, even <em>that</em> ultimately fails, since in two alternate sequel continuities, XANA survives.</span>

Green Beetle might have been able to win, but he hacks and destroys his Scarab. He's FINALLY defeated when Blue Beetle and his Scarab working together hack and destroy his Scarab. And even though destroying a Scarab is usually fatal for all but a Martian, Black STILL survives, albeit now powerless.</span></li></ul></li></ul></div>
