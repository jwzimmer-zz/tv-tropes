See what happens when you make bad decisions — namely, choosing the Other Guys subpar cable services. For example:
<div class="indent"> "When you wait forever for the cable guy, you get bored. When you get bored, you start staring out windows.

Call 1-800 DirecTV."
</div></li><li> Time Warner Cable had one once which was nearly as bad. The spot featured Mike O'Malley holding a small puppy, saying that since cable cost less than satellite, the money could be used to buy things like dog food and that puppies love dog food so that the simple conclusion must be that satellite <em>hates</em> puppies.
</li><li> Cablevision has played it straight many times, with ads promising better picture because the pixels on your TV will be happier on Cablevision, or that Verizon is a phone company, and therefore too busy to provide you with internet service (ironic, considering Cablevision's primary job is to provide you with TV, not Internet). Some of their commercials from a few years ago were mistaken for parodies.
</li><li> Toshiba used a similar argument in one commercial to tout their shock-proof hard drives, because if a power station tech drops his laptop and breaks the hard disk, then it causes a glitch and the power will go out. If that happens, then your milk will spoil. If that happens, you'll drink the spoiled milk and turn into a zombie, then bite your roommate, who will then bite others until zombies roam the land. So dropped laptop = <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, and that's why shock-proof hard drives are good. It's ostensibly played for comedy, but the ad offers up a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> when you notice that the guy following this loony-bin train of logic is the <em>president of the company</em>.
</li><li> Toast always lands buttered-side down. Cats always land on their feet. So, what happens when you tape toast, buttered-side up, on a cat's back? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Z8yW5cyXXRc">Infinite energy!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In Latin America, during the 2014 edition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a>, DirecTV advertised the then-upcoming football league seasons by telling the viewer about what would supposedly happen if they missed them (a sequence of very improbable events leading to a bad situation). One commercial's logic procedure goes from the viewer missing an important match to <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_GMo10rT7g">waking up in a dried ditch in the street<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

He's a guy who has gone through an extraordinary amount of tragedy throughout his life, and when his back is broken and Wally West (the then-current Flash) refuses to use time-travel to fix Hunter's spine, Hunter accidentally turns himself into Zoom, a speedster much faster than Wally. He resolves to use his powers to make Wally experience tragedy, believing it will motivate Wally into becoming a better hero... see the flaw there? If Hunter's logic was as foolproof as he believed it to be... <em>he himself would be a great hero!</em> But he's not. It seems like Hunter's just looking for an excuse to beat up on Wally for not fixing his spine, though later events show that he's really just that insane, as a side-effect of his powers.

Despite the fact that she offered sanctuary to the rebels because they were her friends and her wife was killed by one of Death Queen's monsters, before Satasha's eyes no less.

The thought of calling out Death Queen's followers for the attack never crosses her mind. In short: she wants to avenge her beloved by siding with the party directly responsible against the other party which used to be friends with her and had nothing to do with it because they lead their enemies to her home in the first place.
</li><li> In the fourth "classic" Paperinik story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> mentions that Paperinik (his own superhero/antihero alter ego) could solve Scrooge's current problem but is told that a think-tank of scientists established that Paperinik doesn't actually exist because Scrooge used a Paperinik-looking robot to advertise his wax museum, hence he was a robot all the time, even when he stole Scrooge's bed while he was sleeping on it. Somehow, not only the whole Duckburg has bought it, <em>Scrooge himself did</em>, at least until they see Paperinik in person.
</li><li> The Order of the Dragon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson">Crimson</a></em> are a knightly order that not only hunts evil monsters that threaten mankind, but also <em>angels too</em> with the purpose of harvesting their organs into battle-drugs.

Initially, they think they encountered future versions of themselves, and were horrified, so Rodimus decided to prevent this fate... by cutting his arm off. That's because his dead self has two arms, and if he will have only one, then dead him will not be the same as living him. And to make sure he'll stay a different person from him, he instructed his crew to not repair his arm.
</li><li> And then there's Whirl. At one point he acknowledges that he was specifically ordered not to engage, which he is going to interpret as a veiled order to engage because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">not engaging just feels wrong, like fighting in the wrong direction</a>.

<div class="indent">1. A sheet of paper is an ink-lined plane. <br/>2. An inclined plane is a slope up. <br/>3. A slow pup is a lazy dog. <br/>4. Therefore, a lazy dog is a sheet of paper.

Pick it up again, pull its legs off, put it down again and tell it to walk. It will stay where it is. This proves that pulling the legs off a spider causes it to go deaf.

</li><li> Why are fire trucks red? It's because they have eight wheels and four people on them, and four plus eight makes twelve, and there are twelve inches in a foot, and one foot is a ruler, and Queen Elizabeth was a ruler, and Queen Elizabeth was also a ship, and the ship sailed the seas, and there were fish in the seas, and fish have fins, and the Finns fought the Russians, and the Russians are red, and fire trucks are always Russian" around, so that's why fire trucks are red.

<ul><li> The explanation of L-space: Books contain knowledge. Knowledge is power. Power is energy. Energy = matter. Matter equals mass. Mass distorts spacetime. Therefore, a well-stocked library or bookstore invariably becomes a labyrinthine lattice of literature connected to every other book that could ever exist, as anyone whos ever gotten lost in a bookstore knows.

</li><li> One auditor who has accidentally-on-purpose become human engages in some intentional Insane Troll Logic to trap the aforesaid Auditors, such as putting up a sign that says "Do Not Feed the Elephant" next to an empty cage, a sign with an arrow pointing left but having the word RIGHT on it, and a sign that simply says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Duck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Duck">Duck!</a> with neither a waterfowl present nor a reason to lower one's head.

Never let Milo Minderbinder talk. Or ex-PFC Wintergreen. Milo was able to make a profit by selling black market foodstuffs to himself. And rightfully bragged about it.

After all, it is so staggeringly improbable that such a thing would have been created by chance that it proves there is a creator.

Fittingly, the man gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing/crosswalk.
</li><li> Legal precedent was established when the Guide was sued by the families of hitchhikers who had taken the entry on the planet Traal literally. (It said "The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal often makes a very good meal <em>for</em> visiting tourists" rather than "The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal often makes a very good meal <em>of</em> visiting tourists") The Guide's lawyers summoned a poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth and truth beauty, and therefore blamed life for failing to be either beautiful or true.

The mother is so gullible that she begins to think she <em>is</em> a rock, but Erasmus "saves" her by pointing out that rocks can't talk, but she can, so she's not a rock after all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Due to this play</a>, the concept of insane troll logic is called <em>Erasmus-Montanus logic</em> in Denmark.

Kate begs their servant Grumio to give her food. Grumio pretends to use this so that he can follow Petruchio's orders.
<ul><li> First he offers to get Kate some calf's foot. When she agrees he rescinds the offer, saying that calf's foot would make her bad-tempered.
</li><li> Then he offers her tripe but takes that offer back for the same reason.
</li><li> The real kicker is the beef and mustard. When he offers this to Kate, she agrees. Then he says no because the mustard is too hot. She says she'll have the beef without the mustard, then. He says no, the beef goes with the mustard. She says she's willing to eat one or the other or both or anything else. So Grumio comes up with the perfect solution: mustard without the beef!
</li></ul></li><li> In Caryl Churchill's version of <em>A Dream Play,</em> there is a scene with a teacher in school arguing logic with a student of his. The teacher is asked what time is, to which he replies that since time flies, logically, time is something that flies while he's speaking. One of the other schoolboys starts to fly, claiming that by that logic, he is time. The teacher agrees, confirming that he is in fact time. But the first student says that that's impossible, and because logic failed in that case, we can therefore logically prove that logic is wrong.
</li><li> Touchstone, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AsYouLikeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AsYouLikeIt">As You Like It</a></em>, explains that Corin's going to Hell because he never went to court:

For example, he attempts to prove that Olivia is a fool so that the people asked to "take away the fool" will remove her instead of him:
<div class="indent"><strong>Feste:</strong> Good madonna, why mournest thou? <br/><strong>Olivia:</strong> Good fool, for my brother's death. <br/><strong>Feste:</strong> I think his soul is in Hell, madonna. <br/><strong>Olivia:</strong> I know his soul is in Heaven, fool. <br/><strong>Feste:</strong> The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
</div><ul><li> Feste also gives a lengthy, confusing speech when Olivia accuses him of growing dishonest:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Olivia</strong>: Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest. <br/><strong>Feste</strong>: Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool no longer dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, then he is no longer dishonest: if he cannot, let the botcher mend him: anything that's mended is but patched: virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that amends is but patched with virtue: if that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.  The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, one of the witnesses devolves into this frequently, notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">why he steals large panties (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>)</span>, and if you can actually keep up with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrollingText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrollingText">Scrolling Text</a>, he somehow manages to take the leap from discussing someone being shot "square in the forehead" to "krypton particles are rare" among other things.
</li><li> Phoenix will often break into this trope whenever the player answers a question wrong. Take this example from the DLC case of the fifth game:
<div class="indent"><strong>Judge:</strong> And on what grounds do you base your assertion that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the singing trick</span> was faked? <br/><strong>Phoenix:</strong> Take That! <br/><strong>Judge:</strong> That item proves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the singing trick</span> was faked? <br/><strong>Phoenix:</strong> No, Your Honor. This piece of evidence will not prove that. In other words... this piece of evidence is... a fake-out! And if this evidence is a fake-out, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the singing trick</span> was a fake-out as well! <br/><strong>Athena:</strong> Boss, I don't think that makes any sense... <br/><strong>Phoenix:</strong> Momentum is key at times like these. <br/><strong>Judge:</strong> I can hear every word you're saying, Mr. Wright!
</div></li><li> Edgeworth himself does this if you present wrong evidence in at a few parts in <em>Investigations 2</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Edgeworth:</strong> Objection! Do you not see a problem with your statement just now?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Courtney:</strong> I'm afraid I see no such problem.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Edgeworth:</strong> Exactly. So if you fail to see the problem, then that must mean you fail to see the problem with accepting your logic! You're admitting that you can't comprehend your own logic?!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Courtney:</strong> The only thing I fail to see here, is your point.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Edgeworth:</strong> Nggh...! (Curses...! I guess I should have known that wouldn't work...)
</div></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt Engarde</span> also proclaims that he never killed anyone, despite hiring an assassin to commit the case's murder for him, making him indirectly responsible. Either due to using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> or his own warped belief in his own innocence, he actually manages to fool Phoenix's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieDetector">Magatama</a> with this.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Turnabout Time Traveler</a>, when Edgeworth protests that some scattered flower petals are hardly "meaningful" evidence, the Judge disagrees...because they're his wife's favorite flowers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">their relationship</a> is VERY meaningful, so the petals must be, too. Phoenix is actually able to get a fair number of bluffs through by playing on this angle; since the trial centers around a wedding and Edgeworth is quite vocal about his desire to remain single, the Judge will usually agree with Phoenix due to Edgeworth 'not understanding romance'.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> this is what Battler's strategy degenerates into when he's desperately grasping at straws, no matter how ridiculous, as a viable theory (as long as magic isn't involved of course); from "spike-launching devices" to "small bombs". Beatrice lets the more amusing ones pass, at least for the time. Dlanor uses her laws to cut them down abruptly and mercilessly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em>:

Perhaps the biggest example is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kirigiri</span> shows up after having believed to have been killed, and Hagakure refuses to believe that she isn't a ghost. The first part of the trial then consists of Naegi having to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kirigiri</span> really is alive. <em>While the person in question is standing right in front of them.</em>
<div class="indent"><strong>Hagakure:</strong> Wrong! That's clearly a ghost, right!? <br/><strong>Asahina:</strong> She has legs, though. <br/><strong>Hagakura:</strong> Um...that's probably because...it's the new ghost model they've been developing recently! <br/><strong>Togami:</strong> I thought there were limits to being an idiot.
</div></li><li> Monokuma is a less hilarious example. He traps the cast in a building, tells them that the only way out is to kill someone and get away with it, and then psychologically and emotionally tortures and blackmails them to make them desperate to get out enough to kill. Whenever anybody calls him on it, though, he claims that the students killing each other is entirely on them and it isn't his fault. But his worst use of Insane Troll Logic is unquestionably when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he outright decides to plant a fake suicide note on the scene of a crime and when this is found out, he tries to claim that this act <em>wasn't</em> the same thing as planting false evidence or attempting to mislead anyone trying to find the killer. It turns out that particular instance <em>was</em> indeed a suicide, but <em>not</em> for the reasons Monokuma's fake note implied.</span>

<ul><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Red Mage's</a> plans run on this very logic. When stranded on an island, Thief quite accurately states that Red Mage's plan to get off the island would likely involve blowing up the island with them on it with the justification that they're no longer on the island anymore. While Red Mage's actual plan was much less dangerous, it did involve massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biology</a> for the Chocobos and a willingness to exploit his Mime ability beyond its actual usefulness.
</li><li> This quote of Red Mage's sums it up quite well.
<div class="indent"><strong>RM:</strong> In the arena of logic, I fight unarmed!
</div></li><li> Everyone in the comic is either a liar, a cheat, or utterly stupid, if not all three, so conversations tend toward this. For example; <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2008/01/15/episode-942-cross-eyed-traffic/">In this comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Red Mage explains how his plan to shoot down a visible sky castle, then repair it, in order to fly high enough to find the invisible sky castle "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2008/01/15/episode-942-cross-eyed-traffic/">makes too little sense to fail<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>."
<div class="indent"><strong>Black Mage:</strong> Okay, Red Mage, enlighten us. How can a plan that makes <em>no sense</em> work? <br/><strong>Red Mage:</strong> One simple reason: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">It makes too little sense to fail</a>. <br/><strong>BM:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">What</a>. <br/><strong>RM:</strong> Most plans are <em>critically</em> flawed by their own logic. A failure at any step will ruin everything after it. That's just basic cause and effect. It's easy for a good plan to fall apart. Therefore, a plan that has <em>no attachment</em> to logic cannot be stopped. The success or failure of any step will have no effect on the macro level. <br/><strong>BM:</strong> That's so stupid I can't even see straight anymore. <br/><strong>RM:</strong> Now imagine what'll happen when physics tries to figure it out! <br/><strong>BM:</strong> Seriously, this hurts.
</div></li><li> Black Mage isn't immune to this himself, either. Among other things, he justifies his penchant for extreme short-term planning on the grounds that since it's always now there is no long term and therefore he can't be screwed by it (shortly after being screwed by it), and his explanation for why he tore off the wings of a fairy in order to stick them on a baby's back and make a fake fairy managed to confuse even Red Mage.
<div class="indent"><strong>Black Mage:</strong> <em>[on a corpse]</em> It's not what it looks like? <br/><strong>Guard 1:</strong> Looks like a man killed either by a flurry of stab wounds or from having his face peeled off. <br/><strong>Black Mage:</strong> Right! So it can't be that, as I explained just now. <br/><strong>Guard 2:</strong> I think he has a point. <br/><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Guard 1:</a></strong> You think he has a point? His point is that the corpse can't be a corpse <em>because</em> it's a corpse. That's no point at all!
</div></li><li> Black Mage explains his loyalty to Chaos:
<div class="indent"><strong>BM:</strong> Way I see it, <em>yes</em>, Chaos is the embodiment of all suffering and destruction. But he's also the wildcard of natural forces. Chaos! Dude gave us 24 hours for basically no reason! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid">Who knows what he'll do next?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Okay, sure, he'll destroy the world.</a> But maybe he'll turn it into cake. Or fire. But I figure there's more kinds of cake than fire, so the odds are <em>actually</em> in my favour. <br/><strong>RM:</strong> Even I know that's a dumb plan. A dumb, <em>dumb</em> plan.

</li><li> Miko uses troll logic from time to time, as lampshaded by Roy:

</div></li><li> There are also Nathan's claims about his own sexuality, denying that he's at all gay despite starting each day out by having anal sex with one of his male subordinates.

Oddly, it actually makes perfect sense. You see, Tedd looks <em>very</em> androgynous and would quite like to look more manly. But he keeps long hair anyway. If he cut his hair, he would look very slightly more manly but it would be obvious that the thing that makes him look so feminine is his actual face itself. If he keeps his hair in a really girly long hairstyle, then everyone at school with him assumes that he would look manly if not for his hair.
<ul><li> Much later on, Tedd realizes that he's actually genderfluid. This provides an alternative (and less illogical) reason for maintaining long hair; he sometimes enjoys looking girly even when he's not using one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> devices to turn himself female.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfZenith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalesOfZenith">Tales Of Zenith</a></em>, Tam O'Shanter says that it's JFK's fault the Oklahoma City Courthouse was bombed. "JFK appointed his brother Attorney General. This got Congress so mad they passed a law that the president can't appoint any relatives to a cabinet position. This meant that Bill Clinton couldn't appoint his wife Attorney General, so when Waco happened, instead of Hillary talking it out with David Koresh, Janet Reno allowed the FBI to use tanks and tear gas, and people couldn't get out and died. As a result, Timothy McVeigh saw what happened and decided to blow up the Oklahoma City Courthouse. That's why it's JFK's fault, if he hadn't appointed his brother Attorney General, Hillary would have been able to be appointed, and she's too politically savvy to have made the mistake Janet Reno did."
