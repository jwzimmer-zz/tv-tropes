He says he is being very nice to her and wants to help her as a friend but is just saying this to get into her pants and believes he has a right to her. He cannot fathom why she is not attracted to him. When she refuses him he reveals to the townsfolk that she was bitten by a vampire, in the hopes that they will ostracize her. He says it is to protect the town but Dan (brother of Doris) says the real reason he told everyone is due to him being spiteful over Doris rejecting him.

So when Guts desires to leave Griffith's shadow, he cannot take it, dueling Guts and losing, sending Griffith down a spiraling path. Griffith, immediately after Guts' departure, goes and sleeps with the princess of Midland, desperate to fill the void in his life and thinking of nothing but Guts during sex.

<ul><li> Mutsuki adopts the "force your love in a twisted fashion on your special someone" aspect from Torso and develops these feelings for Sasaki/Kaneki especially after getting jealous when seeing him interact with Touka. He thinks because he is a liar to protect himself and Kaneki/Sasaki is a liar to protect others that they are kindred spirits. Then he mentions thats why he and not Touka should be with Kaneki.

When she realizes that, in real life, this isn't an instant romance button, she has a very bad freak out. (All the more so because the entire time, she's only been able to control her envy of her rival Sena's various merits by constantly telling herself that none of it matters, because she is the childhood friend and thus no amount of beauty, talent, wealth or even genuine love on Sena's part would win her Kodaka. When she discovers that he's actually known and was friends with Sena since long before he ever knew her, she falls into utter despair once again.)

<ul><li> This is Nobuyuki Sugou's attitude towards Asuna throughout the Fairy Dance arc.

After giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a>, he seems annoyed when Shino tells him that she's too busy focusing on the Bullet of Bullets tournament to answer him at the moment. This reaches a head by the end of the arc; Kyouji breaks into Shino's apartment, demands to know what she thinks of him, and claims that she promised to be his as he tries to rape her.

Keep in mind that this means that he sees the princess of Avalon (the girl whose hand in marriage would equal rulership over the entire continent) as his personal slave rather than a meal ticket to ultimate political power. Which is disturbing but also amazing (even for a rich kid).

He becomes insanely jealous of Shigeru when he gets together with Maya, despite her having already rejected Sakurakouji.

In the original <em>Fortune Lover</em>, Katarina played this straight, using the scar as an excuse to keep Gerald on the engagement to her even though it faded after a few years, while Gerald isn't happy with the situation. In the current timeline with reincarnated Katarina, however, Gerald eventually falls in love with her. She, on the other hand, only agreed to get married because she wasn't paying attention <em>twice</em> and now can't call it off without his consent, with <em>Gerald</em> using the scar as an excuse to keep the engagement on, even, again, as it faded in a few years. In the present, he behaves like she belongs to him as his fiancee, but it's actually pretty obvious that he's just using it as a crutch against his rivals and knows how flimsy the ground he stands on is.

One episode has a stalker chain where Matoi is stalking Nozomu, followed by a boy she stalked before, a lady who loves the guy stalking Matoi, and a cleaner that stalks a lady saying he washes her underwear for her. They all are acting in this creepy manner towards the ones they are partial towards because they feel it is their right and they are attracted to someone who does not have feelings for them and play hard to get (in their mind anyway).

This is made even creepier by the fact that Filo is a small child, leading to Naofumi accusing him of being a pedophile.
</li><li> Tatewaki Kuno from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> believes that his status as heir to the wealthy and aristocratic Kuno clan justifies his pursuit of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">distinctly disinterested</a> Akane and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">(female)</a> Ranma, assuming he doesn't claim that they're the ones into <em>him</em>.

Ironically, after suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a>, he actually gets <em>worse</em> about this trait; remembering only that he wants the female Ranma, he begins pursuing her much more forcibly, even attempting to outright rape her before being forcibly restored to normal with a convenient blow to the head.
<ul><li> Mousse declares frequently that he "deserves" Shampoo because they are former childhood friends from the same tribe, and his entire rivalry with Ranma is due to Ranma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Accidental Marriage</a> to Shampoo. Never mind that Shampoo bluntly tells him that she doesn't love Mousse and <em>does</em> love Ranma, or that Shampoo is more than willing to beat him senseless or exploit him for slave labor because of the disdain his attitude invokes in her.

However, when Joichiro's wife died, he had to go back to Japan to raise his son, and couldn't visit Asahi as much as before. This caused Asahi to develop a resentment for Soma, thinking that he "stole" Joichiro from him (and it's even worse in the anime, where Joichiro actually asks Asahi directly if he'd like to come along to Japan, but Asahi refuses, the implication being that he doesn't want to share his father figure with anyone else).

The poor woman kills him in self-defense, which starts a plotline about the main characters having to hide his corpse because the traditional feudalist society they live in (and even some of the older male "good" characters) agrees that she should just have endured it. This whole incident is used by the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">to get across the message</a> to the presumably largely young and male audience that power inequality and the attitude reflected in this trope (and general sociopathy) is the reason for rape, not anything the woman did or anything inherent in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt">male gender</a> or impaired judgement due to intoxication.

Eventually, as the more time passes, she forgets her true identity (that being of the last unicorn in the world), and Lír is enthusiastic to come in and start writing her own past for her; eventually molding her into the perfect demure doll who will love him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of the story, once she's turned back into a unicorn and all the unicorns in the world are free, he's very bitter at the fact that she didn't give him any parting words compared to her companions, and is ready to start chasing after her in a way very similar to his villainous father, King Haggard.</span>

Her reactions indicate that it was naivete about his intentions rather than an attempt to use him, but he still forces himself on her a bit later.

Later, when she's kidnapped by a local warlord and held for ransom, Arthur defies his father and rushes out to rescue her, telling Merlin all the way there that he and Gwen can't ever be a couple and it's useless to dwell on what can never be. Thing is, he's completely unaware that Lancelot is currently staging his own rescue attempt, and when it becomes obvious that Gwen rather fancies his competition, he immediately gets huffy and tries to save face by saying that he only turned up because Morgana begged him to. So despite what he told Gwen, he actually did expect her to return his feelings and gets sulky when she takes his words to heart and searches for love elsewhere.

</li><li> We Hunted the Mammoth dredges these up <em>a lot</em>, and site runner David Futrelle <em>loathes</em> this attitude. Many of his subjects get this way over women who are overweight or have piercings and tattoos, with at least one anti-feminist outright stating that women only have "stewardship" over their own bodies, as opposed to having ownership.

A guy she called "Gary" told Madame's friends that she had "cruelly friend-zoned" him in order to guilt her into dating him. Even though, in reality, she didn't date him because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">constantly texted her about wanting to hang out despite her refusals</a>, acted creepily around her when she caved in and hung out with him (including making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification">"joke"</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">how hot her breasts looked</a>), breaking up with his more-loving girlfriend, and Madame's friend, Julie, because he thought Madame was hotter and telling Julie to not talk to Madame anymore because he said it would damage his nonexistent relationship with her.
