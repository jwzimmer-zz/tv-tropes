<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Shuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Shuffle">SHUFFLE!</a></em> has a version of this. Ama was/is a volunteer test subject used in an incredibly high risk magical experiment. (She volunteered because she felt she had no reason to live.) It failed, and she was, incidentally, thrown into the human world, where she fell in love, had a child, happy ending etc. Almost 2 decades later, the Gods (and overseers of the experiment) happen to walk past her, and after staring at her for a while, continue walking, talking loudly enough for her to hear:
<div class="indent"><strong>Forbesii:</strong> Someone you know, Eustoma? <br/><strong>Eustoma:</strong> No, just thinking she looked like someone I knew who passed away. <br/><strong>Forbesii:</strong> What a coincidence, I was thinking the same. <br/><strong>Eustoma:</strong> If she <em>were</em> alive, I would want to apologize at least once. <br/><strong>Forbesii:</strong> Yeah, I feel terrible about what happened to her.

Kiba points out to Issei that even an example demarcation counts, and he and Koneko should just go with him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The person Rias was decieving here was Issei, to maximize his willpower when that was the only thing he had going for him.

<ul><li> The comic book series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> had an example of this combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingOutForAQuickCupOfCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingOutForAQuickCupOfCoffee">Stepping Out for a Quick Cup of Coffee</a>.

They take the hint.
</li><li> In a '70s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> arc, Reed Richards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu">bluffed Galactus into leaving the Earth alone</a> with a fake Ultimate Nullifier. After Galactus left, the Watcher, who was bound by his code of ethics to never interfere with other living beings, revealed that he had telepathically entered Reed's mind to prevent Galactus from sensing his plan, claiming he was simply observing the event from Reed's point of view. As he left, he added "Can one help it if one's mere presence brings about a more desired outcome? Can one?"
<ul><li> This tends to be Uatu the Watcher's shtick. Despite not allowed to interfere into events of the Marvelverse, he finds ways of loopholing his way to help. The heroes have gotten to the point where Uatu can deliver warnings merely by turning visible — everybody knows that he watches when something truly dangerous or important is happening, so the mere knowledge that he's watching and he wants them to know he's watching is enough.

Partially through the story, Spidey found them and told them he believed the plans given were a ruse to distract them; however, Cap wasn't able to defy orders to check on that. He did, however tell Spidey where the mook's cell was, saying "Maybe I'll <em>re-question</em> him later". Then he and Silver left him alone. (In <em>the Pentagon</em>, no less.) Spidey didn't know whether that was Cap's way of making an informal suggestion or not, but he took the opportunity, and it paid off.

So I'm not going to tell you. Because that would be wrong."
</li><li> Professor Colbert in <em>An American Geek In Halkegania</em> is required to be professional and impartial towards the other teachers at all times, even when he's previously disproved said teacher's claims of Air being superior by soundly defeating him: "It does not do, of course, to observe that a fellow professor is a bore, a windbag, or an insufferable ass, especially in front of students, so I shall decline to comment."

(This despite the fact that Ichiro's contract was not the most expensive in the sport either in terms of yearly salary or lump sum; that Ichiro was by far the most talented, popular, and marketable player on Seattle's squad; and that Ichiro would have almost certainly received even more had he hit the open market with more bidders to drive up his price.)

Normally, one is not supposed to give an in-depth eulogy if the funeral service occurs during or shortly after a major holiday, since the joyous nature of the holiday trumps the sorrowful nature of the mourning service. (A short eulogy focused on remembering the deceased for his/her virtues is acceptable, but one should avoid grieving too much because otherwise one might begin to associate the holiday with the person's death.) A common way around this is for a mourner to say something like, "But if I <em>could</em> give a full eulogy, here's what I would say..." and then proceed to give the full eulogy.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sanford Johnson:</strong> <em>[holding up a rolled up sock]</em> I start out with this sock and I'm going to pinch a little air out of the tip of the sock, because I want to make sure there's room for my toes, when I'm engaging in shoe activity. I bring the sock down to the tip of my foot... You want to take your sock and roll it all the way down to the end of your foot, all the way down to the end of your foot, and then you can put it inside your shoe.
</div><ul><li> In his expose on warehouses, when talking about XPO Logistics' incident in October of 2017 involving a worker who died due to heat stroke, he brings up that despite coworkers posting about it on Facebook, XPO denied the claim with their own internal investigation, which was delivered verbally, leading John to give us this.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>John Oliver</strong>: It's really up to you. The lawyers say 'It's up to you'. I asked the lawyers 'Can it be up to me?' and they said 'No,' and I said 'Cause if it was, I'd choose the Facebook one,' and they said 'Well you definitely can't say that,' so I'm not going to.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese">John Cleese</a>'s eulogy at the 1990 memorial service of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamChapman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamChapman">Graham Chapman</a> included this gem:
<div class="indent"><strong>John Cleese:</strong> I could hear him whispering in my ear last night as I was writing this: "Alright, Cleese, you're very proud of being the first person to ever say 'shit' on television. If this service is really for me, just for starters, I want you to be the first person ever at a British memorial service to say 'fuck'!" You see, the trouble is, I can't. If he were here with me now I would probably have the courage, because he always emboldened me. But the truth is, I lack his balls, his splendid defiance. And so I'll have to content myself instead with saying "Betty Mardsen..."
</div></li><li> In one quite amazing moment of the 2016 presidential election, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/692312112115380224?lang=en">tweeted the following statement about reporter Megyn Kelly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent">I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be respectful. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
</div></li><li> Some organizations such as libraries and Internet service providers post <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">"warrant canary"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> statements declaring that they have not been served with any secret government orders to hand over customer data. Removing the statement invites the obvious conclusion while not technically violating the gag order.
</li><li> In the 2016 US election, a piece in The Yale Record helpfully explained that it would not endorse a candidate on account of being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, then went into glowing detail on a candidate it was emphatically <em>not</em> endorsing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> made this comment during negotiations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">Good Friday Agreement</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>"A day like today is not a day for soundbites, we can leave those at home, but I feel the hand of history upon our shoulder with respect to this, I really do."</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> enraged North Korea after tweeting:
<div class="indent">Why would Kim Jong-Un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat"?
</div></li><li> When it comes to TV shows produced on networks like HBO, Netflix and AMC, actors are absolutely sworn to secrecy when it comes to gigantic projects with lots of NDA and red tape. However, some actors on projects with these kinds of tight NDAs occasionally invoke this trope to let slip something without technically violating their secrecy clauses.
<ul><li> Here's an example: during production of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>, it was a no-brainer that Foggy Nelson's girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Marci Stahl</a> would be returning, since Foggy had ended the second season working with her at Jeri Hogarth's law firm. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieCox">Charlie Cox</a> (Matt Murdock), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahAnnWoll">Deborah Ann Woll</a> (Karen Page), Elden Henson (Foggy) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VincentDOnofrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VincentDOnofrio">Vincent D'Onofrio</a> (Wilson Fisk) were confirmed right before filming began, the closest Marci's actress Amy Rutberg could get in interviews to saying she was playing Marci in season 3 without actually saying it was to say things like, "<a class="urllink" href="https://vulkanmagazine.com/content/amy-rutberg/">I have a super secret project Ive been working on since November that will be out later this year<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>," knowing that someone aware of Marvel's reputation for secrecy, and the fact that <em>Daredevil</em> season 3 had begun filming in mid-November 2017, would read between her words.
</li></ul></li><li> A slightly serious version was uttered by the defense counsel to one of the members of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekingegade_Gang">Blekinge Street Gang<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during a brief break in the trial, when the massive arms cache the gang had hidden was being discussed. He told a police officer who was in charge of the investigation and was present in court, that a pair of surf boards found along with the arms cache were fragile and should be handled with care. Taking the hint, the police officer had the Danish Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team carefully remove said surf boards and x-ray them, at which point the RPG warheads hidden inside were discovered.
