<div class="indent">— <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes">Holes</a></em>
</div></div><p>A common plot for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>: A character, typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">a friend or acquaintance</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, is revealed to be illiterate by some odd quirk of behavior. This is typically a shameful secret to them; the episode typically ends with their beginning to study, and the issue is never mentioned again.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This plot lends itself to mysteries because of the suspicious behavior used to cover-up illiteracy and the opportunity for a character to be cleared of crime because the crime depended upon being literate.
</p><p>This trope has started to invite parody, and is probably on its way to becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a> in relatively wealthy societies due to the vast majority of the people within possessing functional literacy. If it's still played straight, the character will probably be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LIsForDyslexia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LIsForDyslexia">dyslexic</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> being that this has nothing to do with being uneducated and should not be a source of shame. Characters are also occasionally revealed to be unable to read English (or whatever is the dominant language where they are living) due to being recent immigrants.
</p><p>Stories set in or around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution">Industrial Revolution</a> (or similar time periods where universal education is a recent invention) may have the character in question quit school at a young age in order to support his family, or due to some other bit of the harshness of life. These <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDropout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDropout">Tragic Dropouts</a> simply do not have the time to learn how to read, having never had the security of life to allow for an education. By the time they do become secure enough in their livelihood to take the time, they are simply too ashamed to admit it and usually get by with only a very basic literacy, or (if they're old enough) claiming that their eyes aren't what they used to be. Stories set in an era prior to that (or where public education doesn't exist) may have illiteracy as the norm (as is realistic).

<ul><li> Played for laughs in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> where Mugen is revealed to be illiterate because of his habit of always ordering the same thing as his companions Fuu and Jin. A rather enthusiastic teacher acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> and teaches him to read, and at the end of the episode, Mugen uses his newly acquired skills as a Graffiti artist as well as tagging his name on his companions' clothing... and possessions... and pet. Incidentally, using this trope is a good example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a> of the series: Mugen is a nineteen-year-old from Ryukyu who has been a criminal his entire life; realistically Fuu and Jin should have been more surprised if he <em>could</em> read.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>. It is revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a> Sapphire is barely literate when she has to pass a written test for the chance to battle Roxanne, and of course, said Gym Leader mocked her and lectured her on the importance of reading. Sapphire's illiteracy can easily be attributed to her lifestyle... but also due to her lifestyle, she's well versed in Pokemon ecology and biology, meaning that once she had someone read the questions for her, she ended up the first person ever to score a perfect mark on Roxanne's test.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, Asuka portrays the recent immigrant version. She's been failing tests at school, but when Shinji is having issues with a math problem and reads it out loud, she solves it easily in her head. When he expresses his shock that she's not getting better grades, she reveals that it is because she can't read the kanji in the tests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em>: Minami Shimada <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">is Japanese but lived in Germany until recently</a>, so her reading and writing comprehension of kanji is poor, to the point that she is landed in Class F with the other protagonists. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a> in the second season shows, on her first day at Fumizuki Academy, she even accidentally wrote her name wrong.
</li><li> In a flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Natsu says his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> Igneel taught him how to read, but it turned out he only learned the words that have to do with food. Erza gives him a strict lesson that teaches him the other words in about three days. In the present, Natsu still has a little difficulty and reads very slowly, often having to sound the words out.
</li><li> Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople">Japan</a> assumed as much about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">Italy</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Germany</strong>: Oh, this is a note from Italy. <br/><strong>Japan</strong>: (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a></em>) Italy is literate?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Fate/Apocrypha</a></em>, Jeanne d'Arc never learned to read since she was a farmer's daughter turned warrior. However, since the Holy Grail provides the Servants with basic knowledge of the modern world, it doesn't hinder her that much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>: A large number of the boys in CGS/Tekkadan, including the protagonist Mikazuki, fit in here due to never having had a formal education. When Kudelia offers to teach Mika early in the series, he and a number of other boys eagerly start studying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe">Ashita no Joe</a></em>, Joe Yabuki is a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> who never went to school and is barely literate. This bites him <em>hard</em> in the ass when he wants to get a boxing license and it's time for the written exams...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a>: Hokkaido Arc</em>, two of Kenshin and Kaoru's new protegés (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Ashitaro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFashionista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFashionista">Asahi</a>) can barely read. This brings them <em>BIG</em> trouble later: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Asahi thought that gathering a certain quantity of money would be enough to purchase her freedom, but the real price was much higher and her abusive owner not only didn't disuade her, but wanted to sell her off to a far worse guy. When Ashitaro tried to defend her, he couldn't read the written contracts either and that led to a <em>massive</em> fight that Kenshin had to break up.</span> Since the third protegé (Alan) is literate, Ashitaro asks him to teach Asahi how to do it, and Alan happily accepts on the condition that Ashitaro should learn too.
</li><li> Holo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em>. Sure, she once tried to learn, but it got annoying, so she gave up on it.
</li><li> Yuuri from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsLastTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsLastTour">Girls' Last Tour</a></em> never learnt how to read even phonetic Japanese, whereas Chito can both read and write it, but can't read kanji. Living in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalypse</a> makes this rather excusable.
</li><li> Inosuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em> admits that he never learned how to read or write. This is because he grew up in the mountains by himself after his mother was killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the demon Doma</span> and he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">raised by a wild boar</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl (2000)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cassandra Cain, Batgirl II, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">raised</a> to be the perfect assassin by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">her father</a>, who never even spoke in front of her, so she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">didn't know how to speak</a>, much less to read. When she was taken in by the Batfamily, she spent her life as a crime-fighter. It was consistently depicted as a set-back, and eventually caused the rift between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusCripple">Oracle</a> and her, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Oracle</a> called her "stupid" in the middle of a battle while Cassie was desperately trying to shut down a killer robot, hurting Cass deeply.
<div class="indent"><strong>Oracle</strong>: You're kidding — you still don't even know the damn <em>alphabet</em>?! All those hours you spend practicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu">martial arts</a> and you can't spare the time to learn your #$%@ <em>ABC</em>'s?! For God's sake, Cassie — how stupid can you be?!
</div></li><li> Cassandra Cain has it worse than most. The reason her dad never spoke to her is to encourage the language centers of her brain to "read" body language. As such, besides the usual troubles of learning to read (and speak) later in life, her brain effectively developed in such a way that her ability to learn speech was almost completely demolished. Makes this a pretty big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> moment for Oracle, as she's effectively not only hurt by being reminded of her embarrassing handicap, it ignored the fact that the only reason she is that way is because of severe emotional abuse (her father would randomly attack her as part of her training) for the first several years of her life, culminating in her killing a man while knowing exactly how horrified he is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">At age eight.</a> That the only thing wrong with her brain is her difficulty with language is a sign of nothing short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Meggan from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em> was illiterate since her inhuman appearance kept her from going to school as a child. During the course of the series, several members of the team offered to help tutor her, and near the end, she finishes her lessons and has an average adult reading level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em>: Also X-related, Catseye from the Hellions was abandoned at birth since her mutation manifested early, and she spent much of her life thinking she was a cat who transformed into a human rather than vice-versa. Once discovered by Emma Frost, she went from complete illiteracy to grade school-level reading within a year, showing a hidden intelligence.
</li><li> The 100th issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrooTheWanderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrooTheWanderer">Groo the Wanderer</a></em> (Marvel run) is about Groo learning to read.

This being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, the books start to "leak", he gains the information without having understood the words that he memorized.

Eunice, the family's maid, is obsessed with keeping her illiteracy a secret from everyone throughout the story, and the family's learning of it leads her to kill them all.

Eragon's cousin Roran, having grown up in the same house, also never learned to read. He indicates a desire to try and learn since his inability to do so is holding him back from advancing in the Varden's ranks, but it isn't brought up much afterwards.

Before then, Zsadist made no effort to change his illiterate state, though there were hints it <em>did</em> bother him, since it not only inconvenienced him but also forced him to rely on others - mainly his twin, Phury - to accomplish simple tasks.

</li><li> Although there are newspapers and bookstores around, a point is made that illiteracy among lower-class people is common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, since mothers make more money if their daughters work alongside them than if they're off in schools. Men are almost never taught to read. Cullen Moorland admits that his cousin tried to teach him, but he claims she was a poor teacher, and anyway it's not like his wives, once he's married, will let him read. The Whistlers, seriously thinking about courting him, feel differently.

Roadbuster passes the time by reading to him, having to learn to do so, because he's spent millions of years fighting. He continuously struggles and eventually reads almost all 331 cataloging their adventures to him, twice, the second time trying to get the more complex words right. He doesn't read 113, because they both know it's a lie, but he does reveal some circumstances that Springer never knew.

At the climax, the two are stuck in a hole surrounded by poisonous lizards and with the treasure the warden had been searching for. Zero suddenly asks Stanley if his full name is spelled the same forwards and backwards, and Stanley confirms it is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zero asked because he noticed the name "Stanley Yelnats" on the treasure chest—proving that it originally belonged to Stanley's great-grandfather.</span>

Raymond confesses he can't spell it either, and they share a laugh.
</li><li> A recurring theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s works:
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea">Earthsea</a> Cycle</em>, the Kargs as a people view reading and writing as "black arts" and avoid them at all costs, though ironically they are excellent at mathematics. When Ged rescues Tenar from the Tombs of Atuan and brings her with him to his land, she eventually learns to how speak his language, and then to read and write in it.
</li><li> The Alds from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnalsOfTheWesternShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnalsOfTheWesternShore">Annals of the Western Shore</a></em> view reading and books as evil.
</li><li> In <em>Always Coming Home</em>, the Dayao people consider reading sacred, since they associate it with the act of Creation. As such, any commoner attempting to read or write is punished by either an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">An Arm and a Leg</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>: Part of the Vorin religion's strict gender roles mean that men are not allowed to read. The only exception is if they become ardents (sort of priest-slaves), who legally have no gender and are supposed to learn all skills so they can provide aid to both men and women. It's not uncommon for Vorin men who have an interest in math or scholarship to join the ardentia. Furthermore, there are stylized glyphs which are practically a language in their own right, but since they are designed to be recognizable even by someone who was never seen them before, everyone insists it's not the same, and men are allowed to read them. Most men still don't learn them, though. Late in the second book, <em>Words of Radiance</em>, it's discovered that Lord Amaram managed to find a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> around this by arranging glyphs into a complex series of ideas, creating what was essentially a full language that at first looks like gibberish to those who are used to just seeing glyphs by themselves.
</li><li> In <em>Unofficial History</em> by Sir William Slim, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrounger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrounger">The Scrounger</a> of Slim's unit is caught red-handed stealing a box of supplies.

Turns out the box was full of sugar, which the soldiers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">get anyway in their rations</a>, so what reason would he have to steal a box of it? He only reveals afterward to Slim that because he can't read, he'd just stolen the wrong box.
</li><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EvaLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EvaLuna">Eva Luna</a></em> always wanted to learn how to read and write, so she could properly use her talent as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller">The Storyteller</a>. Her agitated life didn't give her the chance until she was in her mid-teens at least, and she was absolutely <em>euphoric</em> as she put her ideas and plots into written words.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em>, shortly after taking control of the farm, the pigs reveal that they can already read and write, so they teach it to the other animals. The results are... rather zigzagged. The dogs can read as well as the pigs but aren't interested in reading anything other than The Seven Commandments of Animalism. Benjamin the donkey can read probably better than the pigs but chooses not to read. Muriel the goat can read from newspapers. Clover has learned all of the alphabet but can't put the letters together. Poor Boxer can't get beyond A, B, C, and D, and Mollie won't spell anything other than her own name. All the others (sheep, chickens, ducks, and geese) are pretty much book-dumb.
</li><li> Inverted in a novel about the building of Hoover Dam (might have been <em>Big Red</em> by John Haase, but it's been a while since I read it).

Subverts the single episode aspect in that Jordan doesn't start his tutoring right away (plus he's already been held back at least a year), and the fact that it pervades his character throughout the rest of the series. And that he can write music.
</li><li> One <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KateAndAllie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KateAndAllie">Kate And Allie</a></em> saw Kate trying to teach the building's handyman to read. When he rebels at children's books, she presents him with an adult romance novel, which he is instantly able to read.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>: At least two instances:
<ul><li> Eddie wants to enroll in a college where athletics is valued over academics, and plans to forsake his studies for a NBA-worthy basketball career. That is, until he meets a supermarket stockboy/bagboy who was a former college standout ... until suffering a career-ending injury, after which his illiteracy is exposed.
</li><li> 3J, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">Cousin Oliver</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>, was introduced in an episode where Urkel is his Big Brother (an episode paying homage to the organization).
</li></ul></li><li> One of Wesley's new friends on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere">Mr. Belvedere</a></em> pays him to write his book reports, finally admitting that he never learned to read because his family moved around a lot. Wesley starts teaching him, but he starts going to remedial classes by the end of the episode.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em> which spoofed cheap attempts to win an Emmy, Drew had to single-handedly discover a cure for Kate's terminal illness. The only problem is, he never learned to read.
</li><li> Eugene from the Korean drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrSunshineKDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrSunshineKDrama">Mr. Sunshine</a></em> lived in Korea until he was nine and escaped to America from his slave owner with the help of a missionary. Since he was the child of slaves, he never leaned to read in Korean. In the US, he was able to learn to read and write English well enough to get a university education at the Naval Academy. When he gets stationed in his hometown as a Marine officer, he has to learn to read his native tongue.
</li><li> Used several times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em> due to its being set in the 19th century (and to champion reading programs, because of continued illiteracy):
<ul><li> In an early first-season episode, Laura was ashamed at how poorly she could write and pretended to recite a poem she'd written about her Ma, but her written words didn't match what she said. (This was also in part because Nellie Olesen, whom she had just met, had cruelly mocked her when it was apparent to her she couldn't read or write.) When Caroline found out, she turned this into a heartwarming moment between mother and daughter.
</li><li> Another first-season episode sees Caroline take a substitute teaching job at the school, and the children cruelly mock a teenager when he cannot intelligently answer the questions or read what was on the blackboard. Caroline calls off school for several days while she privately tutors the lad.
</li><li> Mr. Edwards gives two examples of this, then subverts it:
<ul><li> In an early episode, he wants to date the lady who works at the post office, so he sends himself letters addressed to himself from a fictional woman. Because he can't read, the letters are blank.
</li><li> After he's married and adopts the woman's kids, he doesn't want his kids to know he can't read, though nearly everyone else, even Mary and Laura, knows. John Jr. (the eldest of Mr. Edwards' sons) finds this out, but only after Edwards is attacked and nearly killed by a grizzly bear.
</li><li> In later episodes, he presumably learns to read as if he'd never had a problem. He's seen reading all sorts of things, including a bedtime story to a monkey.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth-season episode "Whisper Country," a secretly illiterate female preacher tries to run Mary out of her teaching job in a remote farming community. When the woman continually misquotes the Bible and gives completely incorrect teachings, Mary suspects the woman's secret and challenges her to show her the verse to back her claims. The woman, in a fit of rage, holds up her Bible (thinking it held a magical power that would kill Mary), but when the tactic failed, the woman admitted she could not read.
</li><li> Averted in the 1978 episode "Harriet's Happenings." In an episode where Mrs. Olesen helps her publishing cousin start a newspaper in Walnut Grove, the fountain of misinformation starts a gossip column. After Nellie loses a spelling bee contest to the son of German immigrants, Mrs. Olesen — in a fit of ego and one-upmanship — sarcastically congratulates the winner and reveals his parents are illiterate. True, the boy's folks could not read English ... but they were fluent in reading German, something Charles eventually exposes in the episode's climatic scene, where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">denounces the newspaper as "yellow journalism"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> None of the Norsemen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings">Vikings</a></em> know how to read or write. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1oign');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1oign" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1oign');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In Real Life, literacy was reasonably common among the Norse upper crust, but Norse culture, like Celtic and Ancient Greek, put a much larger emphasis on the spoken word than the written one. And, of course, the Vikings wrote in runic script, rather than Roman letters </span> The only main character who can do either is Athelstan, but he's also a very well-educated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AngloSaxons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AngloSaxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> monk from Christian England.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman">Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</a></em> found that several citizens of the town—Jake, Hank, Myra—couldn't read, though they all learned at some point in the show's run.
</li><li> Nog on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> doesn't learn to read until Jake, who's younger, teaches him. He manages to get into Starfleet Academy a few years later with only about two years of semi-formal schooling. It's possible though that Jake is teaching him how to read human script, since Ferengi has its own system of writing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven">The Magnificent Seven</a></em> TV series, one episode did this for tracker Vin Tanner.
</li><li> There was an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife">The Facts of Life</a></em> where Tootie's boyfriend turns out to be illiterate.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>, Liz and Pete suspected that Tracy might be illiterate. He wasn't, but he played along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker">to get out of work</a>.
</li><li> Episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> played the grandfather of one of Cliff's patients. Claire tricked him into revealing his illiteracy. Later, he enrolled in classes so that he could read to his great-granddaughter.
</li><li> Sundance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderstone">Thunderstone</a></em> is totally illiterate, which he reveals when his peace offering to Noah for mistreating him is to ask Noah to teach him to read. This is implied to be a rarity even in Haven, as other characters can occasionally be seen reading books or writing notes with no difficulties.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OceanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OceanGirl">Ocean Girl</a></em>, the son of ORCA's head woman was revealed to be illiterate because he was dyslexic. Mike was a jerk who used his dyslexia to get out of things, until Neri helped him learn to read. Then he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turned good</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MamasFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MamasFamily">Mama's Family</a></em>: In the episode "Reading the Riot Act", Mama and Iola get fed up with the crappy job their church lady president is doing and plan to impeach her...until Mama discovers that it's because she can't read.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven">Highway to Heaven</a></em>, Jonathan (the angel) discovers a co-worker couldn't read when he sends the guy into a storeroom to get a box of pies. Of course, Jonathan should have also guessed the guy was an idiot because there were two boxes of pies, and the guy didn't open either to see what was inside. Instead, he left the storeroom and came up with some excuse for why he couldn't retrieve them.
<ul><li> Another episode had Jonathan helping a young man who had been a star basketball player in high school, but his illiteracy was exposed when he became injured and he couldn't stay in college. He takes a job at an after-school program teaching basketball and the kids tell him about their reading teacher when he confesses that he can't read. She helps him learn to read and they begin dating.
</li></ul></li><li> Matt Parkman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> can't read due to his dyslexia, although this does not seem to hamper his detective skills at all. He sucks at Scrabble though.
</li><li> Seth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a></em> is revealed to be illiterate when his girlfriend catches him giving sports tickets to nerds in exchange for them doing his homework, because he, well, can't. The episode ends with, you guessed it, Seth studying to learn how to read. Yay tropes.
</li><li> Salvatore, one of the contestants on the seventh season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a></em>, revealed in one episode that he never learned to read. He was assigned to take the orders from the patrons, but because he couldn't read, he also couldn't write intelligibly. Ramsay started to tear the mickey out of him but was pulled up short when Salvatore revealed that after immigrating to America, he took a job to help support his family instead of going to school.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> when Grace panics when her boyfriend Nathan is less excited about her birthday gift of a book than Karen's gift of a motorcycle. He solemnly informs her that he can't read, and she immediately softens and apologizes, to which he replies "I can read! You've seen me read!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbian</a> "Walter" from German TV series <em>Hinter Gittern - der Frauenknast</em> (English: "Behind bars - The Women's Prison").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes">Good Times</a></em>: Unclear. In one of her criticisms of the series, Esther Rolle complained about over-emphasizing the character of J.J., whom Rolle (in a 1975 interview with <em>Ebony</em> magazine) contended was illiterate but yet was popular among audiences for his clownish antics. In actuality, it had never been explicitly mentioned whether or how well J.J. could read, although several episodes prior to 1977 revolved around his academic struggles.
</li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em> (back when it was still called <em>Good Morning Miss Bliss</em>), a bully is revealed to be illiterate, which is why he forced others to do his homework.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge">Charles in Charge</a></em> one of Charles' friends is revealed to be illiterate when a fire breaks out and he can't read the instructions for a fire extinguisher.
</li><li> Charlie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em> is on the fringe of this trope. When under pressure, he can scrawl out basic English, and seems to be able to read basic words, but when he writes for himself, it's a secret, illegible script that resembles hieroglyphics.
<ul><li> Also, a subversion. The Gang has no interest in helping Charlie learn how to read or write, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoranceIsBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoranceIsBliss">neither does he</a>.
<div class="indent"> "Goddammit Charlie, your illiteracy has screwed us again!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> Lex on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTribe">The Tribe</a></em> is an arrogant, tough, streetwise character... who never learned to read or write beyond a very low grade school level. The series implied several times that he had Dyslexia. It's a major source of insecurity for him, and he does try to improve his skills more than once.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSharpEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSharpEnd">The Sharp End</a></em>, Carmichael is illiterate, and Celia Forrest (his employer) uses a tape recorder to provide him with his daily to-do list.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, Sam's teenage brother Tommy never learned to read because his parents were constantly on the move and exploited his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Animorphism</a> to win dog-fighting matches to support themselves, so he never went to school and they weren't concerned with educating him themselves (Sam himself was put up for adoption and had a normal childhood until his powers developed). He does learn to read during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between seasons 3 and 4, and in a touch of realism, is shown to still have trouble with silent letters and has to sound out the words while writing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons">The Waltons</a></em> episode, "The Scholar," an illiterate but proudly self-sufficient African-America, Verda Grant, woman asks John-Boy to help her learn to read in secret. The boy is proud to help, but his youngest sister spots them and inadvertently uses their exposes them to her teacher to excuse why she is not getting her homework done. When the teacher offers to help the woman herself, Verda assumes John-Boy betrayed her. Eventually, the truth is found out and the two reconcile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge">Porridge</a></em>: "Bunny" Warren claims to be in prison because he could not read the sign: "Warning, Burglar Alarm". He also gets Fletcher to read him letters from his wife. It is strongly implied that he is actually dyslexic.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> had a suspect who was a Mexican immigrant and tried to hide the fact that he couldn't read. His illiteracy ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">a good thing</a> as the real killer had avoided escaping through a door after the murder because there was a sign on it that said an alarm would sound if it was opened.

This nearly costs the worker his life when the inevitable happens at the climax.

In order to be able to read and write, a barbarian must either spend two skill points on "Literacy" or take a level in another class. The reason for the illiteracy varies, such as whatever society he came from having an oral tradition or something similar, but the barbarian entering civilization will have a few problems.
<ul><li> Basic D&amp;D has ability to read based on the INT score. Characters with an int below 6 are illiterate, and those below 9 can handle simple words.

<ul><li> In a Season 1 episode, Krusty the Clown is cleared of a robbery in part because of his revealed illiteracy. In light of later information about him, it's kind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> moment - Krusty is the son of a Rabbi who was being molded for that career, so it's hard to believe he would be illiterate. In fairness, he does have a minimal reading level (and he is a drug addict), which makes this somewhat more realistic. In one of the DVD episode commentaries, the makers mention that they decided to leave out this character trait after a while, seeing as how it really did not make sense that Krusty could not read and yet do the things he does.
</li><li> In one episode, Homer befriends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger</a>. They ask him not to tell anyone that they're in town, and he agrees as long as they keep his secret: he can't read. It's never mentioned again, and Baldwin lampshades it by pointing out that Homer just read the card on a gift basket (Homer says he recognized the logo), so this was probably a one-off joke (or an oblique reference to a scene from the movie <em>Wayne's World</em> in which Wayne tells a girl that he can't read so he can gain her sympathies).
</li><li> In one book about the series, one writer mentions how, during the story conference, they threw around moments throughout the series in which Homer was shown reading, and ultimately decided to go with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.

Fortunately, the description mentions that some of the countries in the red have improved a bit since the map was made.
</li><li> The Mongols and Vikings are well-known for this, largely due to the fact that historians know very little about their <em>true</em> cultures and values because of their inability to record their own histories in anything but their own languages. The vast majority of information we have about them in the West was written by Christians and Muslims, both of whom were terrified and disgusted by these barbarian invaders, which makes the actual beliefs and practices of the Mongols and pagan Vikings difficult to understand or even extrapolate on.
</li><li> While the trope itself has become somewhat clichéd, there are obviously people in real life for which this is true. Also worth considering are cases where someone is dyslexic, and thus has a situation where although they are attending school and being taught literacy, it eludes them until the condition is identified. That said, a shockingly high percentage of people in the US are functionally illiterate. That is, they can read just barely enough to get by but anything more is beyond them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen">Lance Henriksen</a> is one particularly famous example - he dropped out of school before sixth grade and was illiterate until the age of 30 when he started acting and taught himself to read his scripts.
</li><li> There was a widely successful Junior-Major league hockey coach in Quebec who revealed he was illiterate when he retired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> Season 3 winner <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FantasiaBarrino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FantasiaBarrino">Fantasia Barrino</a> was functionally illiterate for years into her performing career; she would perform songs from memory and would make excuses such as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">"Southern"</a> when faced with dense materials like contracts.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Goretti">Maria Teresa "Mariettina" Goretti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was said to be illiterate, which wasn't very uncommon in the times and place she lived (rural Italy in the very early twentieth century). She allegedly still gained the knowledge she needed to get the Holy Communion purely by hearing and memorizing what the local Passionist priests taught her. It's actually a kind-of common backstory among Christian saints, especially those who come from low-class backgrounds. Again, understandable due to the lack of advance in proper education until a relatively short time ago. In fact, a lot of people only learned to read or write <em>if</em> they joined the clergy (or attended a church school), but even then (like the above) it wasn't always so.
</li><li> American baseball star <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had to work 12-hour shifts in a textile mill from the age of 6 or 7 to support his family, and so never went to school. He often had his wife sign his signature for him (meaning memorabilia he autographed himself is very valuable), and when he ate with his team in restaurants, he had his teammates order before him and order the same thing as one of them rather than asking someone to read the menu for him.
</li><li> Brazilian eco-martyr Chico Mendes was illiterate until the age of 18, having been deliberately kept so by the owner of the plantation he worked on, in an attempt to prevent him from learning what exploitation meant.
</li><li> This trope was the norm for most of the world until the Industrial Revolution. Most people worked in jobs in which literacy wasn't necessary, which took up so much time that they didn't have the leisure time needed to pick up an unnecessary skill. Up until the invention of the printing press, this was compounded by the fact that there simply wasn't much reading material available. The single largest group of people with the time and inclination to learn to read in Medieval and Renaissance times was the clergy. This is why bookkeepers are sometimes known as clerks (a word derived from cleric).
</li><li> Adam Carolla was functionally illiterate most of his life. When he started working at KROQ radio when he first got his break into showbiz, he forced himself to learn to read because he couldn't read copy off the cuff and got tired of having to memorize everything for hours ahead of time.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntebellumAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntebellumAmerica">Antebellum America</a>, plantation owners generally tried to keep their black slaves illiterate, lest they get their hands on abolitionist publications. Some states even passed laws against teaching slaves to read.
</li><li> Illiteracy was widespread in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a>, as you'd expect of a backwards, feudal society where most people were peasants. At the time of the communist revolution in 1917, only twenty-four percent of Russians could read. In response, the Bolsheviks began the Likbez campaign in 1919. By the 1950s, illiteracy had effectively been eradicated from the Soviet Union.
</li><li> In a zig-zagged example, in the obscenely poor country of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a>, the requirement for being classed as literate is the ability to write the words <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloriousLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloriousLeader">"Kim Jong Il", the Eternal President</a>, and your own name. Consequently, North Korea has a 99.9% rate of literacy; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">highest in the world</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vangelis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vangelis">Vangelis</a> cannot read musical notation.
</li><li> In an extreme case, teacher <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-43700153">John Corcoran<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> taught for 17 years while being illiterate. He was able to get this far through getting passed from grade to grade, and got through college by cheating on every test. When he began teaching, he would get a few students to be his aides and take attendance for him. His own wife didn't realize he couldn't read until he had trouble reading stories to their daughter. He was finally inspired to learn to read by then-Second Lady Barbara Bush's campaign for adult literacy, and he now runs a foundation dedicated to literacy.
</li><li> Because he was performing in vaudeville as a child and wasn't provided with consistent tutoring while touring, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> was almost completely illiterate <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yxu0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yxu0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yxu0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with the exception of comic books</span> until he joined the Army at 18; he was taught to read by a fellow soldier.
</li><li> (Eddie Shack was a popular NHL player from 1957 to 1975 and was later a successful advertiser and businessman. He was poor and often ill as a child, and after he became a success started up literacy programs.</li></ul></div>
