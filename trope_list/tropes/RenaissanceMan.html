</p><p>Many modern-day professionals work to be an expert in a field, be it mathematics, history, or graphic design. This training is what allows them to not only make a living wage but earn a comfortable life without overexerting their brain.
</p><p>Throughout history, there have been people who step beyond this and have excelled in multiple fields, called polymaths. One period in history produced several of the ones that are now most famous, the Renaissance period. Because of this, today most people know them as Renaissance Men.
</p><p>A Renaissance Man is anyone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> or media who is an expert in many fields, having a broad base of skill and knowledge. Many experts in a field develop skills that are necessary in other fields or find themselves requiring skills in another field. On the other hand, being a Renaissance Man used to be far easier than it is now, simply due to the unbelievable <em>volume</em> of knowledge that five centuries of scientific progress have produced. A few hundred years ago, it would have been reasonable for a single intelligent man to know all of humanity's scientific knowledge, but, well... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>. For these reasons, in the modern age, people who study a lot of topics besides their basic activity fall towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> end of the spectrum instead of achieving true mastery in all of them.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Take, for example, mathematics. Until recently, computer science was the domain of the mathematics department in many universities, and many math courses, such as number theory and graph theory, are still cross-listed with computer science. From physics, in order to study motion, Isaac Newton invented calculus. Sociology makes heavy use of statistics. Bioinformatics is a massive crossover between math, biology, and computer science. Many doctorate-level mathematicians will have experience and skill in one of these overlapping areas, often to the point of being called experts in both mathematics and the other field(s).
</p><p>While the Renaissance Man is similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>, his fields don't need to be limited to science. He also isn't necessarily a master of all known science, just a good chunk of it. The Renaissance Man may suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MDEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MDEnvy">M.D. Envy</a> if people object to calling him a "doctor" because he doesn't practice medicine. This trait may be used to show that yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> is just <em>so</em> insufferably cool. Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass">Cultured Badass</a> will, after close examination, turn out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a>. If this person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a> and wants to end the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>, the Renaissance Man may also be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution">One-Man Industrial Revolution</a>.

In contrast, a Renaissance Man is understood to have boundless potentialwhatever he studies, he'll excel at, because he's just good at whatever he puts his mind to. Put another way, a Master of All is defined by his wide range of skills that are useful in many situations, whereas a Renaissance Man is defined by the ease with which he learns things and applies the knowledge.

To that end, he's read and mastered the skills contained in books on history, religion, philosophy, chemistry, and tactics, as well as miscellaneous subjects such as cosmetics and cooking. Another skill that serves him well in his ambitions is an extensive knowledge of drugs and poisons derived from plants. To round it off, he's a perfectly cultivated gentleman who blends in just as well on the floor of a ballroom as he does on the battlefield.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Sosuke Aizen</a> claims to have maxed out his entire potential as a Soul Reaper long ago, meaning that he has completely mastered all the Shinigami arts which include Zanjutsu (swordplay and Zanpakuto release), Hakuda (hand-to-hand combat), Hoho (speed), and Kido (spells). In addition, he is a tactician brilliant enough to be able to predict most of the actions of the Gotei 13 and Ichigo beforehand, a manipulator and actor so good that he had Soul Society in the dark for decades, is socially proficient enough to garner respect from Shinigami and Arrancar alike using masterful use of charisma, and a calligrapher accomplished enough become a teacher for it. His sheer adaptability is showcased when he simply adjusted to his former superior Shinji Hirako's sensory-reversing Shikai, a feat that Hirako himself noted was impossible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Everyone should already know that Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury is a great student, but there is more to her than that. She's demonstrated proficiency at both CPR and mouth-to-mouth. She also has demonstrated fluency in both English and German. She is a top-ranked chess player, able to compete against chess masters three times her age. She one time was able to fix a car. She has, on occasion, written lyrics for instrumental music she likes. Also she fights monsters in her spare time. And, to top it off, one episode shows she's a talented swimmer.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, she has an unbelievably high IQ and spends a LOT of her time reading. The only reason she is in junior high is that Japan doesn't have a way to deal with geniuses and has to take obligatory education the same as everybody else (she even bemoans <em>only</em> being <em>eight</em> chapters ahead of the class on her "bad" days).
</li><li> Mamoru Chiba/Tuxedo Mask is also widely regarded as one too, having an understanding of a vast knowledge of fields, although lacking Ami's specialized knowledge and raw intelligence he makes up for it by knowing things she doesn't. Like her, he speaks several languages, but also has skills in martial arts, cooking, theater, natural sciences, history, mechanics, investigations, and forensics. This is fitting considering some people like to nickname him "The Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>."
</li><li> Being a star volleyball player and one of the best athletes in the series, singing, getting couples together with her mere presence, bilingualism, strength and agility far beyond what any human (let alone a girl her size) should have, outdoing the police in taking down criminals, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> of the Sailor Guardians and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a>, having the second most powerful attacks out of the Inner Guardians after Sailor Moon, swordsmanship, high-level martial arts (apparently Savate) skills, using ofuda that don't even belong to her, hairdressing, and being an assistant manga artist are some things that Minako Aino/Sailor Venus has under her belt (the last one is the only one she actually called difficult). Though you wouldn't know it, with the way she normally acts around people.
<ul><li> Most of those skills have been learned <em>before</em> the series in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">Mysterious Past</a>, or at least off-page... And are known only because she used them. Considering the hairdressing showed up just once because Usagi's hair had suddenly grown so much she couldn't walk and Minako simply reacted by grabbing a pair of scissors, cutting it back to the previous length and even dressing it back to normal, one has to wonder <em>what else</em> she can do.
</li></ul></li><li> Michiru Kaioh/Sailor Neptune is a famous concert violinist and painter, a powerful soldier, and a champion-level competitive swimmer whose other skills include flying a helicopter, precognition, teaching, cooking, conducting investigations, manipulating people, and getting top grades in every school subject, and she knows something about such varied topics as religion, child care, high fashion, cosmetics, and marine life. And given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">how little is actually revealed about her</a>, that's probably not the end of her talents.

Over the next 25 years, he shows enough battlefield and political prowess become Commander-In-Chief of the Earth Federal Forces with no detriment to his piloting skills. Another 25 years see him retire from the EAF, only to show that his mobile suit skills both in and out of the cockpit haven't diminished at all.

He's also not a bad starship pilot on top of it.

As the first Coordinator he was a sports star, a MIT graduate with PhD at 17, built his own spacecraft and found a fossil in space (literally breaking the genre tradition of Gundam franchises to have no aliens), and gave out the coordinator technology that allowed him to be so smart and strong. However, this led to the problems in series, with many people wanting their kids to be just like him, and many others being jealous of them. Wars started because his desire to create people to aspire led to separate nations of people who quickly degenerated into mutual genocidal desires.

<ul><li> Tyrion Lannister's dwarfism forbade him to ever be trained in combat but the guy knows his stuff with a terribly vast knowledge that spaces from politics to war strategy to engineering to municipal works administration, and despite his dwarfism he's also brave enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">lead men in battle when it's required</a>.
</li><li> Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">being dead by the start of the series</a>, many people remember Prince Rhaegar Targaryen as being talented in several different areas. Rhaegar was very intelligent and studious, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm">often spending hours on end reading in his youth</a>. As he grew older, Rhaegar became also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">exceptionally talented knight</a>. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantClassicalMusician">played the harp and sang (both beautifully)</a> and would spend time alone composing songs that brought people to tears. He was also exceedingly popular with the common folk, a talent in and of itself given that many lords in Westeros can't say the same.
</li><li> Jon Snow is already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">skilled archer and swordsman</a> when he joins the Night's Watch because he started learned when he was five, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">he's also very well-read and has an in-depth knowledge of history and a reasonable grasp on politics</a>. Because of this, unlike most of the recruits, he's positioned to be trained in a variety of other skills rather than constantly learning how to survive a fight, and the Lord Commander himself was grooming him as his successor.
</li><li> While there is some doubt that he is who he says he is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rhaegar's son Aegon has shown himself to be quite talented and intelligent. He reads and writes, is fluent in several languages, has a decent knowledge of mathematics, history, poetry, law, and religion, and has been trained as a knight for most of his life. Especially impressive for a prince is that Aegon has also been taught to be self-sufficient as he is able to cook, wash his own clothes and work with his hands.</span>
</li><li> It is clear that although Jamie Lannister is not very intellectual his training as a knight makes him a Renaissance man in his society. He can read, ride a horse, fight man-to-man, lead an army, negotiate a treaty, interpret maps, and has a reasonable grasp of both the economic and socio-political realities of Westeros.
</li><li> Perhaps the most prominent example in the series, Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne. He is well-spoken and exceptionally skilled with a spear, but he has numerous other talents. As a young man, he studied at the Citadel (the closest thing to a university in Westeros), making strides in several fields before getting bored and leaving. He then went on to travel the world, starting his own mercenary company and developed a talent for poisons. He's also a talented horseback rider. It's also rumored that he studied magic, which seems entirely plausible given his inquisitive nature.

Though primarily an engineer, he has also extensively studied history, human psychology, and philosophy because he believes that it helps him better understand the fallible people who use his products.
</li><li> Judge Holden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodMeridian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodMeridian">Blood Meridian</a></em> is a charismatic, poly-lingual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a> with an exceptional knowledge of the arts (he is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">possibly</a> a judge). Which makes him that much more evil: while the others in Glanton gang are loutish, ignorant thugs without many prospects, Holden could be *anything* he wants and chooses to rape and slaughter his way through the west.
<ul><li> Samuel Chamberlain's account of the (possibly) real-life Holden in his memoirs fits this as well:
<div class="indent"><em>He was by far the best educated man in northern Mexico. He conversed with all in their own language, spoke in several Indian lingos, at a fandango would take the harp or guitar from the hands of the musicians and charm all with his wonderful performance, out-waltz any poblano of the ball, plum centre with rifle or revolver, a daring horseman acquainted with the nature of all the strange plants and their botanical names, [and] great in geology and mineralogy.</em>

Protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">John Rumford</a> has mastered multiple foreign languages, classical literature and poetry, history, philosophy, theology, and the military arts, and then farming, too.

When Karstedt sees him in possession of an elaborate item he shouldn't have easy access to, he assumes he made it himself. This is at least partly justified by his Noble father being a high-ranking Noble who made him come second only to his true-born heir.

The chief medical officer, for example. It takes years to become an expert in <em>human</em> anatomy, but they're conversant in the physiology of many species, albeit with the help of databases and (often offscreen) secondary staff. Even characters who aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">literal medical databases</a> or hundreds-year-old Vulcans are often conversant in classical literature—whether from Earth or not—a couple of scientific disciplines, engineering, history... Starfleet Academy does actually train for this, given that officers very often end up in diplomatic incidents, armed conflicts, uncharted scientific waters, interstellar crimes, or a combination of all those things. (Until the captain asks them to step <em>too</em> far outside the actual job, and then it's "I'm a doctor, not a ...!")

Not surprisingly, as at the beginning of the series McKay was the only scientist in his team, while the other three main characters (Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon) were pilots and combat experts.
<ul><li> Dr. Lee was one of the more extreme examples. On the show we see him assist Jackson on an archeological mission, program a virtual reality machine, study alien plants and animals, hold a position at the space bridge station, build armor and weapons, and offer expertise on many other alien technologies.
<ul><li> And yet, despite all this, Dr. Lee is more often than not, a joke and just not good enough to solve the problem of the week.

While his Doctorates are in Archeology, Anthropology, and Philology, his level of competence in several related fields is easily equal to that of some professionals in those fields. He speaks 23 different languages, is an expert in Mythology and spent enough time with the rest of SG-1 that he can fill the need for a tech expert or combatant in a pinch too.
</li><li> The Doctor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> seems to know pretty much everything as required by the plot - history, science, language, mythology, you name it. One of the spinoff novels quoted him as saying that he had qualifications in everything "except HTML coding and dentistry". Of course, he's hundreds of years old and bright even by the standards of his own sufficiently advanced alien race, which might count as cheating.

He has doctorates in medicine, chemistry, quantum physics, and astronomy, can play the piano and guitar to concert standards, is an excellent singer, can speak seven modern languages and can read a number of ancient ones (including Hieroglyphics) and is familiar with a wide range of martial arts.

In addition to being one of the greatest hackers alive, he is able to also create gadgets seemingly at will and is capable of other random abilities, including impromptu forgery, serving as a lawyer and landing an airplane(as a traffic controller). He also happens to have been a violin virtuoso in his childhood.
<ul><li> Elliot also counts. He's a master in various martial arts(unarmed and armed), a natural athlete, an excellent chef/wine connoisseur, a decent country singer and also knows a thing or two about high fashion(he dates a lot of supermodels).

In fact, he angsts about not being able to decide what career to pursue, since he excels equally at everything he tries.

But where this really comes into play is his vast stores of knowledge in multiple subjects not related to medicine that he uses to solve the more difficult and perplexing cases that he strives for. In addition, it has been shown that when he puts his mind to a new task he can become a complete master of that craft within days of taking it up.

His degrees are in physics and chemistry, and he served as a bomb defuser in the Vietnam War; some years later, became a field intelligence officer for the DXS; then left that job to be a troubleshooter on any number of issues for the Phoenix Foundation, a think tank and government contractor. All of this left him with a truly dizzying number of skills in many different fields. He can fix just about any machine, find multiple unintended but perfectly functional uses for them, and sometimes build new ones out of scrap parts. He can break in and out of just about any facility in the world, no matter how secure, and is a fairly competent thief, con artist, smuggler, and all-around trickster. He's just as good when working on the other side of the law, as shown the numerous times he's helped the police investigate a crime or performed an entire investigation by himself. As a troubleshooter for Phoenix, the projects he's tasked with have been in fields ranging from scientific research and development to international diplomacy to environmental surveying to social work.

Update 1.9, however, introduced Legendary Skills, which allowed you to reset a skill after maximising it while keeping the character levels and perk points gained, meaning you could now gain levels and perks indefinitely and thus, with enough work, get all 251 perks in the game, making your character a master of every single skill.

<ul><li> Sunset Shimmer, Princess Celestia's former student. She's highly intelligent and very well-educated. She has good intuition and a quick wit, adjusting well to chaos and confusion. She's incredibly physically fit, able to run like the wind, throw herself horizontally like a javelin, and handle a sledgehammer like a baseball bat. She's very charismatic despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">fiery</a> temper, a good if impetuous leader, enormously brave, and strikingly beautiful. All this made her a pretty impressive villain, coming close to conquering Equestria despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">the most limited resources and powers of any major antagonist we've seen on the show</a>. After she turned herself around (or more specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">after she recoiled from what her ambition had led her to,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">and decided to try another way of life</a>), she's done some pretty impressive things for the forces of harmony. (She's also had both ends of the spectrum of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWingsEvilWings">Good Wings, Evil Wings</a>, so there's that, too. But she's hot-headed and tends to go off half-cocked; she's not exactly self-aware or reflective; and she thinks, incorrectly, that she's really good at being sly.)
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia's current student, is much less physical and athletic than Sunset; but she's more magically powerful; and while Sunset is well-read, Twilight's an academic-level researcher. She knows less about horse princess magic than Sunset does, but she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> neurology equipment in her basement and knows quite a bit about how to use it — and she's also a very talented physicist, chemist, and historian, among other things. Her good study habits even allowed her to do quite nicely in a Ponyville marathon, despite her being a little on the chubby side. (But before she was sent to Ponyville with a specific royal order to make some friends, she was a shut-in, with no significant friendships and no particular interest in them.)
</li><li> Pinkie Pie, the playful, perky, pink premier party planner of Ponyville, is a Renaissance Mare in her own way. She's the most social pony in Ponyville; she knows everyone's names and birthdays, and keeps detailed psychological profiles in a hidden room under her bakery; and she has all the skills she needs to support her love of parties: she's a superb baker, a good singer and musician, a good decorator and event planner, an excellent psychologist, a skilled zoologist, a talented artillerist, a brilliant mechanic, and a genius engineer. She's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Wrong Context Magic</a> and can travel through mirrors more conveniently than the most talented wizards of her setting.

He was the first practitioner of all three of those disciplines in recorded history, and is therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">the earliest known</a> polymath. He designed the very first pyramid,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3b5w4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3b5w4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3b5w4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A step pyramid. It still counts.</span> which still stands today, almost 5,000 years later. So gifted and influential was he that, after his death, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">deified</a> by the Egyptians—one of the very, <em>very</em> few commoners (possibly the <em>only</em> commoner) ever to receive that honor.
</li><li> Pythagoras (c.580-c.490 BC), a Greek mathematician and philosopher of 6th century BC who founded a school in south Italy and a philosophical system, Pythagoreanism, named after him. Pythagoras was thought to be a polymath by his contemporaries. He is sometimes credited with coining the term "philosopher", literally a "lover of wisdom," and considered among the first to follow this vocation. The Pythagorean theorem of geometry was named after him. However, having his critics killed probably helped his reviews.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384-322 BC); a Greek philosopher, a student of Plato and teacher of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>. He wrote on many subjects, including physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology. He numbers among the greatest polymaths of all time.
</li><li> Archimedes (c.287-c.212 BC); a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Lived in Sicilian Greek town of Syracuse. Often considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Archimedes is noted for several advancements in almost every relevant field in his era.
</li><li> Eratosthenes (c. 276 BCc. 195 BC) was a Greek mathematician, elegiac poet, athlete, geographer, astronomer, and music theorist. The <em>inventor</em> of geography, and first person to measure the circumference of the Earth, Eratosthenes was nicknamed "<em>Beta</em>" on the grounds that he was second-best in the world at everything.
</li><li> Cao Cao (died 218) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">fame</a> was a skilled horseman and archer (which is typical of the nobles of his age). However, Cao was also the single most successful warlord of his era (having defeated nearly all his rivals within a space of a few years despite being much, much weaker), a noted poet (he and his sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi are credited with the creation of an entire school of Classical Chinese poetry), a scholar (he wrote a commentary on Sun Tzu's Art of War that made it easier to understand, then distributed it to his generals for them to study), an innovator (he was the first Chinese warlord to make extensive use of cavalry as massed forces rather than skirmishers and scouts like most others did, he also implemented the use of stirrups to make his horsemen more effective) and a highly talented politician who effectively rebuilt the ruined Han Dynasty from the ground up.
</li><li> Ibn Sina, better known to the west as Avicenna. A Persian polymath best known for revolutionizing Medicine and Philosophy was also a Mathematician, a Geographer, an Astrologist, a Poet and a Musician.
</li><li> Avicenna's long term pen pal Al Biruni was quite the Renaissance Man himself, most of his surviving works are on Mathematics, Philosophy, Anthropology and History but he was also an excellent Astrologist/Engineer/Alchemist/etc

Hunyadi (aka "Corvinus") of Hungary</a> (circa 1443-1490).

He was also a widely known patron of arts, and a vivid bibliophile, his famous library the "Corvina" at the time of his death contained some 2500-3000 codices, the second largest at the time, behind only the Papal library in the Vatican, and it also had a press machine. In addition he was a skilled financial officer, who managed to create a system that provided him with a yearly income matching that of the King of France. Also a gifted politician, he easily disarmed every political opponent and conspiracy he faced. He also reformed the judicial system, which likely contributed to his quick ascension to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a> status following his death, where several stories claims he roamed the lands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInCognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInCognito">Incognito</a>, to spy on tyrannical lords and punish them afterwards, and help the needy, and reward the worthy. Last but not least he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">famous tourney champion, and celebrated war general</a>. Tellingly, until the Second World War his army was the only one to ever capture Vienna with a siege, in 1485.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1452-1519) is probably <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">codifier</a>, though many of his inventions never came to fruition in his lifetime. He was, however, an expert in anatomy and civil engineering, skilled in many forms of artistic expression, and interested in many areas of science.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> (1469-1527), author of 15+ works including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">The Prince</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiscoursesOnLivy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiscoursesOnLivy">Discourses on Livy</a></em>, was a philosopher, playwright, judge, civil servant, general, and diplomat.

</li><li> Matteo Ricci (1552-1610); Italian Jesuit and a phenomenal figure in the East-West scientific exchange in China. "Matteo Ricci was the perfect man of culture, a polymath versed in all things, mathematics and literature, philosophy and poetry, mechanics and astronomy." In collaboration with Xu Guangqi, he was also the first to translate classic Confucian texts into Latin and classic Western texts into Chinese (including portions of Euclid's Elements).
</li><li> Rene Descartes (1596-1650), working in pilosophy, medicine, mathematics and physics. He wrote up the first explanation of phantom limbs, the shape and size of the rainbow - proving it was caused by water droplets, explained the ring of light sometimes seen around the moon, developed Cartesian coordinates and proved his own existence. Also challenged anyone in Paris who would dare claim he had a bastard son to a duel (he had a <em>daughter</em> out of wedlock).
<ul><li> He was in a position to make good on his threat of a duel, too: in addition to the above Descartes also served as a mercenary soldier in Bavaria <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">apparently for the fun of it</a></em> and drew inspiration from his battlefield experiences.

Not only did he study geology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">ancient Egyptian</a> hieroglyphs ("decoding" occult meanings that probably weren't there), astronomy and microbiology(in his time a new science), he designed a "cat piano" played by making the cats squeal in pain.
</li><li> Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton">Isaac Newton</a> (1642-1727). Thought himself a theologian first of all. Is more known for wave optics, calculus and what is known to us as, well, "Newtonian Mechanics". Tried alchemy, astrology and numerology. As the Master of the Mint, developed at least one currency protection measure, changed Britain's monetary policy and personally conducted investigations.
</li><li> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). Jurist, diplomat, librarian, historian and theologian, but best known as a philosopher and mathematician. Got into a priority dispute with Newton over differential calculus, but it is his notation system that we still use today. Did pioneering work on binary numbers and worked on language theory. Helped set up the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
</li><li> Peter Peter Alexeyevich (1672-1725). AKA Peter The Great. Along with being tsar of Russia a he studied and practiced sailing, shipbuilding, city planning, engineering, dentistry, barbering, painting, commercial trading, economics, and diplomacy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> (1706-1790). In addition to his studies of electricity (and the kite experiment was a minor footnote), he also developed the basic principles of meteorology, charted the gulf stream, worked on advanced heating technologies all his life, invented swim fins and a new musical instrument, expanded his one print shop to have satellite print shops in every colony, and then sold them off once he decided he was rich enough to stop working. During his business days, he established the first American lending library and the first university (UPenn) that wasn't devoted to training clergy. He also was the Colonies' ambassador to France, and despite the Declaration of Independence being a forbidden document, he ultimately talked the king into putting his own government in hock to pay off the Revolutionary War. And he's also the main reason why the Constitutional Convention included the option for passing amendments.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> (1712-1786), king of Prussia. Practically the trope namer for "enlightened absolutism" who made his country one of the great European powers and one of the leading strategists and tacticians of his day. Also a flute-player and composer, a poet and a writer on subjects ranging from works on philosophy, history, and military theory to opera librettos and satires.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (17431826): Political revolutionary, drafter of the Declaration of Independence, President, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, these are just some of Jefferson's fields of expertise, and he is considered one of the most famous polymaths in American history. Famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F.

</li><li> A claimant for the honor of "the last polymath"—albeit more on the humanities side of the spectrum—is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> (1749 - 1832). His works spanned literature, drama (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust">Faust</a></em>), science (morphology, mineralogy, and colour theory), law, philosophy (where he is considered one of the greats) and religion.
</li><li> About the last true polymath was Thomas Young (1773 - 1829), who made fundamental contributions to physics (wave theory of light), engineering (Young's modulus), and biology (how the eye worked). Oh, and he also helped to decipher the Rosetta Stone. He has been described as "The Last Man Who Knew Everything".
</li><li> Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (1776-1822) graduated as a jurist and entered the Prussian administration, but his real interest lay in music (which is why he changed one of his names to Amadeus, after Mozart) and he was a talented cartoonist, which got him into trouble with his superiors. After he lost his government job due to Prussia's defeat of 1807, he became musical director of a theatre in Bamberg and later of a troupe in Saxony, composing several operas, for which he also designed the sets. But it was only when he turned to writing that he achieved his worldwide fame as a master of the fantastic whose influence can be seen in the works of several writers and composers. He is also credited with writing the first German crime novella.
</li><li> Adelbert von Chamisso (1781-1838), a French nobleman who fled from the Revolution to Prussia, became an officer, poet and novelist writing in German (his <em>Peter Schlemihl</em> became in international best-seller), and also an explorer, working as a cartographer and resident scientist on the second Russian circumnavigation of the world. As a botanist he was so good that he managed to discovering and naming a number of unknown plant species during a reprovisioning stop in England, a country itself well-supplied in naturalists of its own. He also wrote the first grammar of the Hawaiian language.

Having done that, and come up with some innovations in Arctic clothing and equipment, he went to university to study zoology, conducted research in marine biology (during which he came up with principles that helped form the basis of neurology), and then took up oceanography, conducting important research and inventing new scientific equipment that is still in use. Apparently getting bored of that, he took up diplomatic work, helping to secure the independence of his native Norway from the King of Sweden, and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the Great War</a>, served as High Commissioner for Refugees for the League of Nations, organizing relief efforts which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.

</li><li> Robert Williams Wood, 1868-1955. Was one of pioneers of physical optics, both research and development. Such as inventions and applications in out-of-visible spectrum photography and astronomy, spectroscopy — and animated pictures. Boomerang enthusiasm, automobile enthusiasm and introduction of surfing in USA. Invention of a way to unfreeze plumbing and development of submarine detection by sonar. Forensics: as an explosives expert, introduction of UV lamps (detection of forgeries and <em>the</em> countermeasure which depreciated "invisible inks") and discovery of explosively formed projectiles. Discovery of hydrogen recombination and disproving radiation theory of greenhouses (they work because glass stops <em>hot air</em>). The first proposal of using tear gas as an incapacitating weapon and quack hunt, including un-discovery of N-rays (physical optics was "his" territory).

</li><li> This is pretty much a requirement to be an astronaut. Space agencies are extremely strict and picky, so the more skills and interests you have, the better you'll look on the application. To even be considered, you need to have a degree in a STEM field (more than one is better), pass a lot of physical challenges and have good communication and problem-solving skills. You also need a lot of flying experience to be a commander or pilot, speaking multiple languages is necessary for international space projects, and once you get accepted, you'll get cross-trained in a lot of other fields. Some examples:
