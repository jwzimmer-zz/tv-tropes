</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">very serious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> is undermined because it's presented by a work that just <em>cannot</em> handle it well.
</p><p>This is especially common in children's shows. There are many, many cases where a well-meaning show for children tries to explain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">a newsworthy issue</a>. Sadly, the characters just usually end up way out of their comfort zone and the message often goes <em>way</em> over the poor kids' heads, often because it's so different from the normal tone of the show.
</p><p>Note that this isn't always the fault of the writers. Any attempt to tackle serious subject matter honestly is problematic when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> are watching. This is often because many attempts to deal with such serious subject matter will usually have these Guardians responding with outrage <em>at its mere inclusion</em>! Yes, even if you are explicitly attempting to discourage it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>And so you often end up with children being warned about something dangerous â€” but exactly <em>why</em> that something is dangerous is often never explained (which is why this trope can be a rich well of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a>). It's hard to tell kids "don't play with power tools because you might get killed" when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">you can't say die</a> (so expect to hear something like "very, very badly hurt"). Likewise, gun safety is an improbable issue to address when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">everyone packs a laser gun or something</a>. Most infamously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">drug abuse</a> isn't easy to deal with when you can't quantify <em>why</em> you shouldn't use drugs, or when you can't even acknowledge that drugs exist.
</p><p>Things other than censorship can cause this. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a> are uses as an easier to depict and better fit for the setting allegory, only to introduce issues that undercut the applicability (e.g. an anti-racism Aesop in settings with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> races). The work's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> means the lesson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">has to be forgotten</a> or will lack the intended consequences.

A Clueless Aesop is when some fundamental <em>out-of-universe</em> feature of the work or its authorship (such as being written for children) leads to them being unable to address an aesop appropriately, while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> is when an aesop is undermined by <em>in-universe</em> events (e.g., "Be nice to people who are different from you. Now, let's go back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">fighting monsters</a>!"). This can also overlap a lot with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a>, where the aesop doesn't work because of factors in the genre or worldbuilding.
</p><p>The typical reaction is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">Don't Shoot the Message</a>.
</p><p>Also do not confuse with any Aesop delivered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clueless">Cher Horowitz</a>.
</p><p>See also some examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">And Knowing Is Half the Battle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateAesopInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateAesopInterpretation">Alternate Aesop Interpretation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">You Can Panic Now</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">Too Smart for Strangers</a> are especially prone to this. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostAesop">Lost Aesop</a>, which tries to set up an Aesop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">but forgets about it by the end</a>.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">Spoof Aesop</a>, which is when a Aesop is deliberately made inept for comedy so is not to be taken seriously. This can overlap with Clueless Aesop if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be serious or not</a>.

<ul><li> In the early 1990s, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">MegaCorps</a> would send, ostensibly out of the goodness of their hearts, free "educational kits" including lesson plans, worksheets, and other materials to elementary school teachers. In truth, they were really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">unsubtle advertisements for the company's products</a>. These were often heartwarmingly/hilariously/heartbreakingly misguided. One of the most infamous such lesson plans doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>: "Let's learn good nutrition with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">Ronald McDonald</a> and friends!"
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a> satirized this with typical aplomb in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/cheatcommandos4.html">Commandos In the Classroom.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>
</li><li> This was also parodied by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> with a math class sponsored by Pepsi. "If you have three Pepsis and drink one, how much more refreshed are you?". The answer "Pepsi?" received partial credit.
</li></ul></li><li> Another example was the D.A.R.E. group in the late 1980s through the '90s that tried to encourage kids to not do drugs and in their educational kits they included a pencil with the slogan "Too Cool To Do Drugs". Unfortunately, because they set their slogan not to start at the eraser end but at the lead end of the pencil - under the assumption most kids using it would be right-handed, since that orientation would let them read the slogan as they used it - as it was sharpened, the slogan devolved on the pencil from the original message, down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">"Cool To Do Drugs"</a>, to simply "Do Drugs", to just "DRUGS", as if the pencil was becoming increasingly desperate to get you to try some drugs.
<ul><li> A similar incident happened on a smaller scale for some rubber wristbands for red ribbon week. The slogan on the wristbands: "I've got BETTER things to DO than DRUGS". Observant students quickly noticed the message in all caps. Despite the mistakes the exact same design is still in production.
</li><li> Another problem is their excessive focus on resisting peer pressure, which can easily come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">"everyone is doing drugs except you"</a> and/or "if you don't do drugs, as we are asking, prepare to be bullied and ostracized for it".
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvjFsZJqAPs">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">Digital Piracy Is Evil</a> ad from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> using a scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em>. Only trouble is anyone who has seen the movie knows Rick is actually angry at Ilsa for <em>resisting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazis</a>.</em> While not as uncomfortable in terms of subtext, the one where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a> yells at Dorothy and company for pirating media doesn't make sense either.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfEG15CLTqo">"Don't Drown Your Food"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a PSA about not overloading your foods with high-calorie condiments, but the message is so vague that it makes it seem as if you shouldn't put any condiments on them at all.
</li><li> There's a 2013 Canadian PSA about "social nibbling" as an allegory to social smoking. It shows a man in various social situations, taking food off of other people's plates, nibbling it, and giving back, while he denies that he's hungry. It supposed to be about how you are in denial if you say you only smoke socially, but without being told the Aesop at the end, it could just as easily be about how you should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateAesopInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateAesopInterpretation">buy your own packs</a> instead of bumming them, as one could do this and still insist they only smoke socially. There's one about "social farting" that's at least as confusing.
</li><li> Here's an example that doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>: In the early 90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> ran several PSAs about the need to turn off the television and go outside. Around that exact same time, they ran a network promo depicting a kid being left alone on a baseball field, because all of his friends are <em>in the living room watching Nick</em>.
</li><li> An infamous PETA PSA showed a girl screaming at seeing her father beat her mother, an old woman scream as a pair of muggers attack her, a boy screaming as bullies mob him... and a fish opening its mouth as it's about to be cut up and cooked. The message was "Not all screams can be heard". Leaving aside the comparison of a fish's suffering to a human's, there's the fact that restaurants don't typically prepare a fish while it's <em>still alive</em> (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikizukuri">not to say that none do<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but the practice is already controversial without PETA's help).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lL07JOGU5o">Pantosaurus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a song about a dinosaur that teaches against "bad touching". It Zigzags this trope, because while the song averts it (it clearly says the good, understandable phrase "Your private parts belong only to you. If someone asks to see, just tell them no."), the animation looks like Pantosaurus is just shouting, "No!" at random people.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">Public Service Announcements</a> with an anti-drug message were so poorly executed that they practically made a joke of their own message. The point is especially lost because most of them do not seem to portray any <em>other</em> consequences of doing drugs.
<ul><li> One of the weirdest ones by far is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">If you take pot, your girlfriend will leave you for a space alien</a>".
</li><li> Pee-Wee Herman gives a serious (yet somehow hilarious) message about not doing crack. Of all the people to do an anti-drug message, it's children's TV's king of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">What Do You Mean, It Wasn't Made on Drugs?</a>" Any message would probably be garbled by the question of whether he's doing a bit or not.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLZptx6UQLk">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>... is <em>crack.</em>"
</div><ul><li> The anti-drug PSA where the girl's dog talks to her and asks her to stop smoking pot. Honey, if your dog is talking to you, pot is the least of your problems. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFAN3wdlrJg">At least he's trying to help.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> An early "Above the Influence" ad showed two teenaged boys smoking pot in the office of the father of one of the boys. One of them noticed a gun on the desk and picked it up absently. When his friend asked "is it loaded?" he said it wasn't and fired, presumably killing his friend. The intended message was probably something like "marijuana will impair your judgement in life-threatening ways." But the danger came off as so contrived that message could easily be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">don't leave a loaded gun with the safety off on top of the desk in your unlocked office when your thirteen-year-old son is in the house.</a>" Which, of course, is <em>also</em> a good lesson.
<ul><li> An alternate version was a little more reasonable. A bunch of teenage yahoos get baked and decide to prank a fast food restaurant by repeatedly rolling through the drive-thru and placing ridiculous orders. On the last time through, a little girl is riding her bicycle across the lane just as the driver hits the gas...
</li></ul></li><li> There was another odd set of anti-drug ads where a girl high on weed is shown (through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">icky special effects</a>) to have melted into the couch. Doug Benson has a terrific deconstruction of how clueless this ad was in <em>Super High Me</em>: if your reaction to an anti-drug PSA is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">"Whatever they were smoking, I want some"</a>, it has failed.
</li><li> The "Brain On Drugs" PSA's are infamous for this. The original 1980s version compares frying eggs to what drugs can do to your brain. The 1990s version involves Rachel Leigh Cook smashing an egg and then breaking everything in her kitchen, all while comparing the destruction to what heroin will do to you. They're supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a> PSA's but they're more confusing than anything. As a result, they've been parodied for years. In the 2010s, a new PSA campaign lampshaded just how useless the original ad was by showing it then showing teenagers asking actual questions about drugs.

<ul><li> Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Sinnoh</a> rival Paul was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to anyone or PokÃ©mon who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">didn't meet his standards</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Ash objected</a> other characters lecture Ash about how everyone has their own ways of doing things which should be respected. Besides being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> as they were defending Paul despite him being far more disrespectful to others over their differences, the show was so lighthearted that the frequency and seriousness of Paul's abuses made him worse than most of its clear-cut villains. Were it not for the forced Aesop, Ash would have every right to judge him. Notably, in much earlier episodes of the series, Ash was allowed to rightly call out other people for being jerks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveCondemnation">when they did the exact same sorts of things that Paul did</a> (such as Damian, who abandoned his Charmander because he thought it was too weak). Thankfully it seems the anime caught on this, later on more characters began to call out Paul and Paul himself only becomes a happier person once he realizes how bad his philosophy is.

The irony of course is that the censored version was far closer to Shudo's intended portrayal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>: Like several other works by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a>, the series tries to send the message that your love for someone is valid regardless of age, gender or sexual orientation. This would be a pretty powerful message to a young female audience who would likely be experiencing crushes for the first time, reassuring them that their love isn't silly or shallow and that even if nothing comes of your first crush, your feelings are still real. However, this doesn't really work with how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">relationships between students and teachers</a> are presented, <em>especially</em> with the relationship between Mr. Terada (a man in his 30s) and Rika (a 10 year old girl) in the manga; having a crush on your teacher is one thing, but having the teacher actually return those feelings only seems to promote predatory relationships instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">BNA: Brand New Animal</a></em> attempts to be a race allegory using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beastmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beastmen">beastmen</a> and humans. Regardless of how well one feels it managed to do that in the first half of its run, the second half of the series almost renders it mute by dropping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that beastman are genetically predisposed to violence: when sufficiently stressed out, Beastmen can and will uncontrollably transform into terrifyingly powerful monsters that will blindly maim and destroy anything in their path. Meaning that humans are perfectly <em>justified</em> in not trusting their anthropomorphic brethren, which is the exact opposite idea you want to plant in a series that had just spent several episodes going "racism is bad" and just had the main character admit to and apologize for their irrational bigotry the episode before. Even though the show ends with the characters curing this affliction, thus making it a non-factor for the future of this world, it's hard to forget the fact that they accidentally undermined their anti-racism message an hour prior.

</li><li> Back in the late 1980s when AIDS was still the new pandemic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> sometimes included a full-page PSA featuring Principal Weatherbee telling the students: "Your best defense against AIDS is <em>education</em>", but didn't say anything else. So, where is this education we're supposed to get?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders">Ken Penders</a>'s run tended to try to cover really heavy themes (fascism, colonialism, genocide, abuse, drugs) that the comic just could not handle. These ideas would be tricky in any story, and a major uphill battle in a <em>Sonic</em> comic, but Penders tended to not help by waffling between horribly tasteless real-world imagery and cartoony adventure logic. One arc involved a paraphrasing of "First They Came", but with actual persecuted groups replaced by echidnas and hedgehogs, but then just twelve issues later, had Knuckles trusting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Nazi-analogue group</a> completely and defending them so they could team up for the greater good.
</li><li> A particular example was the case of Locke. Penders claimed that Knuckles's relationship with Locke, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>, was meant to be a study of the difficulties involved when someone's relationship with their parents isn't perfect, having based it on his own issues with his father. Unfortunately, this doesn't really pan out when the comic doesn't really explore the difficulties of that relationship; Locke is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> and Knuckles interprets his actions as having been wholly good, leading to most readers getting the opposite impression.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>:
<ul><li> In the 80s there was a one-shot called <em><a class="urllink" href="https://comiconlinefree.com/heroes-for-hope-starring-the-x-men/issue-Full">Heroes for Hope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> in which the X-Men take on famine in Africa... which, as everyone knows, is caused by an ancient demon that feeds on human misery. The demon in question was established to be merely a consequence of the misery in the area, which was caused by far more complex causes, but it was very very easy to interpret the story as "Africa's ills are caused by an ancient demon". At least Marvel gave the proceeds of the comic to charity.
</li><li> In retrospect, Mikhail Rasputin's quasi-introduction falls into this category by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> â€” Peter Corbeau compares his death to the real-life Apollo 1 fire... except that it was later revealed that Mikhail hadn't actually died, but had been sent to another dimension, gone insane, and come back as a supervillain.

</li><li> In general, if not done well the metaphor of mutants representing various oppressed groups victimised by those in power can quickly start to fall apart when you remember that, unlike the members of the real-world oppressed groups they're used to represent, many mutants often have dangerous superpowers that non-mutants and even <em>many other mutants</em> would have legitimate reasons to be concerned about.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Century: 2009</em> and <em>Tempest</em> volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> critiques twenty-first century popular culture and fiction as being decadent, hollow and inferior when compared to the culture and fiction of previous generations. Which is all very well and good, but many reviewers and critics (such as several members of the discussion <a class="urllink" href="http://mindlessones.com/2012/06/26/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-century-2009-thoughts/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) pointed out that it's pretty clear that Alan Moore also has little to no idea or interest in what's actually going on in 21st-century popular culture and fiction. Moore himself has been vocal about his lack of engagement with a lot of central elements of modern popular culture (such as the Internet and contemporary cinema); accordingly, unlike previous volumes of the series, there are few direct references to contemporary culture and fiction, and many of those that are present are inaccurate, questionable or still somewhat outdated (as in hailing from or being more relevant to the 1990s or early 2000s than the 2010s). This means that for many readers the work is less of the searing indictment of contemporary fiction and culture it was intended to be, and more of Alan Moore coming off as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Grumpy Old Man</a> complaining about things he doesn't really understand or care about.
<ul><li> <em>The Tempest</em> also features tirades bitching about modern popularity of superheroes, whom Moore accuses of being a plague on the human psyche, promoting fascism and at one point even compares them to the <em>Ku Klax Klan</em>. It gets worse when you realize that, not only is this irrelevant to the main plot of the comic, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">we never actually see any superheroes being a detriment of any sort to human society</a>. Furthermore, the superheroes who happen to be supporting characters use their abilities to help the heroes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> abandon Earth during the apocalypse and make all their new allies immortal</span>, and no ethical qualms of any sort are made.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> attempted to depict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a> conflict over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a>, but did so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">a setting</a> that had always universally held the opinion that such things were unambiguously <em>bad</em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> stayed out of the entire debate since in their own comics, government registration of mutants was always portrayed as the first step towards state-sponsored internment/genocide of anyone with an X-gene. Further, Mark Millar and Marvel editorial's intention was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">to portray both sides making good points in the argument</a> but ultimately come down with the Pro-Registration side winning, depicting them as the more reasonable side. Yet they <em>also</em> had the Pro-Regs doing monstrous things like throwing people into the Negative Zone or threatening heroes into compliance over the Pro-Reg laws, despite the fact that the law hadn't so much as been written yet. So we're supposed to root for them as they commit horrible crimes and prove the Anti-Reg's argument about the SHRA being fascist? Compounding this was the fact that many of the writers disagreed about which side was supposed to be right, leading to loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">Armed with Canon</a> fights. One book would have Iron Man stopping an extremist Anti-Reg vigilante, only for another to have him casually imprisoning innocent people in the Negative Zone without a trial (or even being charged with a crime). Mr. Fantastic was given <em>three different reasons</em> for being on the Pro-Reg side, necessary because Mark Millar made him pro-Reg despite vehemently opposing this back in older Fantastic Four comics. The overall sense of the plot is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">nobody really knew how to handle it</a>.

And the dragons were suspects because all the evidence at the time pointed to the arsons being caused by dragon fire, meaning racial profiling would be an objectively valid tool in this fanatical setting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJayWalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJayWalking">It also had very little to do about Spike and Princess Luna's friendship</a>.

Many other plot details (like having Scarlet Witch, a Romani, join the fascists) and the accidental white supremacist imagery created by having Fash-Cap wielding Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer being a symbol used by many real-world hate groups), combine to show the setting wasn't suitable and the writers too clueless about the subject to handle it tactfully much less intelligently enough to make a valid point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesInCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesInCrisis">Heroes in Crisis</a></em> tried to tackle the issue of mental health and how important it is to get help. To this end, writer Tom King used superheroes as an allegory for soldiers, establishing the superhero mental health facility called Sanctuary, where superheroes â€” and some villains â€” would go to seek treatment with anonymity. The story depicts a massacre at the facility which King has said is an allegory for mass shootings. Later on, the murderer is almost said to be redeemed because they released the recordings (which existed for some reason) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>, who then released them to the world (thankfully after blurring out their faces and identities), with the message supposedly being that people should be open about needing help, so others will be willing to seek help too. The message has been roundly criticised for the sheer inapplicability of it, and the allegory for how it just doesn't work, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">aesop</a> is considered terribly executed and even <em>offensive</em>. The "therapy" present is incredibly unhealthy, consisting entirely of superheroes utilising a VR room to let them "work through" whatever it is they feel like, with the AI in charge of the facility â€” who is the only "therapist" there â€” <em>only</em> prodding them with questions that seem <em>outright</em> intended to mock them, such as asking Wally West why he keeps wanting to see his missing family, over and over again and even allowing self-harm in patients such as allowing Lagoon Boy to repeatedly relive his death. Not once is its methods called into question, and the ending has Sanctuary re-opened with zero indication of any reform in how it works, implying it's a good thing. The way the massacre happened â€” via innate superpowers â€” means it <em>can't</em> be an allegory for mass shootings at a mental health facility, because those places wouldn't let someone keep a loaded gun with them! Finally, the message of being open about seeking mental health completely ignores that nobody at Sanctuary knew they were being recorded, consented to the murderer leaking their sessions to Lois Lane or consented to <em>Lois</em> releasing their sessions, even with their faces blurred. In the real world, this would at best be seen as a <strong>massive</strong> breach of privacy and get the murderer in (more) trouble and get Lois Lane sued into the Fifth Dimension.

<ul><li> This is why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IWillSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IWillSurvive">I Will Survive</a></em> is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a>. It's an abortion-themed comic based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>. Yes, <em>Zootopia</em>, the Disney family-friendly film about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a>. While <em>Zootopia</em> does deal with serious issues such as racism, stereotyping, political/social unrest, and bullying, abortion is on a <em>completely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">different level</a>. It's even more surreal since the theoretical child is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">half rabbit and half fox</a> - something likely impossible in canon. To make things worse, the main point of the comic was <em>actually</em> to show that even a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> could easily break up given the wrong circumstances. By using a controversial topic like abortion as said circumstances and depicting Nick, with his pro-life views, as having the upper hand in the argument, readers missed that point entirely and saw the comic as an anti-abortion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> until the comic's creator clarified his intentions, and many held roughly that view even after that.

It doesn't help that in the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a> plays a heavy role: The Boggans are ugly, and the animals they use as mounts (bats, grackles, and a star-nosed mole) are ones that are generally disliked by humans, whereas the Leafmen are all good-looking, and ride hummingbirds. It's almost as if the message of the movie was only to accept the parts of nature that are cute looking while rejecting all the parts that aren't pleasant. Ironically, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-decay-important-to-the-ecosystem">rot and decay are very important to keep an ecosystem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Thus, the movie presents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">an environment</a> where it makes sense for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Smiler</a> to want Gene deleted for a relatively small transgression. And yet the movie never truly calls out this system based entirely around serving an owner, despite the fact that the Emojis were momentarily deleted. Also, a film filled with constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> is a terrible way to get across social commentary about smartphones.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> isn't the humans who are destroying the rainforest, but Hexxus, an ancient demon of pollution who is freed from his prison in a tree and proceeds to destroy the land around himself. Likewise, it is the fairies' magic, not any environmentalist effort on the part of the humans, that ultimately defeats him. This makes the film's message seem to be "Pollution is caused by magic demons, and only more magic can stop it."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbieVideoGameHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbieVideoGameHero">Barbie Video Game Hero</a></em>'s message is that you shouldn't let yourself feel confined to one path and think outside the box. This is all well and good in general and for Barbie, who gets the means to basically code a whole new game from the inside by the end of it. In real video games... you kind of do have to stay within the confines of whatever limits the programmers put in and can't code your way out. To do otherwise is going outside the rules of the game, and going outside the rules of a game is cheating, which is not such a good message for a kids' movie to have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wizards">Wizards</a></em> spends the entire film building up the conflict between a good, druidic wizard who lives in harmony with nature and who draws his power from all living things and an evil wizard who's reinventing mass production, firearms and munitions, and whose conquering armies are threatening to plunge the world back into the chaos of technological warfare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">and then the good wizard shoots and kills the evil wizard with a gun</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the Aesop was supposed to be about propaganda, the movie setting up the Aesop and intentionally breaking it because it's denouncing the idea of letting the words of others do your thinking for you. The only reason technology is bad and nature is good is because <em>everyone says so</em>. The good wizard is the only character who doesn't buy into the hype and recognizes that what the villain is doing is harmful, but it's the <em>villain</em> that's the problem, and it is perfectly fine to use technology to solve it. But the average viewer, without being told such, misses this in lieu of the more apparently obvious and familiar message "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">technology is bad, being close to nature is good</a>".

This in turn undermines the film's message, since if something that <em>mild</em> is all it takes for him to spin out of control, it becomes questionable whether the kid either has psychological problems already or if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">his mother's overreaction</a> had something to do with it. Doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> as well, since none of the problems brought about by his porn addiction are actually, directly related to it - he also becomes addicted to energy drinks from drinking them whenever he views porn, which could have happened from chugging them during <em>any</em> regular activity, and the rest of his problems are from a woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">taking violent offense</a> at his hesitance to sleep with her when he already has a girlfriend, up to and including accusations of beating and raping her, with the only link to his porn addiction being that she was the actress in some of the porn he watched.
</li><li> A segment in the 1959 film <em>The F.B.I. Story</em> tries to show why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> are bad and botches it by turning them into very superficial villains. According to the film, the Klan were bad guys because they broke the law (they're lumped in with gangsters and other enemies of American law and order); their racism is never mentioned at all, and their Antisemitism is touched upon as timidly as possible (they're shown ransacking a Jewish household and knocking over a menorah, but the word "Jew" is never uttered and the narrator merely mentions that the Klan had contempt for "ancient rituals"). The Klan's biggest crime in the film â€” the one for which they end up getting punished â€” is attempting to murder a white (and presumably Christian) liberal journalist who condemns them in his newspaper editorials. Even kids who watch this movie will understand that the KKK are bad; problem is, they'll think it's because they're a gang of bullying ghosts.
</li><li> The infamous 2006 remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan2006">The Wicker Man</a></em>, according to the director, was meant as a feminist treatise told through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip">Persecution Flip</a>. His supposed intention was to show what patriarchal values would be like if reversed. The actual result is a bizarre movie about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">a bunch of insane women</a> torturing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">bees</a>. One gets the sense that the director didn't really understand the subject matter. The concept of tackling sexism in a <em>Wicker Man</em> remake is an odd one in and of itself; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWickerMan1973">original film</a> was about a <em>religious</em> cult, not the psychotic misandrists the remake depicts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfDavidGale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfDavidGale">The Life of David Gale</a></em> is very clearly against the death penalty, by trying to show that an innocent person can get executed. The problem is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rather than showing someone who's a victim of circumstances or a frame-up, which would perfectly demonstrate its point, it shows the victim trying to "prove" that innocent people can get executed by framing <em>himself</em> for a crime he didn't commit, in the hopes that he will be exonerated and the death penalty will be abolished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">after he's wrongly executed</a>. Interestingly, the film <em>does</em> seem to be at least somewhat aware of how clueless this looks; the whole plot comes about partly because the governor in the film made a statement that he would call a moratorium on further capital punishment if anyone were ever wrongfully executed, but once this actually does happen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">he refuses to do so</a> because the state can't be held accountable for someone abusing the system <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">to deliberately kill themselves</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyLive">They Live</a></em> is an allegory for the evils of unchecked Capitalism and Reaganomics, depicting the rich and powerful, as well as members of the police force, as alien invaders infiltrating and subverting our society. Unfortunately, since aliens are, by definition, outsiders, many Neo-Nazis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">took this movie as a validation of their beliefs that Jews were running a secret cabal to brainwash society</a>, much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://news.avclub.com/john-carpenter-thinks-internet-nazis-need-to-quit-misin-1798255923">chagrin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carnosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carnosaur">Carnosaur</a></em> tries to preach a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> about the dangers of man destroying nature with machines and that nature belongs to the animals, but it is undermined by being a movie about killer dinosaurs and Dr. Tiptree's solution of eradicating the human race through artificial means.
</li><li> The pedophilia awareness PSA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrickyPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrickyPeople">Tricky People</a></em> made an admirable attempt to be serious and would have actually been pretty effective... had the creators not decided to include the ridiculously cartoony Barney-esque character of Yello Dyno. And if that wasn't enough, they give the evil pedophile a wacky, bumbling sidekick, who provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a></em> tries to do an anti-nuclear weapons message. Emphasis on "tries", as it attempts to dilute such a complicated and controversial subject into a very overly-simplified "nukes are bad and cause all war" kind of message that takes a back seat to the film's action and is treated as a means to an end, yet is presented as if it's the focus and if the action somehow portrayed that message. Even ignoring all of that, and even if it was such a simple issue in real life, the movie <em>still</em> fails to get the message across as getting rid of nukes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">unleashes Nuclear Man and leads to war</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></em> got a pretty cold reception in part for this, as the attempt to tackle subjects like the rise of real-world fascist regimes and the tragedies of the early 20th century through the eyes of an extant and active society of wizards couldn't really work no matter how you framed it. Either the wizards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct">somehow couldn't prevent those atrocities</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">they were A-okay with what was going down</a>, both of which would make wizarding society as a whole completely unlikable. The end result ended up seemingly being that they had to stop the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Grindelwald's fascist regime</a>, or otherwise he would reveal himself to the Muggles, take over the world and... stop the Holocaust from happening.
</li><li> <em>The Life Zone</em> is an anti-abortion screed. However, if one were to describe the plot, it would seem to be the exact opposite. The film is about three women who are kidnapped and held against their will by a man calling himself their "jailer" who only ever speaks to them through a television screen and forbids them to speak to him unless he specifically addresses them. The women are also forced to watch pro-life propaganda while they're being held against their will. If that weren't enough, the movie also sets up extremely easy strawmen for it to knock down; such as a man (played by the director) asking a man why, if it's not okay to kill a baby one minute after it's been born, it's okay to abort a baby one second <em>before</em> it's born. Or one of the women making the argument that abortion is morally correct just because it's legal. Or arguing that the kidnappers aren't oppressing women because one of them is a woman herself. If that <em>still</em> wasn't enough, the film ends by revealing that the "jailer" is actually <em>Satan</em>, the two women who turned against abortion were possibly fallen angels, and the third woman (who refused to give in to the anti-abortion message) will now spend the rest of eternity in hell.
</li><li> A direct-to-TV PSA film, <em>The Day My Kid Went Punk</em>, is supposed to be about the dangers of punk behavior in the late '80s-early '90s. Except that the "punk" kid only dresses a certain way, which is to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuincyPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuincyPunk">stereotypically punk-ish</a> (leather jacket, make up, hair, etc.). In all other respects, he is still a <em>model kid</em>: he gets excellent marks in school, he shows empathy and concern for a young girl and helps her out when she's clearly distressed, and he's unfailingly polite and respectful of those around him. His <em>parents</em>, on the other hand, are dismissive of his <em>existence</em> to the point of outright ignoring him when he's trying to tell them things, which is particularly jarring considering the mother spends most of the PSA concerned about her upcoming speaking engagement <em>about the dangers of punk kids</em>. The "lesson" imparted by the PSA ends up being "don't dress like a punk because people won't take you seriously", and it even fails <em>that</em> because the only people that don't take the kid seriously <em>are the parents</em>. The actual takeaway from the film is that parents that ignore their kids until they stand out by exercising personal freedom of expression (aka non-conformity) are tyrannical and horrible.

<ul><li> Aesop's fable, "The dog and the wolf" is about a wolf, near-dead with hunger, meeting a dog. The dog says that if the wolf had steady work and steady food like dogs do, he'd be much better off, and the wolf quite agrees, but he's a wolf so no one will take him in. The dog assures him that he can get him a job on his farm, and the wolf accepts, until he finds out that the dog gets chained up by a collar at night, at which point he returns to the woods to die. The moral is "better free and starving than enslaved and fat", but fails when confronted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>: If the dog could wander off to the woods to meet the wolf in the first place then clearly he has all the freedom he wants and could probably wander off whenever he wanted. The wolf doesn't really refuse to throw away freedom for food, he refuses a job where he'd have to be at the right place at certain times and wear a collar as a uniform.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> On the surface, the series is a safe, clean, nonviolent fantasy serving as a cautionary tale about the dangers of premarital sex. Bella is certainly tempted, but Edward does the good Christian thing and pressures her into getting married first. This is all well and good, except it's coming from the same story that portrays an emotionally abusive ephebophile stalker as romantic. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real world</a>, teenage romances do not last forever, and marriage is the last thing that random charming attractive guy will pressure unsuspecting women into. The lesson is outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">contradicted</a> in the final installment, when the pregnancy turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">bloody, gruesome, and nearly fatal</a>. Marriage does not protect from STDs, nor does it physically or emotionally prepare one for pregnancy. And the first time they actually sleep together after their wedding, it's a violent event that leaves Bella injured and the bed destroyed. The Aesop here seems to be less "Wait until marriage" and more "Don't have sex ever."
</li><li> <em>Twilight</em> is simply not the kind of series that should be having a debate about abortion. Also, the pro-life/pro-choice thing is slightly irrelevant <em>when it's clear that the baby is most assuredly killing the mother, and she may or may not survive to give birth</em> (in other words, exactly the kind of exception most pro-life advocates are willing to make when it comes to their stance on abortion).

The horses in the book aren't anthropomorphized in any way, so you have the surreal experience of a horse with a joint sticking out of its mouth being treated with the utmost seriousnessâ€”and that's aside from the fact that it portrays "marijuana overdose" as lethal.

Not only was this such a fantastical allegory most didn't pick up that Aesop, but the House Elves are effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">Happiness in Slavery</a> portrayal is identical to how many real-life slaves in the past were portrayed by their owners as an excuse to justify owning slaves. There's also evidence that, as in real-life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror">their "enjoyment" of servitude is forced</a>, as they're psychologically conditioned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm">physically punish themselves severely</a> if they fail a task or disobey their masters. The closest the series comes close to decrying this is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy">it's wrong to enslave them if you're an abusive master, not that it's wrong to enslave them at all</a>, which fails when <em>Deathly Hallows</em> reveals even a loving and well-meaning master can accidentally lock an elf in an infinite loop of failure and self-punishment by incautiously giving them an impossible order. That the closest real-life equivalent to this issue is something that we would be completely justified in opposing shows how unsuitable the Aesop is for the setting.

<ul><li> There was a Public Service Announcement at a local TV station which used its puppet mascot and tried to explain the difference between "good touching" and "bad touching". The trouble is, they used footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoons while they were talking about "good touching"... including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>'s cross-dressing smooches on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd">Elmer Fudd</a>, and multiple shots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepeLePew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepeLePew">PepÃ© Le Pew</a>. Someone clearly wasn't paying enough attention when that PSA was made.
</li><li> There was a brief flare-up of PSAs that instructed children to go and get an adult if they saw or read anything on the Internet that made them uncomfortable, without quantifying what such things might be. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">the number of things</a> one can find online that can make <em>grown adults</em> uncomfortable, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">medical images of a graphic nature</a>, this seems a little ill-thought-out (but at least parent and child can sit and stare at the walls for a while together).

</li><li> The religious kids show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bibleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bibleman">Bibleman</a></em> uses the superhero formula to lure in kids, but has the problems it tries to comment on caused by supervillains. Usually the imperiled kid of the episode is shot by a sin-inducing laser gun and starts acting badly out of the blue, doing nothing to address the kinds of real-life things that cause these behaviors the show is saying you need to avoid. There are a couple of episodes where the villain's influence exacerbates a problem the kid's established as already facing (i.e. the kid's faith is weakening because his parents won't stop fighting), but the show doesn't bother to do it consistently. And this is compounded by how Bibleman inevitably ends up afflicted by the same thing as the kid to show that he's just a human who's vulnerable to the same things everyone else is, but it's usually established even more poorly than for the kid he helps, losing the point.
<ul><li> At times it even becomes confused about the point of its existence. A few episodes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qaz7');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qaz7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qaz7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Shattering the Prince of Pride" and "Jesus Our Savior" for instance</span> have Bibleman try to stress people need to pay attention to God and not to him, because he's just a person like everyone else. Not only is this mangled by most episodes having somebody specifically call Bibleman and ask him to solve a loved one's personal problems, the point of the show would seem to be making religious lessons more appealing to kids by having a cool hero who gets to use a lightsaber promoting them. It's a worthwhile message, but it falls apart coming out of the mouth of someone created to be an attention-grabbing mascot.
</li><li> In its anti-cheating episode Biblegirl gets a message that Bibleman needs to meet with her right away. Biblegirl takes a shortcut out of the building, which is cheating, because she falls into the villain's trap. Yeah cheating isn't good, but...getting there as fast as possible when someone needs your help counts somehow?? Really?

In the story, Arnold (Gary Coleman) wants a bicycle. After becoming friends with Mr. Horton, the owner of the bicycle shop, over part one, he, and his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">Dudley</a> (<em>Diff'rent Strokes</em>' recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> scapegoat), start spending time with Horton in the back room where he lives. After riding on Mr. Horton's back and playing "Neptune, God of the Sea," Horton offers them some alcohol (which only makes Arnold worried that he might be caught with it on his breath) and sits them down to watch some cartoons. "That mouse just lost his drawers! <em>[audience laughter]</em>" Yeah, so after enjoying a nice X-rated cartoon, Arnold is uncomfortable enough to leave. Dudley wants to stay, and Arnold goes home. After letting slip what happened, Mr. Drummond calls the police. They arrive right as Horton is about to... uh... begin. Dudley appears on screen drugged with tranquilizers and shirtless. Then they have a couch conversation about how important it is to tell an adult about such things. While this is admittedly far more direct and open than the "bad touch" PSAs of the 90s, there is laughter throughout the episodes right up to when Mr. Drummond calls the police. Yes, even during the set-up to the molestation. That must have been the most awkward studio audience ever. Making it worse is that Shavar Ross (Dudley) came out later saying he was repeatedly molested by a family friend during the show's run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> According to writers Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, the intended message of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators">"The Dominators"</a> is that the hippie movement is bad because they would have got their arses kicked if they'd been in control when the Nazis had invaded. However, the oppressed, pacifistic Dulcians don't really work as a hippie allegory, as they're characterised either as elderly politicians or as attractive young people who unthinkingly repeat the elders' lessons by rote until the Doctor and companions turn them against their racist, fascist oppressors, while the old Dulcians get slaughtered through trying to negotiate with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> aliens. As a result, the final product ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">carrying the exact opposite message</a> the creators intended.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E4NightmareOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS17E4NightmareOfEden">Nightmare of Eden</a>" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a> story about intergalactic drug smugglers. It started out quite reasonable and relevant (and in a show that had been and later continued to be quite good at dealing with serious political issues in an allegorical format) but all three series lead actors, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LallaWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LallaWard">Lalla Ward</a>, were concerned that the script might glamorize drug use to young viewers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a> was renamed from the vaguely fun-sounding 'zip' to the nonsensical 'vrax', and everything about why anyone might want to take the drug was removed, with the result of turning vrax into something instantly addictive and invariably fatal that doesn't even make you very high.

However, by the end of the episode, the people in charge of Kerblam! decide to scrap most of the robots and re-introduce a human-majority workforce. The decision to continue menial wage labour in a society that is clearly quite capable of transitioning into a fully-automated, post-scarcity society isn't condemned, and the assumption that wage labour is necessary to provide people with livelihoods is not challenged.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Perhaps the most infamous and obvious example was in the season 3 episode "I Kissed A Girl," which was supposed to be about LGBT acceptance after Santana was outed as a lesbian against her will in the previous episode. For starters, despite the title, there were no girls kissing. Rather than focusing on the actual lesbian character, the episode was made all about the atonement of Finn, the guy who outed her, which consisted entirely of suggesting the Glee club do songs "by girls for girls." This wasn't helped by the girls performing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a>'s "I Kissed a Girl", which, rather than being a lesbian anthem, is a paean to bi-curious experimentation, making it sound like Santana is just going through a phase rather than being an actual lesbian.
</li><li> Another example would be 4x18 "Shooting Star" where they had a school shooting... but the gun going off was entirely accidental and didn't hurt anyone, and a teacher covered for the student at fault. So there were no actual consequences for the student who brought a gun to school and caused gunshots and terrified the entire student body and faculty.
</li><li> There's also <em>Glee</em>'s harmful portrayal of eating disorders in season 4. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160305052803/http://proud2bme.org/node/510">As Catherine Weingarten says<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "Marley was convinced to become bulimic to avoid becoming like her [morbidly obese] mother. The mean girl Kitty easily convinces Marley that in order to play the part of Â“SandyÂ” in <em>Grease</em> she has to look a certain way. Marley does not even seem to understand that Kitty is getting her to experiment with dangerous eating disorder behavior. So Marley becomes fully bulimic and later even passes out during sectionals, which prompts everyone in Glee club to hate her. There is so much misinformation here about how one gets an eating disorder and the seriousness of eating disorders. <em>Glee</em> makes eating disorders seem campy and not very serious. We are supposed to be annoyed by Marley and not even care when she passes out at sectionals." There is also Liana Rosenman who wrote, "It is really dangerous [for <em>Glee</em>] not to include a public service announcement of the dangers of eating disorders." and "Marley has an eating disorder for two days and then magically recovers. That is far from the truth. I struggled with anorexia for five years." Other people have published similar sentiments: "One topic <em>Glee</em> has failed horribly at covering is eating disorders. Eating disorders are often life threatening and last night's episode of <em>Glee</em> made it nothing short of a joke."
</li><li> Coach Beiste coming out as female-to-male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> and beginning the transition process in Season 6 was supposed to carry the message that you're never too old to come out and live your truth. The show was trying to cash in on growing transgender visibility in the media, but Beiste was <em>already</em> popular with transgender/non-binary viewers for being a masculine, cisgender, straight woman who was upfront about her feelings and insecurities, since she proved that gender expression isn't always cut-and-dry. Making her trans actually made her <em>less</em> interesting a character, since it carried the implication that if a woman is a tomboy, she must secretly identify as a man.
</li><li> The episode focusing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em> had the unfortunate idea of trying to use the film and its surrounding culture as an icon of the struggle of being an outcast and finding people like you, while also doing its level best to skate around the fact that the reason it picked up that culture was largely its themes of homosexuality and transgenderism, to the point of editing out the word "transsexual" in its cover of Sweet Transvestite and giving the role to a woman. The result is a surreal mess where the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">is constantly told</a> how meaningful <em>Rocky Horror</em> is, but the film itself is conveyed through a handful of incomprehensible scenes shown out of context that come across as less "media for the marginalized" and more "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em>."

Oh, and they each contained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">the usual happy covers of popular songs and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spots</a> and were each aired in the middle of a week's worth of otherwise completely off-the-wall fantasy episodes with magic robots and such.

<ul><li> The episode with Mr. Bickley's blind son seems to have multiple Aesops: accept handicapped people, learn to see life in a new way, don't abandon your son...

Just to give an example of how poorly executed this episode was, they used the "Does your guide dog get scared when you're skydiving?" joke.
</li><li> "Hold That Mork"'s Aesop was about gender equality. Nothing wrong with that, but it was delivered through the plot of Mork joining The Denver Broncos <em>cheerleaders</em>. Even if the message is good, let's face it, the whole point of the episode was really about providing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> for both the male viewers and, apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirls</a> with a cross-dressing fetish.

In fact, possibly more so than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>.
<ul><li> The 1998 episode "Rust Buckets" is a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">example</a> of this, and just <em>could not</em> handle the episode's issue (non-roadworthy vehicles) well.

</li><li> The episode "Unfit to Drive" from the 1996 series, "Enough's Enough" from the 1997 series, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the 1997 episode "Don't Look Back In Anger" tend to sometimes forget what the Aesop they're dealing with is.

There's one problem, though: the students are too preachy, pretentious, and focused on making the performance edgy to <em>properly convey the message</em>. Example: in one of the sketches, the students sing a song about "who <em>really</em> runs the world".

The problem is that vampires had spent <em>thousands of years</em> killing, raping, torturing, and enslaving humans, sometimes literally treating them as livestock, and even a young vampire like Jessica is <em>far</em> more powerful than a human or even most other supernatural beings. Add to that the "Coming out of the Coffin" movement that kicked off the show, and humans have <em>every reason</em> to hate and fear vampires and take measures â€” legal or otherwise â€” against them.

That may be a common criticism of beauty pageants <em>today</em>, but that criticism comes from beauty pageants being seen as a means for young women to spend excessive amounts of money and effort in competition for vanity prizes like crowns and titles. The pageant <em>in the show</em> is taking place in an ancient Greco-Roman fantasy setting, and the prize for the winner is <em>a winter's supply of food for her village's children</em>. We're still supposed to root for the contestant who quits in order to preserve her pride and dignity, even though she entered the pageant to help her village, and competing for their sake is already pretty noble.

They are separated by a line in the middle of a road and they are not allowed to mix with one another. Now, the story looks like it's heading towards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> when an oil drop runs across the road and collides with a water drop. But the story focuses on how together they make a pretty rainbow. And then all the oil and water drops start playing together. The message was <em>supposed</em> to be "it's wonderful when people who are different play together", but unfortunately children will probably interpret it as "go ahead and pour oil in the sink/bathtub/etc. to make pretty rainbows". Also, oil and water are not well-known for mixing together. It (hopefully) should be blatantly obvious that generally oil <em>should not be in water</em>.

The original intention of the video was to promote an aesop about tolerance, sometimes of androgynous or LGBT individuals; however, the video forgets about the Aesop and becomes more about a display of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> of the Barbican Estate in London (although LGBT banners and the flag do appear, it only gets a small amount of screentime), that it had some people, pundits, radio presenters and the blogosphere/social media questioning what the actual message of the video was meant to be.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> song "You Need To Calm Down" is intended to be a song about standing proud in the face of anti-LGBT prejudice and how this prejudice is steeped in irrationality, but its "fuck the haters" attitude and the lyrics identifying the entirely straight Swift as a target of hate made it come across more as "the trials of dealing with homophobia are equivalent to me having a feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj">Nicki Minaj</a>, and its spiteful, senseless prejudice is just as pointless and disgusting as disliking me, a multi-million-dollar pop star."

Keep in mind that this show features Bubbles the chimp as a character and a production number with a giant sequined glove dancing around, among other things.
<div class="indent"> During [the number] dancing robots appear with LED breastplates that first flash dollar signs amidst videos of urban and international violence, then display hearts as Mother Teresa appears onscreen to feed starving children. The number was originally designed for Jackson's This Is It shows (performances that were preempted by the artist's demise), so Cirque can't entirely be blamed for its unseemly exploitation of human suffering for commercial entertainment. Of course Jackson would have seen himself as raising awareness, and Cirque doubtless think the same thing about the pro-Gaia number ["Earth Song"] that unfolds as 30,000 people sip from souvenir plastic cups.

It's set in the 1980s in the shadow of the AIDS crisis, many of the characters are avant-garde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Starving Artists</a> and it has designs towards being edgy, challenging and confronting. However, because it was also a major Broadway musical in the 1990s, it couldn't necessarily be <em>too</em> edgy, challenging and confronting lest it chase away the paying customers. This meant that it tended to focus more on the struggle of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">True Artist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> being faced with the prospect of having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut">Sell-Out</a>, with AIDS being mostly treated as a romanticized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease">Victorian Novel Disease</a>. Furthermore, the show tended to take a "drop out and reject the system" attitude rather than a "fight and challenge the system" approach â€” which, given that the AIDS crisis actually resulted from numerous systematic institution failings, incompetence and outright callous indifference which were ripe for angry critique and challenge, means that it's arguably pushing the wrong lesson to take.

Ragou was caught red-handed <em>feeding people</em> to his pets and was punished with a slap on the wrist.

Sodia later attempts to kill Yuri because she thinks of him as a criminal. This is supposed to question Yuri's actions and show that justice is sometimes a very subjective thing.

<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">Bad Touching</a>." The big problem with this, and other episode tags and PSAs like it, is that shows in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> were allowed and encouraged to warn against sexual molestation, but were forbidden to define it. They could tell kids to tell parents or the cops about "bad touching," but they couldn't say what <em>sorts</em> of touching are bad. Unlike the majority of these PSAs, however, the Sonic Sez one at least manages to come close to defining it, and successfully says <strong>something</strong> worthwhile, by explaining that "if someone touches you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's no good. It's your body; no one has the right to touch you if you don't want them to." It still blatantly suffers from the inability to fully convey what it attempts to, and from the incongruity of having Sonic the Hedgehog awkwardly trying to discuss the topic, however.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYxQgjfeoDU">This Sonic Sez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which attempts to teach the respectable lesson that you should only dial 9-1-1 in a real emergency, but fails due to the example of a non-emergency it uses. Sonic and Tails are being attacked by Robotnik's minions, and Tails suggests calling 9-1-1, but Sonic tells him that this would distract emergency workers from other, worse emergencies, and then defeats the villains by himself, since <em>he</em> can do so easily. Thanks to this poor choice of example, Sonic inadvertently tells kids that "If you're being attacked by people who mean you harm, calling 9-1-1 would be a dumb joke." Sonic can defeat bad guys fairly easily, but "don't call 911 if you think you can probably handle the life-threatening situation" isn't a great message.
</li><li> In a spectacularly ridiculous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBDtu2AmktA">Sonic Sez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the intended lesson about medicine is eclipsed by the absurdity of the situation. Grounder falls while chasing a rabbit, and drops a container of pills in the process. The rabbit goes to take them for no obvious reason, only for Sonic to stop him and read the label on the bottle, which says "for Grounder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">robot headache pills, take one a day with oil</a>".

</li><li> Another episode talks about graffiti and vandalism, which it did an okay job of explaining... followed immediately by the dangers of using spray paint, which will apparently explode if shaken (despite instructions on the can saying to do just that) or create a cloud of poisonous gasses, which it will only do if used in an enclosed space, which wasn't mentioned despite the characters being outside at the time.

<ul><li> The series as a whole often falls victim to this trope, largely due to the fact that it chooses to depict pollution and other types of environmental destruction as being caused by solo supervillains who are doing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just to be dicks</a> (with the occasional exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Looten Plunder</a>), rather than ordinary people who aren't aware of their impact on the environment, don't care when there's a lot of money being made in the process, are concerned but can't do much about it because greener alternatives aren't available (e.g. if you decide to switch off all coal power plants, how are you going to make electricity now?), or are even simply cogs in a much larger polluting machine who just don't have the clout to change things for the better on their own. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, this was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">necessary evil</a>, as they didn't want to make the villains too "real" and accidentally imply to the children of loggers or factory workers that their parents were evil villains.

And marijuana users are apparently angry, semi-violent hoodlums a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness">Reefer Madness</a></em>. When that cartoon was broadcast in prime time in Italy, it was preceded by an "insanely long" and "insanely boring" message by the then-Prime Minister. American children were treated to a similar message from Bush, Sr. And Aussie kids got one from Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Kind of funny in retrospect, as he's the Prime Minister celebrated for downing a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale">yard of ale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in eleven seconds when he was younger (making it into the Guinness Book of Records), so you have to wonder what else he got up to back then. But then, this is Australia, where you're looked upon as weird if you don't like to get smashed at least occasionally. Apparently, the special was not advertised as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> prior to it first airing, fooling kids into thinking that it was going to be a purely fun crossover cartoon super special.
</li><li> While most of the Circle Time interstitials that used to air on Playhouse Disney (now Disney Junior) could get simple aesops across to their target audience of preschoolers pretty well, the lesson to be learned from the saga of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIA0XmnspHo">Crying Jack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doesn't make much sense in relation to the problem at hand in the live-action segment. A youngster is unhappy because she doesn't know what to draw, so the host of the segments tells the story about Crying Jack. The story details a happy-go-lucky boy who, for no stated reason, suddenly decides to cry as much as he can, and ultimately he cries so much that he turns himself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">giant walking and crying mouth</a>. The fact that Jack just starts crying for literally no reason makes the moral of the story (possibly intended to be a "getting too upset won't solve your problems" type of moral) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bmrj');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bmrj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bmrj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Or "It's bad to ever express any sadness/negativity!" which is <em>not</em> the kind of aesop you want a vulnerable young audience to see in a time where depressive disorders which can stem from hiding negative thoughts out of shame or fear have been brought to light.</span> come off more like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Never cry or else you run the risk of turning yourself into a giant crying mouth</a>".

</li><li> The obligatory 'drugs are bad' episode... had its moments. A fungus that the sewer-dwelling mutants chew for energy is concentrated into a dangerous drug (RPM) by the Shadow Master, who uses it to enslave people to him. So far, so good. Vortex started taking it to be a stronger fighter and smashed apart a training dummy in a fit of rage when it was suggested it wasn't exactly a good thing. Then the Shadow Master deliberately exposes Billy to RPM after he captures him, and it looks like an interesting setup of addiction vs willpower, and how Billy vs Vortex might recover... and then Dragon Magic cleans the junk out of Vortex and Billy. We never see what happens with the other addicts, above and below, or any consequences, not even for Vortex having drugs around the dojo where <em>kids</em> come to take martial arts lessons! Also compare the episode where Jimmy gets addicted to The Third Eye of the Dragon. Both eps are less 'drugs are bad' and more 'magic fixes everything'.

They do agree... on this being the worst performance they'd ever seen. Brought up again when the bison are about to call off the attack, but Pinkie Pie celebrates by singing another verse, enraging them and causing them to attack anyway. In a more meta sense, the episode tries to create a scenario of irreconcilable differences illustrated with the bison (themed after Native Americans) and the ponies (themed after cowboys), but because it's a kids' show that discusses friendship and conflict resolution, there really <em>is</em> a satisfying compromise for all involved (essentially, a lease agreement from Buffalo to Ponies), and that requires the historical basis to be <em>heavily</em> sanitized to be appropriate for children.

It unintentionally came off as "Atheists/Scientists/Skeptics are jerks and are demonstrably wrong." This could more or less be a realistic scenario in the sense of how science and logic aren't always the best ways to come up with an answer, but considering it's being applied in a show that regularly uses magic and spells to do a multitude of everyday tasks, it seemed like splitting hairs.

Because of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Cartman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">likes him even more</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">imagines himself</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitlarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitlarious">as Hitler</a>.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS5E7ProperCondomUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS5E7ProperCondomUse">Proper Condom Use</a>" the school decides they need to teach the kids about safer sex â€” without actually talking about sex. So they just tell the kids that boys always need to wear condoms, or else they might get girls pregnant, and leave it at that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. At the end of the episode, Chef specifically calls this out, points out that the people teaching the sex ed (Mr. Garrison, Miss Choksondick, and Mr. Mackey) are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">misguided</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">misinformed</a>, or just plain clueless about sex themselves, and says that if the parents want it done right they should do it themselves. Although in a straighter example of this trope in action, Chef himself often had a bad habit of singing songs about sex to the children, which doesn't leave him much room to criticize.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E13ButtOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E13ButtOut">Butt Out</a>" has the anti-smoking group of the same name come to the school and put on a presentation against tobacco usage which is so lame, so unimaginably childish, and so poorly thought-out that all it does is make the kids utterly miserable, while simultaneously giving no <em>actual</em> reasons whatsoever why smoking is bad. Worse still, they end on the message "If you don't smoke, you can grow up to be just like us", which of course prompts the kids to <em>begin</em> furiously smoking to avoid ending up anything like the thing they just saw up on stage.
</li><li> Of course, <em>South Park</em> also has several unintentional examples where the animators want to send a message despite having extremely limited knowledge of the subject at hand. For example, in "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000," Token insults Cartman, and Cartman angrily punches him out, and even though Mr. Mackey punishes him, the authorities burst through the door and throw Cartman into juvenile detention for committing a "hate crime". The episode argues that violence against minorities shouldn't be treated as worse than violence against anyone else if bigotry has nothing to do with the attack. Except <em>hate crime laws don't work that way in the first place</em>. Prosecution has to <strong>prove</strong> that the attack was motivated by the victim's minority status; it isn't just applied by default like the episode claims.
</li></ul></li><li> A case of this due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> caused the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em> episode "Mister Skinnylegs" to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">stricken from Australian airwaves</a>. The plot of the episode is that spiders shouldn't be considered scary and are okay to have in the house. While that works fine in the show's native Britain, it's unacceptable in Australia because the country is <em>loaded</em> with venomous spiders, and actually includes some of the most dangerous spiders <em>in the world</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note41yuw');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note41yuw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note41yuw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To put this in perspective, a <em>short</em> list of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianWildlife">dangerous Australian spiders</a>" would include the ubiquitous Red-Back Spider (basically a Black Widow with anger management issues), the White-Tailed Spider (highly venomous, and suspected of being the infamous "necrotizing spider", a spider whose bite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">causes your flesh to start rotting away whilst you're still alive</a></em>) and the Sydney Funnelweb (a highly aggressive pseudo-tarantula known to have the most powerful venom in the world).</span> Understandably, Australians don't particularly want small children to think it's okay to play with these things.
