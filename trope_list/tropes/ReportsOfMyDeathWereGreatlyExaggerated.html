He just went after the mutant that killed Krillin and Bulma already declares him killed in action, not even considering the possibility that he might still be alive. King Piccolo thought the same thing after their first battle where he seemingly killed him; he was quite surprised when Goku arrived to save Tien.

Turns out, Lyon managed to cut the bomb off Racer and then shielded them both with a hastily-crafted ice wall, though the effort briefly knocked him out, and he returns with Racer as Gray is preventing Sherry from trying to murder Natsu and Lucy. He nearly invokes this word for word.

</li><li> The pirate Jack was reported dead after he picked a fight with Issho, Sengoku, and Tsuru. However, the Mink Tribe, which was recently attacked by Jack, giving a sample of just how freakishly strong he is, worry that he might be alive because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>; And he is, injured, but alive and more than furious that the newspapers wrote him off.

He gets both his arms broken, and is shot by Vorona with a ballistic knife.

It's confirmed that he did survive, though none of the characters know of his whereabouts as he never returned to Ikebukuro and thus never told anyone he was alive.

</li><li> Tracer was thought to be gone after the prototype fighter jet she was flying had its teleportation capabilities malfunction and cause the craft and her to vanish, until Winston saved her with technology that prevents her from jumping about the space-time continuum.
</li><li> Hanzo was forced by his organized crime clan to kill his younger brother Genji, and Genji was thought to be dead as a result. In reality, Overwatch saved his life, giving him a new cyborg body. The revelation that Genji is alive leaves some rather deep-seated issues within Hanzo, who had been paying respects to the presumed-dead Genji every year until Genji in his new body showed up.

<ul><li> In the same comic, Ana is surprised to see Widowmaker at all, as she had been presumed dead after her disappearance following her (Widowmaker's) husband's death.

As a result, it's a game mechanic that orcs who have been promoted to Nemeses can heal up from presumed-fatal blows you dealt them in your last encounter and return to fight you again. They can even survive getting severed in two! In <em>Shadow of War</em>, your own Branded Orcs can likewise potentially shrug off killing blows and return to service.

<ul><li> After "The Shredder Strikes Back Part 2", the Foot believed that the Turtles and their allies were killed in the fire at April's antique store. This was due to Baxter Stockman faking proof in order to steal an Utrom exoskeleton from Shredder. The Turtles would take advantage of this by launching their own sneak attack in "Return to New York".
</li><li> This has happened to the Shredder multiple times. First, the Turtles thought he was killed by the collapsing water tower at the end of "The Shredder Strikes Part 2". Then, when Leonardo seemingly decapitated him in "Return to New York Part 3".

The Journal had mistakenly reported the illness of his cousin James Ross Clemens (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">wasn't actually dead</a>, either) as Twain's own death.

Doctors predicted his wound was fatal, and he was "posthumously" promoted to Brigadier General. Newspapers in his home state of Maine ran obituaries about his supposed death. The doctor's diagnosis turned out to be accurate, but the predicted timing was not. Chamberlain did die from his wound, but not for another 50 years, in 1914. He was the last recorded civil war veteran to die from battle wounds.

</li><li> Happens sporadically to non-notable individuals; usually, this results from poor communication between a family and the funeral home (i.e., a family member incorrectly reporting that someone had died, when in fact that person is still alive although death is likely imminent). On these rare occasions, the funeral home will submit for publication to local newspapers an obituary that had been pre-written.
</li><li> Every major news outfit will have pre-written (or, for broadcast media, pre-edited) obituary notices ready to go for notable figures, particularly those considered at high risk of non-natural death and those old enough that natural death could happen any day now. As can be seen from several of the following examples, it's an unfortunately short step from "ready to go" to "gone out the door without proper verification, better call the Legal department". In addition, Obit packages for very notable figures can sometimes be put up for sale (Pope John Paul II's obituary was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/film/dvd/pope-john-paul-ii-1920-2005/DVDB00096J1LYLN?keyword=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_P3jBRAqEiwAZyWWaE0fsv6_Y-kE5FcF2ViwyTaq3IoGm0zeK9en9cmxOKql6TvcfrO0iBoCYMkQAvD_BwE">released on DVD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for example).

In a subsequent public appearance Jobs joked about the accident by displaying on screen, "The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated." Jobs <em>actually</em> died about three years later.
</li><li> A newspaper mistakenly published an obituary for Alfred Nobel, instead of his deceased brother. Nobel was shocked to see a newspaper crowing that "the merchant of death is dead" due to his invention of dynamite and gun propellants, and was inspired to start the Nobel Prize so that he would be remembered for something else. It worked.

</li><li> In the aftermath of the demonstration on 17th November 1989 that launched the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution">Velvet Revolution</a> in Czechoslovakia, a rumor has spread that a student named Martin míd was killed during the event. This turned to be a misinformation; a student of that name was at the demonstration, but left before the police attack began. He was interviewed on television, presumably to dispel the rumor...and the transmission started at just the wrong moment when he was saying, referring to the events of the day: "Death touched me." (In case this figure of speech doesn't translate well to English, he meant: "I was horrified.")
</li><li> Some accidental premature publishing on cnn.com revealed that CNN at least has outlines and some graphics prepared for obituaries of famous people who have yet to die, like Dick Cheney and Queen Elizabeth, in anticipation of eventually having to get one up on short notice. Notably, the Cheney one was <em>clearly</em> not ready, as it called him "England's favorite grandmother" - a line from Elizabeth's premature obit.

The fact that the 'evidence' for this theory largely seemed to stem from a number of obscure and oblique 'references' on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatles</a> album covers and in song lyrics suggested that large quantities of drugs being ingested probably had something to do with it, but the rumours bedeviled McCartney for years no matter how many times he denied them, including a variation on the Mark Twain 'quote' above: "Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. If I were dead I'd be the last to know."

But I had to record. That's what I'm willing to go through to get the job done."

Vigoda found this amusing, and had a photo published in <em>Variety</em> of himself sitting up in a coffin reading the mistaken issue of <em>People</em>. In 1987, it happened again after a reporter from Secaucus, New Jersey, mistakenly called him "the late Abe Vigoda", which once again prompted much amusement and what spawned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> about Vigoda's "dead or alive" status.

In the 1998 case, where his "death" was actually published on the Associated Press' web site, Hope's death was announced in the U.S. House of Representatives, broadcast live on C-SPAN (with camera shots of visibly upset legislators being shown). The 2003 obituary was published on CNN's website.
</li><li> Country music pioneer Ray Price was also a victim of the premature obituary, as many national news outlets (from <em>Rolling Stone</em> to the <em>USA Today</em>) had reported the singer's purported passing on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2013, from cancer - only for Price's wife, Janie, to reveal that although he was near death, he was still alive. <a class="urllink" href="http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/reports-of-country-legend-ray-prices-death-have-been-premature.html/">See this link for more details.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Incidentally, Price did die - approximately a day after the premature obituaries were announced online,</a> leaving behind one of the greatest legacies ever in country music.

The producer spread the rumor to revive interest.
</li><li> In the Christmas charity livestreams for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast">the Yogscast</a> in 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane">Simon Lane</a> put a photo of fellow member Alex "Parv" Parvis (also the guitarist for the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Area11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Area11">Area 11</a>) onscreen, claimed he'd died and said that the photo was a mini-memorial. It very promptly became a meme in the form of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">RIP PARV</a>", in no small part thanks to people who believed it was true, and he came back from a gig with the band that very evening to <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Area11Parvis/status/407302458290208768">find out he was "dead"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even after he cleared the situation up, there were people who still didn't believe he was still alive nearly seven months later.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane">Simon Lane</a> was a victim of this himself, after some people tried to pretend he had died in order to scam money, under pretences that it would go towards a revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries">Shadow of Israphel</a></em>. Subsequently, his and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley">Lewis Brindley</a>'s joint channel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyTheFandomCantHaveNiceThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyTheFandomCantHaveNiceThings">turned off comments for around two months</a>, since this was the last straw (other comments had been self-promotion of small channels, spamming for reports of SOI, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> complaining unnecessarily and so on).
</li><li> In 2009 actress Nancy Allen was reported to have died of cancer, she later came out and told the public this was untrue.
</li><li> For the longest time, the English voice of Mewtwo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em> (credited as "Philip Bartlett") was believed to have died in 2001. However, in 2014, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13970">the actor himself came out to put an end to all the confusion,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> revealing that he was still alive and that his real name was Jay Goede.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudiDench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudiDench">Judi Dench</a> was the object of a cruel Internet hoax in October 2015. Stories were circulated on the Internet falsely stating she had died. Most credible news reporters checked and refrained from publishing, but the story still circulated virally. Ms Dench herself has since put out an official statement to the effect that she is still, here and hopes to be present in the world for some time yet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAntonWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAntonWilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>. Who in the very early Internet days of 1994 was perplexed when people began phoning and writing to his "widow" to express condolences over her sad loss. Wilson had no idea how the rumour started, but when writing about the metaphysics of being "dead" whilst still being alive, said he really appreciated some of the nicer obituaries that were being printed. Apparently an Internet bulletin board had put it out as a joke to see who was taken in.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, four major Australian broadcasting stations announced the death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Within an hour they realised it would have been better to have confirmed the story, as they were told in no uncertain terms the 93-year old Queen Mum was still alive. it turns out an Australian working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sky">Sky</a> News in London had walked in on a test screening of the QM's obituary, got the wrong end of the stick entirely, and rang home to Brisbane with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingForTheBigScoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingForTheBigScoop">scoop</a></em>. The local radio station put it out, and... quite a few Australians no longer work in broadcast news.
</li><li> Sometime in 2008, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>' website was hacked with a message saying that she was killed by a drunk driver. Presumably, she wasn't impressed. (As of 2017, she's still alive and still doing music.)
</li><li> One of the more famous examples of this trope was the rumor that John Gilchrist, who played <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mikey">the kid from the famous Life Cereal commercial,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died from overexposure from carbon monoxide after eating Pop Rocks with Coke. The rumor was debunked and Gilchrist is still with us as of 2012, working as a director of media sales for MSG Network.
<ul><li> In a similar case, Sven Ruygrok appeared in an infamous commercial for Frosties cereal in the UK, leading to a cyberbullying campaign against him and many rumors on the internet that he had committed suicide because of the bullying. Ruygrok has publicly spoken to confirm he is still alive and give his side of the story.

</li></ul></li><li> In the midst of a celebrity death epidemic in January 2016 that claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman">Alan Rickman</a> among others, someone made a deeply ridiculous article stating that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Animal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Animal">Animal</a> (a fictional character) had died. While the Muppet team has yet to respond to this, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/muppet-animal-death-hoax/">Snopes was quick to debunk the rumor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> See also the fake obituary for the Pillsbury Doughboy, which was more of an excuse to write a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a> sometime in 2013, but it didn't take long for it to be confirmed as a hoax.
</li><li> When Sir George Martin, the longtime producer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, died in March 2016, people confused him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R.

</li><li> When college basketball star Lauren Hill died from cancer in April 2015, a lot of people thought that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees">The Fugees</a> frontwoman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill">Lauryn Hill</a> had passed away. She didnt.
</li><li> A clickbait article titled "These celebrities died without anyone knowing" was highlighted with a picture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferCoolidge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferCoolidge">Jennifer Coolidge</a>. When someone pointed this out to her on Twitter, she responded "Yes, I am dead, and it's great!"
</li><li> The main article page for a while depicted actor Chandler Riggs responding via Twitter to a similar scenario, where a photo of him was captioned with a link to "actors who died quietly this year." His response: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">"I wish LOL"</a>.

The fandom tends to play along with this joke.
</li><li> In a truly tragic and bizarre turn, when popular fan fiction writer "becuzitswrong" (whose collective stories have over half a million subscribers on fanfiction.net) started suffering serious delays in updating because of chronic health problems, a rumor made the rounds that the writer had died. Eventually, he posted an update to several fan fiction archives saying that, no, he was still alive and would be returning to regular updates soon. He even went so far as to quote the line "reports of my death were greatly exaggerated" and said that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">things have finally calmed down and I am starting to write again. It is a wonderful feeling.</a>" Unfortunately, he died for real less than a week after this announcement was posted.
</li><li> Following the 2011 Japanese earthquake, rumours of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiTajiri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiTajiri">Satoshi Tajiri</a> dying as a result spread on the internet. <a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/5781344/pokemon-company-squashes-twitter-rumor-of-creators-death-update">These were proven false within days.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">The Daily Telegraph</a> mistakenly reported the death of folk violinist Dave Swarbrick of the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FairportConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FairportConvention">Fairport Convention</a> in 1999, saying that he had died at home in Coventry. Swarbrick later said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughRoom">It isn't the first time I've died in Coventry.</a>" Swarbrick died for real in 2016.

</li><li> Ugandan anti-death penalty activist Edward Edmary Mpagi spent 18 years in death row for the murder of a businessman named George William Wandyaka. In reality, Wandyaka had been injured during a home robbery, but survived. However, the civil war in Uganda cut communications between Masaka (where the attack took place) and the capital Kampala (where Mpagi was arrested), preventing the correction of the error.
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a>' debut album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LicensedToIll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LicensedToIll">Licensed to Ill</a></em>, was released, rumours started to circulate that Mike D had died from a drug overdose. In response, "Shake Your Rump" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulsBoutique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulsBoutique">Paul's Boutique</a></em> included the following lyrics:
<div class="indent">Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead <br/>Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med
</div></li><li> Mambo musician Pérez Prado (born as Dámaso Pérez Prado) was mistakenly reported dead by newspapers in 1983. In reality, it was his brother Pantaleón Pérez Prado (also a musician, and who also had gone by just Pérez Prado years before) who had passed away.
</li><li> Said word for word by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn">Olivia Newton-John</a>, battling cancer but denying rumors that her time is drawing near.
</li><li> Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius was mistakenly reported dead during an illness in 175 AD; hearing the news, the troops of Syrian-Roman General Avidius Cassius acclaimed him as new emperor in the Middle East, only to murder him three months later when they learned that Marcus Aurelius was very much alive and preparing military action against them. Some suggest Marcus Aurelius's wife, Faustina the Younger, deliberately misled Avidius Cassius as part of a convoluted way to secure the succession of her teenage son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Commodus</a>, and that Marcus Aurelius was aware of this and it was the reason why he ordered Avidius Cassius's correspondence to be destroyed.
</li><li> Model and pin-up legend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettiePage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettiePage">Bettie Page</a> disappeared at the height of her popularity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and was widely believed to have died. Considering her rather wild and self-destructive lifestyle, this was not an unreasonable assumption. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, an investigation into her fate was launched, only to uncover that she was in fact still alive and living in Los Angeles, poor and completely unaware of her iconic status. A horde of fans and admirers (Hugh Hefner not least among them) worked to ensure that she received royalties for reproductions of her work, allowing her to live in relative comfort until her death in 2008. She never returned to the public eye, however, preferring to let her fans remember her as the sex symbol she had been.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> disaster in 1986 three workers were sent into the tunnel beneath the reactor to open a set of sluice gates and drain water tanks that were in danger of exploding and worsening the damage. Given the amount of radiation they would be exposed to it was considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a> and initial reports suggested that all three of them had died of Accute Radiation Sickness afterwards. Whether this was part of the official attempts to cover up the extent of the disaster or simply a result of bureaucratic miscommunication is unknown, but the story that they had died persisted for many years. Eventually it was discovered that all three men had actually survived their trip beneath the reactor. As of 2019 two of them, Alexei Ananenko and Valeri Bezpalov, are still alive while the third, Boris Baranov, died of a heart attack in 2005.
</li><li> In 1855, a human body found under a bridge in Milwaukee was identified positively by ten witnesses as belonging to a gentleman called John Dwire. During the inquest, Mr Dwire, who had been living 16 miles away at Kemper's Pier, declared on oath, "Lest anyone here should still think I'm dead, I have come in person to assure him that I am not the corpse found in the river last Saturday morning". The true identity of the corpse was never discovered.
</li><li> In 1989, during the making of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a> music video for "Down In It", a weather balloon holding up a camera being used for filming ended up floating away and the crewmembers were unable to recover it. The balloon traveled 200 miles, where it landed in a field in Michigan and found by a farmer. After the camera was handed over to the police, they saw footage of what they believed to be the decayed corpse of an unknown man surrounded by two men in what they thought was a gang killing. The footage was then sent to the FBI, where after a year of investigation the truth was discovered: the 'decayed corpse' was actually NIN frontman Trent Reznor covered in cornstarch to <em>appear</em> dead and decayed for the purpose of the music video, and the other two men were then-members Chris Vrenna and Richard Patrick. Reznor, who as of 2020 is still alive, found the whole ordeal amusing.
</li><li> "Predictions for the Year 1708", a satire of astrolgy written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift">Jonathan Swift</a> under the name "Isaac Bickerstaff", predicted the death of astrologer and almanac-writer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Partridge_(astrologer)">John Partridge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who had annoyed Swift with a comment about the "infallible" Church of England (effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">equating</a> it with the Roman Catholic Church). On the predicted date, a letter circulated "confirming" Partridge's death and giving him a sarcastic eulogy. Partridge had recurring difficulties convincing people that he was in fact still alive until he finally died for real a few years later.
</li><li> Donald O'Brien, an actor who starred in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Westerns</a> and Italian horror films in the 1960s and 1970s, was falsely reported to have died on November 29, 2003; a misconception that's still reflected in many online sources. It didn't help that he'd had health problems since the 80s and gone into retirement in the 90s. As of 2016 he was still very much alive and living Paris, and apparently finds the entire situation very amusing.
</li><li> Death of French politician and businessman <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Tapie">Bernard Tapie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has been erroneously announced several times. In one of those (October 2019), French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> mistakenly published online a pre-written eulogy, and the mistake was obvious since crucial information like date or age of death were left blank; cause of death was cancer, and Tapie (who is still alive in 2020) is indeed suffering from cancer.
