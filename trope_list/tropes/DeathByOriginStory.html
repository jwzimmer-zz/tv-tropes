</p><p>Sure, bringing them back is always possible and could take the story in exciting new directions, and deeply change the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a> when his dead little sister returns... or it just might be in bad taste, get poorly handled, nullify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingWidower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingWidower">their motivation</a> and lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningACanOfClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningACanOfClones">they were really</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplicantSnatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplicantSnatching">robot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Shapeshifting</a> Alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clone</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">ninja</a>" and promptly getting killed or forgotten.

When the loved ones aren't specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">murdered by a villain</a>, their deaths are often due to something common and/or vague such as a car accident or some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiseaseThatShallNotBeNamed">disease that shall not be named</a>. The cause of death can also start out very vaguely and then clarify (often disastrously) as the story progresses.
</p><p>A variation of Death by Origin Story occurs when the important death is the main protagonist's <em>own</em> death, as important part of his or her <em>own</em> origin story. Usually, this involves a transition to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">undead</a> state of some sort, or alternatively, the character dies but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">resurrected</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">a new form</a> and granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToGiveACharacterSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToGiveACharacterSuperpowers">superpowers</a>.

Whether this means the role is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a> deal is yet unresolved.
</li><li> This was one of the reasons that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a> (Barry Allen) stayed dead once his former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a> Wally West came into his own as his successor. That's been undone now, though.
<ul><li> A pivotal story in the early '90s played with this by having Barry seem to return leaving Wally happy about Barry's return but conflicted about being back in his shadow (particularly since his speed had been reduced at the same point when Barry died leaving him the slower and less competent Flash). He had to deal with these issues in order to defeat Barry when he turned out to be Professor Zoom.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>:
<ul><li> Alan Scott forged his ring after his proximity to the Starheart during a catastrophic train crash caused by sabotage saved his life, but killed his friend/lover (depending on continuity) Jimmy Henton who had just been warning him that his business rival Albert Dekker wasn't going to take being outbid lying down.
</li><li> Abin Sur's impending death on Earth led the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> ring to choose its first human bearer (not counting Alan Scott, whose ring is of a different origin.) He's managed to stay dead and his death has even given Hal Jordan the nemesis <em>Amon</em> Sur, who blamed Hal for his father's death.
</li></ul></li><li> Particularly nasty variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash">Hack/Slash</a></em>, in which Cassie Hack's origin story involves having to kill her own psychotic and undead mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIntimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIntimates">The Intimates</a></em> only offhandedly mentions it, but Punchy first donned his costume shortly after his older sister was murdered.
</li><li> Ho Yinsen, the man who helped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> escape capture and build his first suit of armor. The identity of the people who capture Tony and force him to build them weapons varies depending on the medium, but regardless of the exact telling of Iron Man's origins, Yinsen is always there to a) help Tony build his armor and escape, b) act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a>, and c) die.
</li><li> This is mentioned by the second Jailbait in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable">Incorruptable</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><em>My parents are dead and I just put on this costume because apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">I just had a superhero origin</a>, okay?!</em>
</div></li><li> Parodied in <em>Kill All Parents</em>, where a scientist discovers that dead parents somehow directly guarantees their kid will become an awesome superhero. This leads to a government project dedicated to randomly murdering couples with children (and in one case an entire alien planet) to ensure that a generation of heroes will exist to save them from a foretold catastrophe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> has what is arguably the most extreme example of this ever. Most of his <em>species</em>, including his <em>wife and daughter</em>, spontaneously combusted after contracting a psychic plague engineered by his <em>own brother</em>. J'onn only survived by severing his own psychic connection to the rest of his people, meaning he had to watch his family die in front of him while he was mentally cut off from them. The worst thing is that he could have stopped all of this. He knew his brother was up to no good, but J'onn still had misplaced trust in him and underestimated the depths of his evil. The loss of his people and his family in particular are a huge part of his character, which might be why attempts to revive his race always turn out to be fakeouts. While there is another (evil) Green Martian out there, his family is still dead.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MisterTerrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MisterTerrific">Mister Terrific</a>'s older brother and wife die, leading to him taking up the mantle of the original.
</li><li> Eve Eden was driven to master her powers and become the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightshade">Nightshade</a> by her mother's murder and brother's abduction.
</li><li> James-Michael's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaTheUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaTheUnknown">Omega the Unknown</a></em>, combined with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal">Robotic Reveal</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">The Power of Shazam!</a></em> Annual #1, CeCe Beck's parents are killed by the Aberrant terrorist Dash Noir. In the confusion, a magic weapon sends Beck to the Rock of Eternity where she meets Captain Marvel and becomes his successor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> watched his whole family get caught in a mafia cross-fire, leading him to kill as many criminals as he could find.
<ul><li> And then, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse">an alternate-universe story</a> where Frank Castle's family were killed during an alien invasion, he blamed the X-Men and Avengers and went on to hunt down meta-humans. It didn't help that the superheroes weren't very willing to accept responsibility for the deaths that their superfight caused, though Castle's actions in this What If comic were portrayed as nothing less than extreme.
</li><li> Marvel supervillain crimelord, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheHood">The Hood</a>, magically resurrected Frank Castle's wife and kids during Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a></em>, in an attempt to bribe him to leave him alone. Frank is unable to accept that they're the real deal <em>and burns them alive</em> (using the corpse of another briefly-resurrected supervillain who he just killed). Even the Hood (who still gives support to his own ex-wife and kids) was thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">shocked.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RelativeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RelativeHeroes">Relative Heroes</a></em> parodied this; the main characters, who recently discovered their superpowers, decide that the death of their parents means they're destined to be superheroes.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, where Victor's mother was killed by his father as a punishment for failing to prevent Victor's powers from emerging ahead of schedule. While this drives him to join the Runaways and become a hero, he is supposedly fated to eventually become the supervillain Victorious.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Spider-Man</em>'s defining tragedy was the very preventable death of his Uncle Ben, who died at the hands of a man who Peter purposefully refused to help the police stop earlier that day.
<ul><li> To a much lesser extent, Peter Parker's biological parents, as he was introduced as an orphan being raised by his aunt and uncle. Most comic writers and adaptations tend to treat them as a non-factor in Peter's life, with readers knowing nothing about Richard and Mary until a 1968 annual during the Lee/Romita run. Later, there was a story arc in which the two were "brought back", but unsurprisingly, the "returned" parents were revealed to be robots.
</li></ul></li><li> In the alternate universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em>, Gwen Stacy got spider powers instead of her best friend and neighbor Peter Parker, becoming Spider-Woman. Like main universe Peter Parker, she initially begins her career by fooling around with her powers. Meanwhile Peter, finally fed up with being bullied and admiring Spider-Woman, ends up turning himself into the Lizard and goes on an uncontrollable rampage. Gwen, not knowing that her best friend was the monster, not only fought the beast but purposely prolonged the fight for fun, only for Peter to revert to normal and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie">die in her arms from the injuries</a>. This causes her to take her role as a superhero more seriously.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> supporting character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Toxin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Toxin">Toxin</a> plays around with this a little: Toxin's already an established hero when Razorfist kills his father, and by the end of the series Toxin sees Razorfist put behind bars.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman">Starman</a></em>. David Knight dies in the first issue after doing nothing of note (apart from fighting the Will Payton Starman), but Jack takes an entire story arc before taking up the mantle. David becomes more interesting after his death, popping up in the annual "Talking With David" stories and even getting his own story arc at the close of the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> may or may not play this straight, depending on the continuity. Kal-El's biological parents died, of course, when Krypton blew up.<em>Clark Kent's</em> parents, the Kents, are a different story...
<ul><li> Originally, pre-Crisis, both Pa and Ma Kent died when Clark was a child, marking the passage between Superboy and Superman.
</li><li> Post-Crisis, both Ma and Pa Kent lived to see their son become Superman and marry Lois Lane, and acted as supporting characters. Pa Kent would later die, but by that point, Clark had been Superman for a long time and it wasn't tied to his origin.
</li><li> Post-Flashpoint, Clark's parents die in a car crash involving a drunk driver when he's a child. This, combined with the lack of known superheroes, removes much of Clark's optimism and makes him a broodier character. It's later revealed that this was all planned by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doctor Manhattan</span>, in an experiment regarding Superman, and that the aim was to make him broodier and darker. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DCRebirth</a>, they have been put back, alive and well.
<ul><li> Another change later revealed is that, while Clark initially believed his kryptonian parents to have died on Krypton, his father Jor-El survived thanks to the intervention of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the aforementioned Doctor Manhattan</span>. He watches Clark grow from the shadows, and would re-enter his son's life once Clark had become Superman, as the villainous Mr. Oz.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Subverted and played straight with Rorschach in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>. When his mother died all he said was "Good". But it was the event when Kitty Genovese was killed and despite multiple people hearing and seeing this event did nothing did he decide to become a vigilante.
</li><li> "The Wombat" in <em>10th Muse</em> murdered her <em>own</em> parents outside a movie theater after arranging for them to see a showing of <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> in an attempt to invoke the trope and make her a stronger hero.
<ul><li> This storyline was later remade with a few major alterations in <em>Insane Jane</em> - Jane kills everyone she knows so she can have a proper "origin", but she's schizophrenic and doesn't actually know she's doing it.
</li></ul></li><li> A few other Marvel stories that involved this trope, for example:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a>'s debut and origin story involved the murders of Hank Pym's first wife Maria and of Janet Van Dyne's father as motivations for Hank's attraction for Janet and Janet's decision to become a superhero. Before you ask, yes a separate story does exist about Hank Pym's decision of becoming a superhero to find/save Maria. And as of 2016 yet another story about Maria giving birth before being murdered which resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UnstoppableWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UnstoppableWasp">Nadia Pym</a>, who became a superhero in her memory and to find her lost family. This must be some kind of a record.
<ul><li> This gets spoofed during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a>, when the Avengers meet Janet's still-very-much-alive father, who begins explaining Janet's origins, and the Avengers interrupt, assuming she did it to avenge the death of her mother. A flustered Dr. Van Dyne informs them his wife is actually still alive at that very moment.
</li></ul></li><li> T'Challa became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> after his father was killed by Ulysses Klaw.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> #1 introduced Matt Murdock as a half-orphan, then his father was murdered on the orders of the Fixer. Frank Miller's retcon later revealed that Matt Murdock's mother had not died but become a nun, while the origin of Miller's new character, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">aptly named Elektra</a> also entailed the death of her father.
</li><li> Professor X of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> was shown as having lost his biological parents as well as his step-father in his origin story. Cyclops was introduced as an orphan (although it was later revealed that at least his father survived long enough to meet his children again).
<ul><li> Professor X's origin (which spans several decades prior to his debut) also has him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">paralyzed from waist down</a>. Even though he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningGambit">no longer in his original body</a>, the notion of one of the most powerful men alive being confined to a wheelchair is so intrinsic to Xavier's character that restoration of his ability to walk never lasts long.
</li></ul></li><li> Loki's <em>Tales of Asgard</em> origin story showed him as the orphaned son of one of Odin's late enemies.
<ul><li> In a roundabout way, Loki manages to be his <em>own</em> death by origin story. See, during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Siege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Siege">Siege</a></em>, Loki gets torn in half by The Void. Having figured he would die at some point, Loki had already prepared a resurrection scheme, only it goes a little wrong, and a new Loki is born with absolutely none of the old Loki's memories (and more importantly, none of the evil), considered by the universe to be his own individual.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>'s young daughter died in a fire while a mob tried to kill her father for his newly emerged mutant abilities.
</li><li> Another <em>X-Men</em> example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a>, who's actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonist</a> of her own origin book, which focuses instead on her mother and creator, Sarah Kinney, her attempts to clone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, and her subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> to save the girl. And then she's killed at the end as a final posthumous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> by Zander Rice, just as she helps X-23 escape.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>'s mutant power first awakened when her best friend Annie Robinson got hit by a car one day. Jean peered into Annie's mind during her dying moments, and the experience left her traumatized. She became withdrawn from constantly hearing other people's thoughts, and it took the teachings of Professor X to find her true calling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin">Original Sin</a></em> revealed an untold chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a>'s life: during his CIA days, he was on the losing edge of a battle against invading aliens in Kansas when Woody McCord turned the tide against them, dying from a fatal injury afterwards. Howard Stark, who had been McCord's partner, told Fury about how McCord had been defending the planet from anyone and anything that threatens it, and Fury agreed to continue his legacy in secret.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>'s mother was killed in the same accident that injured him to the point that his father had to fit him with bionics to save his life.

</li><li> You quest with Draka and Durotan throughout Frostfire Ridge, and after you finish the zone you can see both of them in your garrison. Thrall even comments that Durotan is "like a father" to him. Although it could be argued that THIS Durotan and Draka are not his parents because it's an alternate universe.

In fact, there was a military service (implied to be of the commando/special forces type) for "hopeless" characters with sub-par ability scores designed to either kill them off or give them significant rewards to compensate for their deficiencies.

Of course, that didn't quite go as planned, and only proved that Scorpion probably shouldn't have wound up in Hell to begin with.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MortalKombatLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MortalKombatLegacy">Mortal Kombat: Legacy</a></em> reveals that sorcerer Quan Chi impersonated Bi Han (AKA Sub-Zero) and, along with Shang Tsung, set the whole thing up in order to trick General Hanzo Hasashi (AKA Scorpion) to join the Netherrealm in Mortal Kombat. Quan Chi even mentions that the desire for revenge will blind Scorpion (no pun intended) to any inconsistencies.

</li><li> A popular fan theory surrounding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> is that the titular character's half-human and half-ghost nature is a result of the power-granting lab accident actually killing and resurrecting him, rather than his DNA simply being suffused with ectoplasm.
</li><li> Rose Quartz of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> ceased to be as part of bringing her son, the protagonist Steven into the world. Whether the word "die" applies or not is questionable, given that it has been all but stated that she has literally become a part of him due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAlien">Starfish Alien</a> biology and a jerry-rigged set of reproductive organs, but that merely shifts her from "real death by origin story" to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality">Death of Personality</a> by Origin Story".
