Is this turning into one of those shows where we sit around and reminisce, thereby recouping eighty percent of the episode cost, via the use of clips and archive footage? <br/><strong>Sam:</strong> Yes it is, Max. Now stop talking, stupid, it's costing money.
<div class="indent">— <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSamAndMaxFreelancePolice">The Adventures of Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">The Final Episode</a>"
</div></div><p>An episode which consists mainly of fragments (clips) of previous episodes. Usually has a theme: for example, to highlight a character's development over the years, or show the relationship between characters. Sometimes, however, it won't be shown that the events take place in the past, but they are shown as appearing directly one after another.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Clip shows can be used to stretch the budget — they utilize footage already shot, thus needing only narrative glue money for the episode. In that sense, they are similar to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">Bottle Episode</a>. They can also be used to stretch the <em>story</em> — when a show's episode order is suddenly expanded after its early episodes prove popular, but the writers don't have enough story to fill quite that many episodes, clip shows are a popular recourse.
</p><p>Sometimes regular episodes <em>turn into</em> clip shows when they are localized for other markets, as it's simple and inexpensive to edit in recap segments made up of clips from prior episodes to replace the gaps made when nudity and other risqué content is deleted. (Occasionally this can even happen before an episode is aired in the <em>original</em> market, as was the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>'s infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a>.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>One place you might see a clip show is in the second-to-last episode of a season; it's used to conserve the last of the season's budget, so they can blow the wad on a kickass finale.
</p><p>When a clip show is used to sum up a season or storyline, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a>.
</p><p>Clip shows were more appreciated by viewers in the days before reruns, syndication, and videotapes/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVDs</a> provided an alternative way for them to revisit the old moments of their shows. There were even theatrical films that served as these, most famously the <em>That's Entertainment!</em> films in the 1970s. In those days, they were less likely to get today's cynical reaction, "They've just done it to save money." They still occasionally emerge in today's TV productions, though mainly in children's programming. In the rare occasion where they manifest in adult scripted programming (such as occurred with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>) they are usually built into an ongoing story arc. Otherwise, bottle shows are more likely to be produced these days. Due to their low popularity, clip shows are practically more parodied than played straight these days—a very common choice is to have a clip show setup, only for the actual clips to be from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">stories and events we never actually saw</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">be comically off from the ones we did see</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A variant on the clip show are the recap or catch-up specials that often precede new-season premieres for arc-heavy series that serve to help new and returning viewers understand the storyline so far. Shows that have done these sorts of specials in recent years (they are rarely considered regular episodes) have included <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> (several), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>. Often, these specials are documentaries, with narration or on-screen introductions by cast members; occasionally, however, the actors appear in character (or, as occurred with the <em>Farscape: Undressed</em>, there was a mixture of both).
</p><p>When previous clips of a single character's line or action are played out in rapid succession (such as Homer's "D'oh" sequence in <em>So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show</em>), that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow">Fully Automatic Clip Show</a>.
</p><p>Compare this to the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSecurityCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSecurityCam">Magical Security Cam</a>. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverClipShow">Voiceover Clip Show</a>, which is simply a cheap/lazy way of making factual entertainment shows.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> has an unusually high number of these. Episodes 29, 66 and 102 are all recaps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Macross</a></em> segment featured two clip show episodes adapted directly from the Japanese series, which had to use clip shows to fill space after its order was suddenly expanded from 23 to 36 episodes early in the season. One episode had an expertly edited dream sequence episode formed mainly of clips, with new dialogue, which flowed into each other in a very accurate rendition of dream logic. The other was the episode "Gloval's Report," which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Captain Gloval reporting the major milestones of the series thus far to his superiors. ("Gloval's Report" was also expanded into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a>, <em>Codename: Robotech</em>, for broadcast to build interest in advance of the show beginning its syndication run.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada">New Generation</a></em> episode called "Sandstorm" is another clip show adapted directly from the original series. Another <em>New Generation</em> episode gained a several-minute recap segment at the beginning when several minutes of nudity were deleted from the original series's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a>.
</li><li> Another clip show was the episode that linked the <em>Macross</em> segment to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Robotech Masters</a></em> segment. This episode was created entirely from other episodes' content by the American translation company, which needed to fill an episode's worth of space to pad the count out to a divisible-by-five number to better fit into weekday syndication.
</li></ul></li><li> Around the middle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers: Energon</a></em>, there was a mostly clip episode for no particular reason.
</li><li> Ditto for the original series (at least the dub) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em> took that episode and ran with it. All the lines (except the flashback to the <em>opening credits</em>) were new.
<ul><li> The parody is immediately lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">The Paradox Brothers</a>:

</div><ul><li> That episode was in the original Japanese version as well. There were also two others: episodes 144 and 184. 144 took place in between the Battle City and anime-only Doma arcs that had Tea (Anzu) and Serenity (Shizuka) reminiscing about the events of the Battle City Tournament as well as when Noah took them hostage. Episode 184 ended the Doma storyline, but actually spent most of it having the characters in the arc remember what happened in the past 40 episodes.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Did I just abridge my own series?</strong>
</div><ul><li> Hell, spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVrains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVrains">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em> takes this to offensive levels.

And keep in mind Season One has 46 episodes total. By skipping all episodes between the ones dedicated exclusively to Clip Shows, you can watch the whole season one in 12 episodes, and you'd arguably not miss anything.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Another famous example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">plays with this trope</a> by using its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gekiganger3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gekiganger3">Gekiganger 3</a></em> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> — with the <em>Gekiganger </em>characters watching the episode as their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> (Within A Show... my puzzler hurts). The <em>Gekiganger</em> characters freely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hang a lampshade</a> on this trope. And just to completely demolish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a>, the second half of the episode reveals that <em>Gekiganger</em>'s trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon">Forgotten Superweapon</a>, the Gekigan Flare, was inspired by <em>Nadesico</em>. Which has already had its hero come up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> based on <em>Gekiganger</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> held out for eight years before creating a clip show — a mash of scenes from the current arc's important battles that wasn't even edited to make the music flow. The dub just skipped it, and its three later successors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>:
<ul><li> The last episode of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> was a clip show narrated by the as-yet-unrevealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> And the last episode of the second arc was a joke clip show about a secondary character. And the last episode of the third arc was a clip show interspersed with a narration by the main character revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she slept with Akio.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> uses this a few times during the show's run. 3 episodes out of 50 are clip shows. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> has even more. Some are really annoying. Episode 29 is a decent example of how to do one of these right.
</li><li> Episodes 15-18 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em>. It seems several months passed after episode 14, so it was deemed necessary to recap pretty much the whole thing (that or a low budget). On the American DVDs, the four episodes filled an entire volume (vol. 4: "recollections"). It retails for $30, and the average rating on Amazon is one and a half stars (as opposed to five stars for vol. 3).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> series <em>Car Robots</em> has three clip shows; when it was dubbed into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em> those episodes remained clip shows, but the clips involved were completely different. In at least one case this was probably an attempt to show scenes that hadn't aired because the episode was released after 9/11.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory">Transformers Victory</a></em> had no less than six over the course of its run, with another four added for the video release.

There were several episodes that were nothing but clip shows, including one notorious incident where <strong>five episodes in a row were just clip shows.</strong> Fully half of the penultimate episode was a recap clip show of the antepenultimate episode.

</li><li> <em>Naruto Shippuden</em> gave us a double-length clip show with episodes 212 and 213. A handful of plot developments were thrown in between the flashbacks, but the two episodes had barely 10 minutes of new footage between them.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em> had a clip show that actually lasted one and 1/2 episodes of its 26 episode run.

</li><li> A notable one happened in episode 89 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>. It featured only voiceovers of the five main senshi discussing the events of the season and pondering the future while clips from the entire series played out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> had a clip show in 1993 as a year-end special, where Goku (who is at that point deceased) decides to visit Earth to spend New Years with his family, and they reminisce about everything that happened in the anime that year, mainly the Cell Games and the Otherworld Tournament. This was never aired outside of Japan.
</li><li> In the primary show content, the idea was played with a little. For filler the anime would often have scenes taking place away from the action where characters would reminisce about events from both DBZ and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and could range anywhere from five to ten minutes. For example, late during the Goku/Freeza fight after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone else gets teleported back to Earth by Porunga</span> there's an episode that devotes a little bit of time to have Piccolo think back on his past with Goku, which then features clips of mainly from the Piccolo storylines from Dragon Ball. Another episode has Master Roshi explain the history of the Red Ribbon Army to some of the supporting cast hanging out on his island early on during the Android saga, which in turn features clips from the entire Red Ribbon Army arc from the original Dragon Ball. Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">length of the series</a>, those flashbacks were probably included because the people making the anime thought people legitimately wouldn't remember (or wouldn't even have seen) stuff that was important to a new plot. They became particularly important when the show was exported to America, because everything past the first 13 episodes of <em>Dragon Ball</em> weren't dubbed until later.
</li><li> In Japan, there was the "Summer Vacation" Special that played with the trope by applying it to the movies: Goku, Gohan and friends are dressing up for the 1992 premiere of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZSuperAndroidThirteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZSuperAndroidThirteen">Dragon Ball Z Super Android Thirteen</a></em>, and spend their time reminiscing about all six previous DBZ movies and the three <em>Dragon Ball</em> movies before them.
</li></ul></li><li> The first half of episode 12 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> episode. The episode does add to the plot, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MiamiGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MiamiGuns">Miami Guns</a></em> did a clip show for its <em>second</em> episode, though in this case it was entirely new content with no flashbacks to the first episode. It also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">broke the fourth wall</a> inconsistently, with the lead characters sometimes talking about behind the scenes stuff like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">Animated Actors</a> and sometimes treating the clips as the actual events of their lives.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLiveSunshine">Love Live!

<ul><li> 1974's <em>That's Entertainment!</em> is a collection of highlights from MGM musicals, hosted by performers who had appeared in those films. Released as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebration</a> for MGM's 50th anniversary, it was a surprise box-office hit. There would be two follow-ups: 1976's <em>Part 2</em> included scenes from musicals and non-musicals, and 1993's <em>Part III</em> included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScenes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScenes">Deleted Scenes</a> and rehearsal/test footage from musicals along with finished scenes. The 1985 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em>That's Dancing!</em> didn't restrict itself to MGM movies. On top of all this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">several variations</a> were made well into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, such as:
<ul><li> <em>America at the Movies</em> (A tie-in to the U.S. Bicentennial)
</li><li> <em>It's Showtime</em> (Animals on film)
</li><li> <em>It Came from Hollywood</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B Movies</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>)
</li><li> <em>Terror in the Aisles</em> (Thriller and horror films)

The first half of the film uses then-unseen deleted scenes of Sellers as Inspector Clouseau from the series' 5th film (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPantherStrikesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPantherStrikesAgain">The Pink Panther Strikes Again</a></em>) with new material filmed with the other actors to change the context and create a new storyline. When Clouseau goes missing at about the halfway mark, a reporter interviews people who knew him, triggering flashbacks to previously-seen clips from all of Sellers' previous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther">The Pink Panther</a></em> films. The poor taste of the exercise led to a successful lawsuit by Sellers' widow against the studio and director/writer/producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeEdwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeEdwards">Blake Edwards</a>.
</li><li> The 1943 musical short <em>Three Cheers for the Girls</em> is based on clips from 1930s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> movie musicals, mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber">Busby Berkeley Numbers</a>.

Hope you really liked those previous films! It's perhaps only bested by 1980's even lazier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraSuperMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraSuperMonster">Uchu Kaijū Gamera</a></em>, which was the last entry in the series until <strong>1995.</strong>
</li><li> One or two entries in the <em>Guinea Pig</em> series of gore films.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondo">Mondo</a> film series will do this, an example being <em>The Worst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FacesOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FacesOfDeath">Faces of Death</a></em>.
</li><li> When Double Helix Films went bankrupt in 1992, their last effort <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCampIVTheSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCampIVTheSurvivor">Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor</a></em> was left unfinished. The film finally saw a release in 2012 when a fan of the series edited the shot footage together with 35 minutes worth of clips from the three previous films.
</li><li> Half of the running time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2">Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2</a></em> makes an extensive use of the clips from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNight">the previous movie</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllMonstersAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllMonstersAttack">All Monsters Attack</a>,</em> also known as <em>Godzilla's Revenge,</em> uses a framing story of a kid daydreaming about Godzilla in order to present...footage of Godzilla taken from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EbirahHorrorOfTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EbirahHorrorOfTheDeep">previous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfGodzilla">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters">movies</a>. There are a <em>few</em> new monster scenes, but the majority of the film's (very brief) runtime is made up of pre-existing footage sloppily edited together. The funniest part is that each of the films the stock footage is pulled from used a different Godzilla suit, causing his appearance to change dramatically from scene to scene.

<ul><li> Generally of dubious quality, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em>'s "Unconquerable Man" proved a deft use of the mechanism, changing the context of every clip.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>: the episode "Curtain Call" has several of the main characters remember scenes from previous episodes.

Yemana), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller">Barney Miller</a></em> aired a tribute in the form of a clip show, with the actors breaking character and recalling their favorite Yemana scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: <em>iBloop</em> is a clip show of bloopers, which makes it easier to digest than a normal clip show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus">Big Wolf on Campus</a></em> did this twice.

The second time was during the Third Season finale in which the ACTORS presented clips of the fans' favorite moments as well as clips of their favorite villains.
</li><li> Happens several times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>. The first and most innovative clip show was season 5's "Cat House", which has Piper cast a spell before recounting (with her hubby, Leo) many memories to a shrink... which has the side effect of putting Phoebe and Paige into scenes of those memories (although some of the memories have been tweaked to excise Prue... Phoebe sort of hangs a lampshade on how Paige replaced Prue by noting, "You wanted to meet Prue," while they're in a memory featuring her as a wolf). Other clip shows include "Crimes and Witch Demeanors, "Someone To Witch Over Me" and "Generation Hex".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> episode "Lab Rats" served as both a Clip Show and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a> for the Miniature Killer arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs">Dinosaurs</a></em> did two clip shows, both having the framing device of a modern-day paleontologist making conclusions about dinosaur society that are shown to be completely wrong by the interspersed clips.
</li><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></em> where the title characters go on "Dr. Phyllis"'s talk show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em> ended its second season with a clip show. Until the show was resurrected that fall, it also served as the series finale, to the annoyance of fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em> did this partially in its 100th episode, where Barry and Nora <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a>)</span> have to go back in time to collect the parts for a gadget to defeat Cicada. They travel back to pivotal moments in the show, such as the defeat of Savitar and the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalParticleAccelerator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalParticleAccelerator">particle accelerator explosion</a>. These clips are interspersed with new footage of them interacting with the past.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> is the master of the clip show.
<ul><li> The first one was in Season 4, episode 21, where Ross's decision whether or not to invite Rachel and her decision whether or not to attend are accompanied by flashbacks of every memorable scene in their relationship over four seasons. There are about a total of four new scenes, period, including the two bookends.
</li><li> Subverted in "The One Where Everyone Turns 30" which showed clips of what the gang did when they each turned 30, which was all new footage.
</li><li> "The One With Christmas in Tulsa" in Series 9 played with this: <em>half</em> of the episode was a clip show, but the rest was new footage, and contained a <em>very</em> plot-relevant development. Namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chandler quitting his job.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Many shows have a clip show as their series finale:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> used Michelle getting amnesia from a fall from a horse as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> for the second half of the two-part finale "Michelle Rides Again". This was the only all-out clip show of the series, but several other episodes did have short montages looking back on certain characters' pasts to prove a point in the present, such as Jesse's less-than-stellar musical gigs in Part One of "Captain Video".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a></em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em> did it, pioneering not only many clip shows to come but setting an early precedent for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">series finales</a> altogether.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> aired a 70-minute retrospective on the series immediately preceding the finale, which mostly took the form of clips from previous episodes. The final episode itself also heavily featured clips and callbacks to previous episodes. Consequently, it was infamously poorly received.
</li><li> Each of the four series of ''SClub'' ends this way... which was very annoying as they often used clips used in previous series finale clip shows. Though, given that the rest of the series finales revolved around being as depressing as possible, it may not have been such a bad thing. They also did this when Paul left, if I recall correctly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StuckInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StuckInTheMiddle">Stuck in the Middle</a></em>: "Stuck in the Diaz Awards" is basically a clip show of moments from the past two seasons as the Diaz family celebrates their annual award show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> had a clip show centering around Jack McGee talking to his new boss, trying to justify his continued pursuit of the Hulk.
<ul><li> Another episode, "Interview with the Hulk," another reporter manages to get an interview with David Banner and several clips are shown during the story.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel">Kenan &amp; Kel</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade-hung</a> clip show, with Kenan explaining how the concept worked: "All you have to do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackStares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackStares">stare into the distance</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEffects">everything gets all blurry</a>."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita">La Femme Nikita</a></em> had a clip show episode - "Down a Crooked Path" - where all the regular cast were ordered to visit a memory recording/wiping machine (because of reasons). Most of their memories were about Nikita, which helped to disguise that she did not appear in any of the new footage that week.
</li><li> Because of the massive number of storylines running at any given time and the fact that networks have moved away from actually airing reruns for long-running serialized shows, ABC produced a good number of clip-shows for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em>, usually airing them whenever the show's new season started or after a brief hiatus between new episodes during the season. The purpose of these clip shows was to get returning fans up to speed with the plotlines or in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, to clarify plot-points for viewers.
<ul><li> Ironically, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>'s clip shows have yet to show up in syndication, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em> clip shows HAVE.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver (1985)</a></em> did at least three: "Friends", "Unfinished Business" and "Hindsight".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryHunters">Mystery Hunters</a></em>: The first and second season finales "The Best of Mystery Hunters" has the team discussing their favorite moments from the mysteries, alongside some bloopers.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em> has quite a number of clip shows. Of course, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a>, and seeing as these clips usually involved aliens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> or a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">end of the world,</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">framing devices</a> were slightly above average in uniqueness (they even had the near-obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding">Cruel Twist Ending</a>); but they were still clip shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>
<ul><li> An unusual example occurs in the third act of the episode "Daphne Returns"; over the course of the episode, Niles and Daphne have been experiencing difficulties in their relationship, and in an effort to help, Frasier talks Niles through some of the significant moments in their relationship (their first meeting, their first dance, etc) — however, both the current Frasier and Niles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback">inserted into the scenes with their past selves</a>, thus allowing the characters (and audience) to view the scenes in question from different perspectives. Not only are the clips worked into the episode in a logical and interesting fashion, but they only appear towards the end.
</li><li> "Crock Tales" also subverted the trope, in which new scenes depicting the cast in previous seasons were shot, with the cast recreating their mannerisms, and in some cases, wearing wigs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> tends to play it straight with its seasonal clip shows, generally either as a form of recap or an attempt by the Rangers to piece together several past clues they originally missed to try and figure out what the enemy is really planning.

</li><li> Of particular note is the 500th episode, "Legacy of Power", in which the incumbent team (<em>Dino Thunder</em>) is caught up on the entire history of the Power Rangers in a series of archived videos narrated by Tommy Oliver. <em>Dino Thunder</em> later had its own clip show, "A Test of Trust", after an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal">Internal Reveal</a> shook the team up a bit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em> had two in its first year, both as holiday specials. The Halloween one consisted of previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monsters of the Week</a> retelling their past battles against the heroes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> has done several clip shows:
<ul><li> The "Buster Special" blends several clips of Buster getting trashed with footage of the rebuild.
</li><li> The "Outtakes Special" is just what it says — clips that didn't make it into the show.
</li><li> One could argue that "MythBusters Revealed" qualifies as well, with clips mixed with interviews with the team.
</li><li> During the first season(s), several myths with similar themes (explosions, animals, etc.) were combined into one episode, while sacrificing some of the "filler" material from the original segments.
</li><li> As part of Discovery Channel's 25th anniversary celebration, MythBusters did a two-hour "Top 25 Moments" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> special.
</li><li> One "Shark Week" special was a collection of shark-themed clips.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueenOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueenOfSwords">Queen of Swords</a></em>: "End of Days", with the standard-issue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInARoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInARoom">Locked in a Room</a> framing device. And quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a>, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em> does this three times. One episode uses a framing device of the gang hanging around the Max reminiscing about various scenes/episodes related to dating and romance. Another has Mr. Belding with a group of students from a class many years in the future, watching a video time capsule made by the "present" group of kids. The last has the gang at Zack's house remembering the wacky hijinks of their summer working at the beach club (the 8-episode summer season).
</li><li> A very unusual variant is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> episode "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu", in which, after J.D. comments that at this stage of his career it seems like everything's happened before, much of the rest of the storyline consists of <em>re-recorded</em> scenes from earlier episodes. Scrubs also did a regular clip show in season 6 — really more of a montage show, with sequences of "people dancing", "people falling over", etc. The season six clip show is notable for its lampshade hanging and self-mockery. Fans in aggregate have rated it the series's worst episode.
<ul><li> The funny thing is that in the re-recorded scenes of "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu", there are minor differences in the dialogue, such as the Janitor claiming to have been from Yale instead of Harvard. The entire point of the episode is that while things can repeat themselves, it's the little differences that matter.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow">Fully Automatic Clip Show</a> in season six is sometimes credited as showing the writers what Scrubs used to be about - after a long decline in episode quality, the clip show is followed by some very strong episodes, both in drama and in comedy. The first episode broadcast afterwards has a rant by Dr. Cox in which he accurately describes why and how each other major character is funny, and soon after it would have a very dramatic two-parter, the second episode of which won a Humanitas prize, which the series hadn't won since its first season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Clipshow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Clipshow">clipshows</a>, usually in the context of one of SG-1's political enemies trying to convince their superiors to fire SG-1. These were, as noted above, the penultimate episodes of their respective seasons, done to save the budget for the finale.
<ul><li> "Politics" at the end of Season 1 — the Stargate team tries to persuade a politician to keep funding the project.
</li><li> "Out of Mind", last episode of Season 2 — the heroes have been captured by the enemy pretending to be friends and asking about past missions.
</li><li> "Disclosure" — the Stargate program is presented to representatives from other countries.
</li><li> "Inauguration" — the new President being briefed about the Stargate program. Interestingly enough, one of the clips of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> is from an original segment of the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> episode — "Disclosure".
</li><li> The Season 8 episode "Citizen Joe" is a quite delightful clip show that actually has very few clips in it — the eponymous Joe is a regular guy who had picked up an alien device seven years previously that gives him a psychic connection to SG-1's Colonel O'Neill. Most of the episode is Joe recounting the events of various SG-1 episodes to the customers in his barber shop, and eventually trying to sell them as short stories. Joe's friends and wife get to play the role of the SG-1 fan as they make comments and complaints that real-life fans have made. They comment on Jonas Quinn, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">temporary replacement</a> for Dr. Daniel Jackson (because the actor playing Jackson took a year off from the show), for example.
</li><li> The second episode of season 5, Threshold, is something of a "fake-out". The setup of the show is that the characters have to stay awake with Teal'c, talking to him. Just when the viewer is certain it's going to be a boring clip-show, it turns out every one of Teal'c's past memories is brand-new footage containing tons of character development.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>
<ul><li> The series has a clip show episode, "Letters from Pegasus". The characters record messages to be sent to Earth before they die, and footage from earlier in the season is aired again. It was mainly used to drive in the poignancy of that time in their lives as they were unable to describe all the things that had happened to them because the Stargate program is a secret. One memorable scene is footage of Atlantis rising from the ocean with an added voice-over entirely in Czech from Dr. Zelenka. However, the plot is still continued in-between the recorded messages.
</li><li> They have another clip show in the final season, in which the characters are put on trial by the inhabitants of the Pegasus Galaxy; the clips are flashbacks to the things they're accused of. (See SGA's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">Moral Dissonance</a></em> section to find out <em>just how much trouble</em> they were in.) They got off by basically saying "Yeah, well, we're still the only ones who can save your asses from the Wraith."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>:
<ul><li> While not strictly a clip show, there is an episode where the ship itself became a clip show of sorts, with different parts of it reverting to moments from different points in time, in a hilarious send-up of clip shows. You can recognize the episodes and even guess them, through all the seasons, reusing all the old hairstyles and everything that changed season to season.
</li><li> <em>Voyager</em> also has the sixth season episode "The Voyager Conspiracy", which see Seven of Nine hypothesising that various unconnected events over the course of the series are linked together into some big conspiracy theory, dating all the way back to the pilot episode. Extensive use of clips of events from several former episodes are used to help illustrate her points. It was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">TNG</a></em>'s "Shades of Grey" done <em>right</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> has one of the most abysmal clip shows ever in its second-season finale, "Shades of Grey" It was almost literally, "Riker's got a fever and the only prescription is A CLIP SHOW!"
</li><li> On the other hand, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> has a two-part episode, "The Menagerie", which is often named as a clip show, although all of the clips were from the unaired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">Pilot</a> episode. This fact is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in-universe due to the impossibility of things such as overhead shots of the Enterprise and alternating camera angles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop">Stroker and Hoop</a></em> made an interesting use of this trope during its season one finale (although it didn't get a second season). The heroes were being held in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> by someone who swore revenge on them. He would only release them if they could identify him. All the clips focused on a minor character who appeared in some (but not all) of the episodes in the series, whom they unwittingly wronged in every episode, either directly or indirectly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx">Lexx</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> <em>and</em> a major character's death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988">War of the Worlds (1988)</a></em> uses a clip show near the end of its first season, framed as the Blackwood project's presentation to a international conference on alien-fighting. The clip show section only takes up about half of the episode, however, as the aliens besiege the conference in order to prevent the producers from needing to magic up clips to go along with the presentations of the other countries involved.
</li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em> episode, "Mama's Review", Mama Carlson comes to review the progress of the radio station and Andy and Arthur Carlson ineffectually try to explain the bizarre disasters that have occured as seen in the clips. Unlike similar shows, this episode also features significant character development of both Mama and Son Carlson as each own up to their mistakes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Voyagers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Voyagers">Voyagers!</a></em>: "The Trial of Phineas Bogg" is an unusually good instance of this. The clips are mostly explained in-universe as recordings from the omni of past adventures.
</li><li> Small part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> series finale, "The Truth," feels like a clip show. In the episode, the characters recap the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> as part of Mulder's trial, and the clips accompany their recaps, but after the trial, there are new scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> has several.
<ul><li> The most memorable is the bard one, which has Gabrielle at bard school, where she sings the praises of Xena. This clip show also uses footage from the Steve Reeves movie sung by the bard Stallonus (as an actor called Sylverster), and footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus">Spartacus</a></em> sung by the bard Homer, who wins the competition by closing his eyes before singing (thus earning the nickname "the blind bard").
</li><li> Another Gabrielle-based clip show was very well done by going over the current arc, which had Xena and Gabby's relationship straining, and put a new spin on the events of a pivotal two-parter by exploring Gabrielle's motives. It also used cut footage to good effect AND served to close a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> that had been hanging (namely, how did Gabby get to China before Xena?).
</li><li> There is also a rather unusual example in the fourth season episode "Lifeblood"; the production company had filmed an hour-long pilot for a new series, <em>Amazon High</em>, which never got picked up (among other reasons, it doesn't appear to have been very good). So, instead, they edited a bunch of the footage into a <em>X:WP</em> episode that explained the "origin" of the Amazons through a series of vision quest flashbacks. Ergo: a Clip Show that didn't <em>look</em> like a Clip Show. Clever, yes?
</li><li> The episodes of both <em>Xena</em> and <em>Hercules</em> that are based in the present day are almost always clip shows, but it's understandable why those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">aren't discussed often.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em> has a "best of" clip show hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a>.
</li><li> The Season 7 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> episode "Our Finest Hour" has reporter Clete Roberts, previously used in the acclaimed Season 4 episode "The Interview", returning to the 4077th to interview the doctors and nurses for a black-and-white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryEpisode">TV documentary</a>. However, whereas the earlier episode featured all-new material and never broke from its concept, "Our Finest Hour" awkwardly inserts a large number of (color) clips from earlier episodes in a manner that destroys any kind of narrative flow in the Roberts segments. All of this goes a long way toward explaining why "Our Finest Hour" is regarded by many <em>M*A*S*H</em> fans as one of the weakest episodes in the show's run, making its title more than a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironic</a>.
</li><li> In its very first season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes">Diff'rent Strokes</a></em> has an episode where Mr. Drummond reminisces with Arnold and Willis while they prepare to celebrate their first Christmas together. That's right: not only did they give us a Clip Show a mere nine episodes into the show's run, they combined it with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> in the bargain! And it was a two-part episode, to boot. In the framing sequence, Mr. Drummond wakes up the kids in the middle of the night to remind them that it's the 8-week anniversary of their arrival.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em> did three.
<ul><li> "Amnesia" (Season 2): Confronting a drug trafficker responsible for a deadly hit-and-run, Jarod gets knocked out and left to freeze. He's saved by Argyle, but he can't remember who he is and experiences flashes of previous events. Meanwhile, the Centre Pursuit Team is put on trial for failing to catch Jarod, and their previous exploits are put under the microscope.
</li><li> "Mr. Lee" (Season 3): Mr. Lee tries to find Jarod by interviewing people from past episodes: Bernie Baxley ("Curious Jarod"), Susan Granger ("To Protect and Serve"), Rachel Newton ("Potato Head Blues"), Dr. Fein ("Back from the Dead"), and J.R. Miller ("Red Rock Jarod"); Mr. Lyle (a recurring character) is also interviewed. When the pursuit team learns of what he's doing, they track Lee's movements and intercept the list to talk to the same people. Notably, Jarod doesn't appear in new footage until the very end of the episode.
</li><li> "Ghosts from the Past" (Season 4): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">Angelo</a> senses that a foe from Jarod's past is coming back for revenge. Looking over materials recovered from past episodes, Angelo experiences flashes of various prior one-off villains with sizable scores to settle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight">Forever Knight</a></em>, "Close Call": Schanke starts putting together all the strange things he's noticed about Nick (and comes <em>this close</em> to confirming that Nick is a vampire).
</li><li> The twelfth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker">Legend of the Seeker</a></em> is a recap of the events of the early episodes, using the frame of Rahl tapping into Richard's mind with a spell and trying to get information out of him. The second season has another one, this time the frame being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">The Creator</a> putting Richard on trial.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDragonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDragonKnight">Kamen Rider Dragon Knight</a></em> has a rare and completely ridiculous example of a clip show that flashes back to <em>another clip show</em>. The show has a total of three. What's worse, the final battle and main resolution of the story takes place in the penultimate episodes, with the actual <em>final episode being a clipshow of the whole series,</em> which tied up some of the loose ends in passing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Kit's dad and Sting? Oh yeah, they got better."</span> No wonder the series was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">cancelled before either of these got to air...</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanelGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanelGame">Panel Shows</a> such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek">Mock the Week</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou">Would I Lie to You?</a>?</em> record upwards of 2 hours' footage for every programme, which is then edited down to half an hour. They thus get a lot of mileage out of clip shows showing highlights as well as some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scenes</a>. The BBC often airs these as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>.

In the former, the SSP clean up their apartment and reminisce about how far they've come as they dig up old treasures, while in the latter, Riku and Pega accidentally break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI">RE.M.</a> and try to restore her memories. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanMebius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanMebius">Ultraman Mebius</a></em> did a partial one ten years earlier. Like with <em>Orb</em> and <em>Geed</em>, it serves as a midway recap, as GUYS looks over some of the kaiju they've fought so far when trying to decide which one would make for a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Maquette Monster</a>. However, at the halfway point, it switches out to bring in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> storyline when their new Maquette Zetton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">goes rogue</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> has some clip shows, including one that aired outtakes, bloopers, and deleted scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em> had several of these. In one, the family members share stories with Alex's girlfriend Ellen; another has Alex's <em>second</em> girlfriend, Lauren, asking family members to relate past stories while working on a research paper ; still another has the men and women of the family rehashing past incidents while arguing at a restaurant; finally, there's one where everyone reminisces while Andy works on a time capsule he's planning to bury.

Unlike many clip shows before or after, there was no plot per se; it was merely Fonda introducing clips and providing commentary.
</li><li> The 200th episode, which came in early 1979, was an updated "best of" clip show, this time hosted by series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NormanLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NormanLear">Norman Lear</a>. As was the case with the original, the plot was discarded in favor of a montage of clips and commentary from Lear.

As a bonus, the show flashes back to their days on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em> and their conflicts with Archie Bunker.

Though one of the first known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">mockumentaries</a> to have a clip show, the episode followed a fairly standard clip show format, having characters recall past moments and grouping clips into accidents and injuries, Jim's pranks, romantic moments, etc. Though at least a third of the episode was new footage, the show got flack for being on hiatus for over a month and coming back to a clip show rather than a new episode.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, Earl was in a coma, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">coma dream</a> consisted of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom">Dom Com</a> where he was married to Billie Cunningham.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> featured a clip show in every season between seasons 3 and 7 - and every one was a double episode! For added benefit, the vast majority of clips were new footage and <em>not</em> from previous episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation">Air Crash Investigation</a></em>: The "Science of Disaster" episodes can be counted as this, as it's usually half a recap of air disasters centering around a theme (ATC, bad weather, pilot errors, etc.) and half an explanation about the theme itself and how to prevent similar disasters in the future.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em> centers entirely on the Warehouse agents reliving their 'most defining Warehouse moment.' The best part? <em>This is a complete subversion of the "reusing old footage" part of the trope</em>. All of the old footage that is used is only seen for a moment before the new content is introduced. All of the major flashback sequences were filmed <strong>especially</strong> for this episode, and actually end up being the most satisfying part.
</li><li> The '70s show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em> ended its run with a clip show, "The Greatest Rescues of Emergency!" as part of the two main characters reminiscing when they both get promoted to Captain.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTeam">Time Team</a></em> episode "Greatest Discoveries" is just the main presenters (Tony, Phil, Mick Aston, Helen Geake, and Tony) discussing past shows and clips thereof.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PsiFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PsiFactor">Psi Factor</a></em> episode "Tribunal" is another example. The team is questioned about the cases they investigated and their testimonies are accompanied by footage from earlier episodes.
</li><li> The first two series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnIdiotAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnIdiotAbroad">An Idiot Abroad</a></em> each ended with an episode called "Karl Comes Home". The framing device of Ricky and Steve asking Karl about his travels was similar in tone to their conversations on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheRickyGervaisShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheRickyGervaisShow">The Ricky Gervais Show</a></em>. The clips were also interspersed with unused footage from previous episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest">World's Dumbest...</a></em> has one in the form of a "bracket showdown," in which clips from previous episodes are stacked against each other, tournament-style. Some include new commentary from stars who joined after the clip in question originally aired, as well as NBA star Charles Barkley.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em> episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Stacy Forgets Her Name</a>", Stacy Jones loses her memory after she sniffs flowers Mr. Conductor had sprinkled with a potion intended to make bees forget they had to take nectar from the plants. Her nephew, Dan, and Mr. Conductor help jog her memory through clips from previous episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>
<ul><li> In the episode "The Devil Inside", a murderer who claims to be possessed by the spirit of James Gilles prompts William and Julia to relive their previous encounters with him.
</li><li> In the episode "Manual for Murder", a copycat killer is duplicating past cases based on Murdoch, Dr Odgen and Constable Crabtree's book <em>Solving Murder</em>. Flashbacks from the relevant episodes are shown with the characters reading the book in voiceover.
</li><li> In the episode "The Trial of Terrence Myers'', Murdoch's testimony on his past encounters with Agent Myers is related through clips from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceASeason">Once a Season</a> Myers episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode during the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sisters">Sisters</a></em> had the girls and their mother trapped during a snowstorm. They kept awake by reminiscing about past events.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman">Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</a></em> had several of these. Two were of Dr. Quinn and Sully reviewing their relationship (one during their premarital counseling, the other while he was trying to keep her awake after a head injury), the other was Dr. Quinn discussing her most interesting cases with daughter Colleen, who was preparing to go to medical school herself.
</li><li> The finale episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetAjay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetAjay">Planet Ajay</a></em>, "Highlights Show", is a clip show depicting some of the highlights of the series. In this episode, the main character Ajay packs up to leave on a <em>very</em> long trip around the universe (it's <em>2,517</em> years long, to be precise), and Chips the robot reminds Ajay of all the friends he has on Planet Ajay. Ajay remembering all that his friends did for him is used as the framing device for the clips, which are supposed to be Ajay's memories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBuild">Kamen Rider Build</a></em> has two that occur over the first half of their respective episodes before the main plot resumes during the second half. Interestingly, the clip shows are used by the heroes to make deductions that advance the plot. The first clip show is the heroes reviewing footage of previous battles and explaining how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets">Transformation Trinkets</a> work in order to figure out a way to safely use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Hazzard Trigger</a>. The deductions they make lead to the development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a> form. Later, the heroes do a more comprehensive recap of the series events in order to figure out what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is currently planning based on his plans thus far. They end up figuring out that his early attacks on the heroes all followed a pattern, except for one that seemingly didn't until they did some further digging and found it had a very important connection.
</li><li> The game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaveToWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaveToWin">Save to Win</a></em> had two clip shows to end out the run. Egregiously, one of the clips actually depicts something that never happened on the show. The blink-and-you-miss-it clip shows a team winning the $5,000, having picked products 8 and 12. Thats not how it went down on the actual episode; the team had really only won $1,700 by picking 4 and 16.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaTurtlesTheNextMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaTurtlesTheNextMutation">Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</a></em> had two clip show episodes.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice">Miami Vice</a></em> episode "A Bullet for Crockett" has most of the characters reminiscing about past missions when Crockett is shot during a drug bust gone bad.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadMansGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadMansGun">Dead Man's Gun</a></em>: In the clip show based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> "A Just Reward", a criminal is hired to retrieve the gun for the enigmatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrSmith">Mr. Smith</a>, killing the guns' previous owners in the process.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stingray1964" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stingray1964">Stingray1964</a></em>: "Aquanaut Of The Year" (in which Troy is being honoured as part of <em>This Is Your Life</em> - cue flashbacks to previous missions).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds">Thunderbirds</a></em>: "Security Hazard" (in which a little boy named Chip stows away on Thunderbird 2 and when found is put in the care of the brothers and Jeff - cue flashbacks to previous missions as Virgil, Alan, Scott and Gordon explain how their craft are important).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons">Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</a></em>: "The Inquisition" (in which Captain Blue is being interrogated by a representative of Spectrum Intelligence - cue flashbacks to previous missions as Blue tries to show he is who he says he is). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He eventually realises it's a Mysteron plot.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Joe90" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Joe90">Joe90</a></em>: "The Birthday" (in which Joe finally celebrates his 10th birthday - cue flashbacks to previous missions).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Terrahawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Terrahawks">Terrahawks</a></em>: "Ma's Monsters" (in which Zelda is unhappy over her constant failures to wipe out the Terrahawks - cue flashbacks to... you know).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarFleet">Star Fleet</a></em> had 3 of these... in a 25 episode run. Due to the redundancy, the third one was simply skipped in the English dub.
<ul><li> The third clip show seems to be excluded from import packages, as the French, Italian and Arabic versions also exclude it.
</li><li> The second clip show (Episode thirteen) is a unique example, with the continuity of episodes being scrambled, as well as the events of Episodes 8 and 10 being merged.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>
<ul><li> The 1994 special, "Sesame Street All-Star 25th Birthday: Stars and Street Forever!" shows clips from various episodes and sketches, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">over-arching story</a> being about the citizens of Sesame Street attempting to save the neighborhood from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trumplica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trumplica">Ronald Grump</a> and his plan to turn it into the Grump Tower.
</li><li> 1989's <em>20 And Still Counting</em>, hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a>, fits this trope as well.
</li><li> And then there's <em>The Street We Live On</em> from 2004, which mostly plays as an extended <em>Elmo's World</em> episode except that its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> segments work in some older clips. A retrospective of the show's 35-year history is also shown at the very end of the special.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMrPotatoHeadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMrPotatoHeadShow">The Mr. Potato Head Show</a></em>: The final two episodes of the show are unabashed clip shows; Mr. Potato Head has frequent flashbacks to earlier episodes when he hears that the show has been cancelled to justify most of them. However, at one point, the narrator just says they're going to show the audience some clips <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">just because</a>. It's as if they were deliberately aiming for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> had episode called "Sing Yourself To Sleep" that was a unique twist on this. The episode used songs from past episodes, but it had no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Noddy's Toyland Adventures</a></em> segment, instead having clips from previous segments play over the song "The Friend You'll Find In Me".
<ul><li> "Find Your Own Song" also utilizes the same method for the <em>Noddy's Toyland Adventures</em> segments as "Sing Yourself to Sleep", where clips from that series are shown over the songs "You've Got Talent" and "Follow Your Voice" instead.

<ul><li> The 1951 short <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HisHareRaisingTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HisHareRaisingTale">His Hare Raising Tale</a></em> has Bugs Bunny telling his nephew Clyde about his adventures from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BaseballBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BaseballBugs">Baseball Bugs</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StageDoorCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StageDoorCartoon">Stage Door Cartoon</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitPunch">Rabbit Punch</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FallingHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FallingHare">Falling Hare</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HaredevilHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HaredevilHare">Haredevil Hare</a></em>.
</li><li> 1954's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThisIsALife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThisIsALife">This Is A Life</a></em>, where Bugs is feted on a testimonial TV show (Daffy thinks <em>he's</em> the one being celebrated), uses clips from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuccaneerBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuccaneerBunny">Buccaneer Bunny</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HareDo">Hare Do</a></em>.
</li><li> The 1958 short <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FeatherBluster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FeatherBluster">Feather Bluster</a></em> has an elderly Foghorn Leghorn and Barnyard Dawg recalling their past pranks on each other with the grandsons listening in, with clips from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HenhouseHenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HenhouseHenery">Henhouse Henery</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHighAndTheFlighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHighAndTheFlighty">The High And The Flighty</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllFowledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllFowledUp">All Fowled Up</a></em>.

</li><li> The 1959 short <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TweetDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TweetDreams">Tweet Dreams</a></em> has Sylvester going to a psychiatrist about his problems with Tweety, using clips from <em>Too Hop to Handle</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SandyClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SandyClaws">Sandy Claws</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TweetysCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TweetysCircus">Tweetys Circus</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AStreetCatNamedSylvester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AStreetCatNamedSylvester">A Street Cat Named Sylvester</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GiftWrapped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GiftWrapped">Gift Wrapped</a></em>. Oddly, the clip from the first short, which featured Sylvester with his son, is presented as a flashback to Sylvester as a kitten with <em>his</em> father.
</li><li> The 1964 short <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FreudyCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FreudyCat">Freudy Cat</a></em> has Sylvester Jr. taking his father to a psychiatrist to talk about his problems with the "giant mouse", as illustrated with scenes from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSlapHoppyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSlapHoppyMouse">The Slap Hoppy Mouse</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatsAweigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatsAweigh">Cats Aweigh</a>!</em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhosKittenWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhosKittenWho">Whos Kitten Who</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Phineas and Ferb</em> had a "Musical Cliptastic Countdown" composed of clips from their most memorable <em>musical</em> numbers, as voted on by the viewers. There's also "Phineas's Birthday Clip-o-Rama", where the gang makes a clip show for Phineas's birthday. As expected, they take joy in lampshading this trope at every chance they get. It is also a subversion because there is at least one clip in each segment that didn't come from any episode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">makes no sense at all.</a>
</li><li> There is also the episode "This Is Your Backstory", which is a much more traditional clip show. Dr. Doofenschmirtz makes a device that will use all of his tragic backstories to make his more evil. It also comes off as a not-quite-successful attempt to organize his numerous backstories.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to re-using old animation in "new" theatrical shorts and TV specials, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Warner Brothers cartoon set</a> has five <em>movies</em> devoted to this. The first, <em>The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie</em> (1979), is a <em>That's Entertainment!</em>-esque retrospective hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> in new linking segments; the sequels use new animation to link the shorts together into a long storyline. For example, <em>Daffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island</em> has a framing device of various characters making wishes in a wishing well. You can easily tell what is original footage and what isn't because of the difference in animation. Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc">Mel Blanc</a>'s voice was noticeably different towards the end of his life, making it easy to distinguish original lines from lines that were redubbed to fit the plot of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em>' Had a mini episode called Winslow's Home Movies sandwiched between two other episodes, where Winslow plays a video tape of his favorite and most humiliating CatDog moments. The episode ends with Winslow nearly getting flushed out of the house after CatDog flood the place while taking a bath. CatDog goes surfing out the front door, and Winslow ends up tied to The TV monitor hanging upside down. Not only was he showing clips he had previously videotaped, he was videotaping CatDog taking a bath and broadcasting it live
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em>'s second season ended with "Clip Job", a clip show that deconstructed clip shows. The framing story had a disgruntled television critic kidnapping the titular character and trying to convince him that <em>Duckman</em> is the most immoral show of all time. Duckman is unaware that he is a television character, and can't understand where and how the critic acquired all the clips of his past adventures, which he uses to torture Duckman by showing him the worst aspects of his personality. In the end Duckman is rescued, and his sons Charles and Mambo point out that if their life really were a TV program then this occurrence would have been a clip show created as an excuse to spend less money on original production. Duckman scoffs at the idea and asks who could possibly be so cynical to do such a thing. He then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">stares out at the audience</a> as the credits start to roll, beginning with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">the names of the series' executive producers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> has a clip show centered around the paranoid rantings of a recurring background character. (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra">Recurring Extra</a>.)
<ul><li> A more Subtle version occured in the episode Avalon, Part II, where the villain of the three part episode has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> powers in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> status and use them to instruct his younger self how to attain these powers. Because of the nature of Time Travel in the Gargoyles universe, which is always stable time loops, the net result is him traveling to different past episodes to arrange the various elements to fall into his younger self's possession only after they become no longer story relative. While his interaction in the old episode segments is new footage, it's often inter cut with old footage to save on animation, creating several noticeable <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBumps">Animation Bumps</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey">Kappa Mikey</a></em> decides to go meta for its clip show episode... the plot revolves around putting together a clip show for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">phlebotinum-induced</a> one, in which Jackie actually has to travel to several points in the past, while trying not to change the outcome of his adventures.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JayJayTheJetPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JayJayTheJetPlane">Jay Jay the Jet Plane</a></em> episode "Snuffy's Seasons" has Snuffy remember several memories of past episodes as the others teach him about the seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders">Shadow Raiders</a></em> has a clip show based around Graveheart having a crisis of faith in his leadership abilities. It consisted of each of the main characters going "Did I just hear you want to quit? What about the time you did X?" and a clip would roll. Sadly, one of the series' weaker episodes, though it did resolve this arc for his character, for what that's worth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> (like many other sitcoms) has clip shows, only theirs are a little different:
<ul><li> "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons' Clip Show" (Season 4): It's April Fools' Day and Bart has had it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsPlot">Homer's pranks</a>, so Bart shakes a can of beer up so much that it explodes (using a paint shaker at a local hardware store), putting Homer in a coma. While Homer is in a coma, the rest of the family (and Mr. Burns) reminisces about all the wacky adventures the Simpsons have had from seasons 1 through the first half of 4. Includes a self-referential joke where Bart remembers an "Itchy and Scratchy" cartoon and says, "It was an amusing episode...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">of our lives</a>."
</li><li> "Another Simpsons Clip Show" (Season 6): After reading <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgesOfMadisonCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgesOfMadisonCounty">The Bridges of Madison County</a></em>, Marge decides to gather the family in the kitchen so they can discuss their love lives (most of which ended in tragedy [Bart getting his heart broken by Laura from "New Kid on the Block" and Lisa yelling at Ralph in "I Love Lisa") or near-infidelity (Homer almost sleeping with his coworker Mindy in "The Last Temptation of Homer" and Marge almost driving to Jacques the French bowler's house in "Life in the Fast Lane"). Notable for intentionally taking the concept to its extreme by having next to no new footage for its framing scenes: the kitchen sequence used for most of the episode was reused from Season 2's "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish", and one of the only other scenes was similarly recycled from Season 1's "Krusty Gets Busted" (meaning it looks notably less polished than the surrounding footage), with only the very first scene featuring new animation. (Even the couch gag was recycled.) It's also notable for making a joke about how the cel-animated cartoons of old recycled clips to make new scenes and episodes that would only be seen as new in the eyes of naive viewers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">much like</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a></em>).
</li><li> "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" (Season 7): A take on sitcom retrospective episodes of the 1970s (like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em> example mentioned above). It had Troy McClure hosting a retrospective of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, showing viewers the show's early years as animated filler on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></em>, deleted scenes from popular episodes (all of which are real, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>), including the infamous "Robotic Richard Simmons" scene from season 5's "Burns' Heir" and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateEnding">Alternate Ending</a> to "Who Shot Mr. Burns?: Part 2", portraying Matt Groening as a bald, drunken gun nut (instead of a bearded, bespectacled nerd), and, of course, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">hard-core nudity</a>!". Interestingly, this is the only Simpsons episode animated entirely in the United States.
</li><li> "All Singing, All Dancing" (Season 9): Starts out as a normal episode (much like "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons' Clip Show") where Homer rents <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaintYourWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaintYourWagon">Paint Your Wagon</a></em>, thinking it was a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> western before finding out it's actually a musical, then complains that musicals suck, prompting the rest of the family to show video clips of the many times the Simpson family (and the people of Springfield) have broken out in song. In response to this, Snake barges in and holds the entire family hostage, but leaves when he realizes how weird it is to hold a singing family at gunpoint. Has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Funny Aneurysm" Moment</a> during the credits where gunshots can be heard when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a>'s name appears in the credits (to make matters worse, this was the last episode for which Hartman did voicework shown before he died, although his voice appeared in "Bart the Mother," a leftover season nine episode that aired in season 10).
</li><li> "Gump Roast" (Season 13): Homer is honored at a Friars' Club Roast, when Kang and Kodos invade so they can enslave humanity. Not much to write home about, except for the end song, sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheBillyJoelParodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheBillyJoelParodies">parodying</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheBillyJoelParodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDidntStartTheBillyJoelParodies">"We Didn't Start the Fire" and the lyric</a>: "We're sorry for the clip show!" Also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> moment where the song mentions an episode with a "crazy wedding" involving Patty, Selma, and Grampa getting married to each other. Selma and Grampa would marry each other in season 18's "Rome-Old and Juli-Ech." Patty, on the other hand, would get married in season 16's "There's Something About Marrying," but in that episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she would almost marry a man who looks like a woman and break up with her near-husband/wife because Patty just revealed to Marge that she was a lesbian — despite her and Selma's crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver</a></span>. Also of note that this is the last clip show the writers have done, according to the season 13 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">DVD commentary</a>, as the writers have now taken to doing "trilogy" episodes [episodes with three separate stories for each act], such as "Margical History Tour," "Tales From The Public Domain," "Love: Springfieldian Style," "Simpsons Christmas Stories," "Four Great Women and a Manicure," and "The Fight Before Christmas."
<ul><li> The show itself sent "Gump Roast" up just one week later with "I Am Furious (Yellow)", in which Bart makes Homer the subject of his highly popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/AngryDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/AngryDad">Angry Dad</a></em> cartoon; when Homer catches on, he immediately swears off all expressions of anger. Bart, watching Homer get hit by objects but not reacting, says, "Come <em>on</em>, Angry Dad! Get angry! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Don't make me do a clip show!</a>"
</li><li> In addition to the full-episode clip shows, there were some partial clip shows <em>The Simpsons</em> had: in season 5's "Bart's Inner Child," Lisa and Bart think back to all the times Marge has nagged them after Marge asks if she nags the family all the time.
</li><li> In season 11's "Behind the Laughter", the family is portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">Animated Actors</a>. During the "documentary", clips are shown from "Bart the Daredevil" and "The Principal and the Pauper", as well as scenes of previous guest stars.
</li><li> In season 13's "The Blunder Years," Homer thinks back to the time he jumped over Springfield Gorge (from season 2's "Bart the Daredevil"), but Lisa interrupts, stating that everyone is sick of that flashback.
</li><li> In season 19's "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind," Homer travels through his mind to see what he did to make his family leave him. If you look closely at the background, you can see clips of scenes from the past 18 seasons).
</li><li> In season 20's "How the Test was Won," there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow">Fully Automatic Clip Show</a> of the many times Homer has injured himself.

(when Henry's thinking back to the moments that Mr. Foot beat him up) played clips from previous episodes.

<ul><li> The original 1993 series had five clip show episodes: "The Tribunal", "The Inquisition", "Villain of the Year", "Mad Scientist Wanted", and "Academy of Hard Knocks".
</li><li> The 2006 revival had two clip show episodes: "Carbine's Conundrum" and "Cat and Mouse".

<ul><li> The episode <em>Grill</em>, in which Agent Fowler must make a case to his superiors for Team Prime to stay active on Earth in the wake of MECH's plots to discredit the Autobots with a fake version of Optimus.
</li><li> In the same season, we also got the episode <em>Patch</em>, where Megatron enters Starscream's mind and overviews Starscream's previous plots against him to see if he should rejoin the Decepticons.

It's just a half hour of randomly assembled clips with no explanation...and with no dialog. Yes, for some reason, all the dialog has been removed from the clips, resulting in 30 minutes of silent reused animation playing over background music. Kids were understandably confused and upset. When the episode aired in syndication, they put the voices back in and added some new narration, most of which has nothing to do with the action on screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em>: "Schpiel-borg 2000" starts off as this.

One was "Humanitarian of the Year", where Cruella attempts to win the mentioned title for publicity, while the pups find photographs she ordered Horace and Jasper to hide of her being her usual cruel self, bringing up clips from previous episodes (Oddly, there were no cameras present to take pictures of these situations). Next was "Horace and Jasper's Big Career Move", where Horace and Jasper try to find new jobs, bringing up events of previous episodes. "The Making Of..." uses a few clips from previous episodes at first, but then goes off on its' own.

Fans usually consider <em>All Growed Down</em> the show's third movie while <em>Miracle on Third Street</em> is just a special</span> <em>Recess Christmas: Miracle on Third Street</em> and <em>Recess: All Growed Down</em> both consisted of episodes of the television show (Four for the former, three for the latter) with linking material. Some fans felt ripped off because they hardly got anything new, but it could've been Disney's secret way of saying "Alright, we're not making new episodes of this show. Buy these now before we take the show off!"
<ul><li> <em>Recess Christmas: Miracle on Third Street</em> (released a day after the show aired its final episode) took place right after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, with Principal Prickly carpooling Miss Finster and Miss Grotke home after school, until his car gets stuck in a snowbank, making him and Miss Finster instantly blame the kids, due to them having to deal with their pranks every day. So Miss Grotke tries to explain to them that the kids aren't as bad as they make them out to be, bringing up previous episodes ("Principal for a Day", "The Great Can Drive", "Weekend at Muriel's", and "Yes, Mikey, Santa Does Shave"), which play as part of the movie.
</li><li> <em>Recess: All Growed Down</em> (Released two years after the show ended, along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessTakingTheFifthGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RecessTakingTheFifthGrade">Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade</a></em>) was about the gang getting kidnapped by the kindergarteners, though only because their new leader, Chief Stinky wanted them to, and made the other kindergarteners believe that the older kids were bad. So the gang try to re-affirm the fact that they've been nice to them by bringing up (And playing) the episodes "The Legend of Big Kid", "Wild Child", and "Kindergarten Derby", and the rest of the film is new material- specifically, Gus bringing up the gang's origin story of how they met in kindergarten.

Most of the footage used was new, but there was a flashback to earlier in the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode, "DW's Perfect Wish" has Arthur cheer up a depressed D.W. on her fifth birthday by reminding her of all the good times she had when she was four.
</li><li> The episode, "Best Day Ever", has Arthur's friends remembering their favorite days, and Arthur trying to come up with one for himself. Even though video clips from older episodes are used, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackWithTheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackWithTheOtherDarrin">dubbed with the show's current voice actors</a>.
</li><li> In some ways, the episode "Arthur's Almost Live Not Real Music Festival" was like a clip show with two of the songs: "Leftovers Goulash" and "(Just a Little) Homework", both songs set to various clips from previous episodes, and in many cases, it's quite funny.

</li><li> The "Wolves, Witches, and Giants" episode "The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" contains one of these with the Wolf conducting his latest scheme by dressing up as a sheep so he can blend in with the herd and eat them and his partner the Fox telling him that it's bound to fail, he then shows him a videotape of his various failures throughout the series, and the Wolf tries to counter this by showing him his few victories, and his scheme fails as the Giant tries to eat him and he escapes by slipping out of the skin.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> had two direct-to-video films, a Halloween one called <em>Mickey's House of Villains</em> and a Christmas one called <em>Snowed in at the House of Mouse</em>. Both of them happened to consist mostly of recycled animation (though Mickey's introduction in <em>House of Villains</em> had the animation redone so that his vampire costume was less ghoulish). Technically speaking, the original show itself was a clip show as the cartoons shown at the House of Mouse were mainly recycled shorts from <em>Mickey MouseWorks</em> as well as some of the classic Disney shorts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> did several "cheater" cartoons.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> took this is an absurd extreme: the <em>entire fifth season</em> is a massive clip show in which a large puppet version of Powermaster Optimus Prime tells a young boy stories from the Autobot-Decepticon war, with each story consisting of an episode from one of the earlier seasons and the movie edited down somewhat to make room for the new segments with the kid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a>:</em>
<ul><li> "Demons Aren't Dull" uses clips from the very first series in a sequence unrelated to the story's main plot. While searching for a dimensional demon, Danger Mouse is re-routed to a <em>This is Your Life</em>-themed TV show which uses the clips to magnify his presumed shortcomings (all a Greenback plot in a ruse to get DM to resign as a secret agent).

This was to convince the head of E.G.O. that Jumba is still evil and his membership should not be revoked. Notably, the segment showed nearly the entirety of Slushy (523) and Splodyhead (619)'s epic fight from the former experiment's episode, and in that episode Jumba stated that he forgot to bring his camera. It should also be noted that "Ace" was originally supposed to have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ersoz.com/storyboard/sb_pages/ls_ace.htm">a much more substantial plot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and not be a clip show, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">it was changed in the wake of a then-recent tsunami</a>.

The final episode starts its second half with what appears to be a regular clip show. Then things start getting strange when characters flash back to events that didn't happen the way they happened. In Mutsumi's case, events that weren't even in the same <em>genre</em>. And it gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> weirder; apparently Tsuda's souvenir actually <em>changed</em> to conform to Shino's warped memory, causing Tsuda to go into a short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. That the whole thing is topped off with a preview for the show that will be taking their time slot (that also doesn't exist) cements the show taking a sledgehammer to the fourth wall.

He then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">summarizes all the previous episodes in two minutes</a>, teases the audience for thinking that he was serious, and compliments the show on how its fast pace made this go so quickly.

The first was halfway through the series and was about half and half between old and new content (with the premise of a New Year's gameshow that had clips for some reason), while the second was about five episodes later and recapped the Pedro storyline, consisting almost entirely of recycled content up until the end when the storyline was expanded on a bit. Naturally, since this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>, it was parodied: Not all the clips shown play out like they did in the episodes which turns "remember that time" into a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.

The four serials (or one, or three, depending on who you ask) are set out like a clip show but it's all new footage of adventures that the Doctor supposedly had after the end of the previous season, and a major plot point is whether the "evidence" seen in the flashbacks may have been altered by an unknown party to make the Doctor look worse.

<ul><li> Satirized in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a>'s 100th Episode special, where the Critic appears on-camera to tell the audience that they can watch some lame clips of his past episodes while he goes backstage to smoke a joint... until the characters in the clips call him out on it and insist that he review <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth">Battlefield Earth</a></em>. In the commentary for that episode, Mr. Walker said he planned to do a clip show... but with all the clips not being from any episode. Seems like he wanted to do some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">personal favorites</a>...

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>'s penultimate episode had another variation: the characters attend a play about their adventures, which provides a more-or-less accurate summary of the series so far while somehow managing to get the details comically wrong and accurately poke fun at itself at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spoofed in the episode "The Good Ol' Ed", which had the Eds collecting things from previous episodes for a time capsule and reminiscing about past misadventures. While events of actual episodes were mentioned, all the "flashbacks" were to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnInstallment">events never seen in previous episodes</a> (a fake time machine scam, Edd getting a bad case of the hiccups, and the Eds trying to make the world's biggest pancake), all of which ended with the other members of the trio protesting that said event never happened. The only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashback</a> to something that actually happened was Ed remembering the opening of the <em>current</em> episode, which was interrupted by Eddy smacking Ed with a fish and shouting "I <em>hate</em> clip shows!"
</li><li> In a similar vein was the episode "Every Which Way But Ed," where the Eds end up getting physically lost in the flashbacks of multiple secondary characters, and must find their way back to the present. Unfortunately, they end up going so far back that they end up in the day Edd first met the other two members of the trio, and Eddy, never one to ignore a scam, has Ed slam a house on Edd to give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">amnesia</a>, so he would pay to watch Ed eat a TV. This time, however, Ed ends up accidentally eating Eddy as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "Phineas's Birthday Clip-o-Rama" is both a straight example and a subversion, because there is at least one clip in each segment that didn't come from any episode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">makes no sense at all.</a>
</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries">Clerks: The Animated Series</a></em> is a clip show that flashes back to a single scene of the first episode several times and then starts making up clips from episodes that had never happened. As well as showing clips from that episode that happened 5 minutes ago. Made even better by the fact that the series was shown out of production order and as such there are no clips or references to the fourth episode of the series which was actually the first to air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spoofed in an episode ("The City of Clipsville"): The episode starts out looking like a clip show, but the clips quickly turn into outrageous, bizarre events that never took place. Ultimately it turns out the clip show was a clip, with them at the end saying "Remember when we were remembering things?"
</li><li> A more subtle spoof happens in "Monkey See, Doggy Two" (the sequel to "Monkey See, Doggy Do"). The episode actually begins exactly the same way as its predecessor. When the Powerpuff Girls realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes">Mojo Jojo is reusing his plan</a> they quickly confront him...and he reveals he's made a new plan by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurveillanceAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurveillanceAsThePlotDemands">looking at the footage from his old one</a> to figure out what he did wrong. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">He then shows the footage</a>, which are clips from the original episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST">as the four provide commentary.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed in the final episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em> cartoon. While captured by the most memorable villains of the series, Sam and Max reminisce about things that never happened in the show. They continue to do this while escaping.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> parodies this in "City on the Edge of Forever," where the children recall incidents from past episodes, but their stories increasingly diverge from the original episodes. Eventually the kids starts lampshading the fact that the original stories didn't happen quite like that. Ultimately the episode is explained away as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> of Cartman's, which then turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream">Dream Within a Dream</a> of Stan's, who notes, "I must have some serious emotional problems!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em> episode "Grim Reaper Gutters" started out as a subversion of a clip show where at least a couple of the flashback turned out to be camera footage secretly compiled by Frylock and Meatwad. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Their clip show ends when Meatwad, faced with his depressing and meaningless life, kills himself.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers">Duck Dodgers</a></em> uses a subversion in "Deconstructing Dodgers", where specific episodes and incidents are mentioned, but the actual clips shown are outtakes, unused gags or even one-shot jokes with no setup or context whatsoever.
</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeTysonMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeTysonMysteries">Mike Tyson Mysteries</a></em> episode "My Favorite Mystery". The Mystery Team gets stuck in an elevator with an old man and begin reminiscing about their favorite mysteries, all of them being extended clips from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHoggingOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHoggingOpening">Action-Hogging Opening</a> rather than clips from previous episodes. The old man then reveals that he was present for about half of them, having been part of the bank robbery that Marquess tried to stop, then used the money to create the dinosaurs and the samurai robot Mike crashed a jet into, and was also the guy in kabuki makeup that Mike punched in the opening.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama Action</a></em>, where they briefly return to Camp Wawanakwa from the first season.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chris:</strong> If you need to take a moment to reminisce about the great times you had here... <br/><strong>Everyone else:</strong> <em>[laugh for a rather long time]</em> <br/><strong>Chris:</strong> Fine. We'll skip the good memories montage.
</div></li><li> There's an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> in which Wanda and Timmy show clips to prove what a good godparent, friend, and humor generator Cosmo is — but they're all things that must've happened between episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity">Motorcity</a></em> did this with the episode "Threat Level: Texas" in which Texas retells events that happened in "Power Trip," "The Duke of Detroit" and "Going Dutch" only to match his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">Self-Serving Memory</a>, so believes that all the good ideas and KaneCo attacks were performed by him instead of Mike. Everyone in these flashbacks are incredibly out of character and can't stop talking about how "awesome" Texas is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">The Finale</a>" starts off as a clip show by showing scenes from previous episodes as the Wattersons look through their photo album. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">this quickly gets dropped</a> after Hector's Mom reminds the Wattersons that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroismWontPayTheBills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroismWontPayTheBills">they owe the town large amounts of money to pay for the damages caused by their past actions</a>. Afterwards, while events from past episodes are constantly mentioned, only twice are clips from past episodes shown, the first of which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow">Fully Automatic Clip Show</a> of Richard's reckless driving.
</li><li> "The Compilation" has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> of being an inexplicable "best of" video, but only the introduction clips are from previous episodes.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> was still being shown in theaters, several shorts were compiled in the manner of Bugs telling stories to Yosemite Sam, and at least one where Bugs, as a (possibly) retired multimillionaire tells the story of his life to an unseen reporter; later television reruns often had segments where Bugs (and occasionally Daffy, trying to execute a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">Hostile Show Takeover</a>) acted as the "host" at the beginning and end of the cartoons being shown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>
<ul><li> In the episode "Total Rickall", the Smith household is invaded by alien parasites that multiply by implanting fake memories into people's heads, and taking on the form of a random, zany character. The parasite multiplies every time someone has a fake flashback, leading to a whole lot of fake flashbacks and colorful characters appearing out of nowhere. Eventually, the Smiths realize they can tell which family members are real by remembering <em>bad</em> memories of them, and the resulting flashbacks are real but new to the audience.
</li><li> "Morty's Mind Blowers" is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Rick downright admits</a> that is "a clip show made of <em>clips you never sawwww!!!</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has an episode <em>literally</em> named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">Bottle Episode</a>". It features the Titans getting stuck in a giant bottle and remembering the past through clips. It features almost nothing but lampshadings on the topic, with Robin being angry that they're remembering the past instead of singing new songs and having adventures while the others complain that trips cost money and try to make Robin believe that flashbacks aren't boring.
<ul><li> There was also "Garage Sale", which did this with items (like the Mumfie example above) rather than clips of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmysMythicMornings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmysMythicMornings">Amys Mythic Mornings</a></em> has an episode dedicated to simply playing all the songs from earlier episodes without story.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleCharmers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleCharmers">Little Charmers</a></em> has several episodes like "Magic of Charmville" which is 95% clips. It gets especially weird when they air this prior to some of the episodes the clips are from.
