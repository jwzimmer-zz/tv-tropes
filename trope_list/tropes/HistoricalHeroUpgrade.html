</p><p>But there's a problem: most of the real life figures were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">morally grey and complex people.</a> How are you going to make sure that your audience knows who the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">hero</a> is?
</p><p>Well, all you have to do is to pick someone who was on your side. If you're American, all you have to do is choose a heroic American. Or failing that, an Irishman or a Scotsman (just as long as they fought those dastardly Englishmen/Germans/Commies/Arabs).

</p><p>Well, all you have to do is give your newfound hero a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet-the-Dog</a> moments, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate">adjust his looks for modern tastes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">cut out</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">ignore</a> anything of his life that doesn't fit your artistic vision.
</p><p>Note that just because this trope happens to a person does NOT mean that he was evil in real life; he is simply being portrayed more positively in the work of fiction than he was in real life. Also note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">this is not necessarily a bad thing</a>, as it is often done to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">make for a better story</a>.
</p><p>Note that this trope isn't always played seriously; sometimes, a character will be retroactively turned into something on par with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> purely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, upgraded in ways that are obviously intended to go far beyond any real-world heroism.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> has given us some examples, perhaps out of a desire to find some good among the bad.
<ul><li> One example prolific enough to have its own Wikipedia article: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_clean_Wehrmacht">the myth of the Clean Wehrmacht.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Basically the very common perception that most crimes committed by the Third Reich were done by the Waffen SS or Gestapo, and that the average German soldier was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> fighting for his home like any other soldier. In reality, the Wehrmacht were responsible for the deaths of millions of people and cooperated closely with the SS to exterminate Slavs and Jews, and the average German soldier was a hardcore genocidal racist who genuinely believed in the Nazi cause. The soldiers were heavily indoctrinated with Nazi ideology prior to and during the war. Even those who came to oppose Hitler (such as the July 22 plotters) did not always do so from motives we would regard as "noble." Rather, they were mostly afraid Hitler was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">losing the war</a>, and another loss would ruin Germany, feeling that overthrowing him to end it with a negotiated peace would be their best outcome. Most accepted the standard antisemitic, anti-Slavic, German nationalist view, although not always to the genocidal degree of the Nazis. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilm_Hosenfeld">Some<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Drossel">honorable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Plagge">exceptions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Battel">existed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, of course, including <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Castle_Itter">one extraordinary instance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Wehrmacht soldiers fighting side-by-side with U.S. soldiers and Austrian resistance members</a> against the Waffen-SS.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel">Erwin Rommel</a> probably has the best reputation among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>, and the myth surrounding him also has its own <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rommel_myth">Wikipedia article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. During the war, Rommel was renowned by the Nazis for his abilities in battle and by the Allies for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">a man of honor who did not commit the war crimes that were endemic in the German military</a>. He was also allegedly involved in the July 20 plot to assassinate Hitler and killed by the regime as a result. The popular image of Rommel as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> (in the West) and "good German" (in reformed Germany) endured after the war. The truth was a lot more complicated. Rommel was arrogant, ambitious, and something of a glory hound, and he took advantage of the regime's favor to cultivate a larger-than-life reputation. While he resisted illegal decrees and possibly participated in the July 20 plot, he likely had selfish motivations for doing both. He did openly resent the SA stormtroopers and later the SS that supplanted them, but this wasn't for entirely pure-hearted reasons either. He <em>did</em> disapprove of their brutality, seeing them as thugs that were unworthy of Germany, but he also felt that the resources and budget that went to them rightfully belonged to the Wehrmacht. He wasn't bloodthirsty like the average Nazi or a complete paragon of virtue, but somewhere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">in the middle</a>.
</li><li> Hitler's chief architect and later Minister of Armaments Albert Speer tends to be cast in a relatively favorable light as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> by many movies that take his (logically) biased memoirs at face value. It also helps that he is one of the only Nazis who declared himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> at the Nuremberg Trials, as well not being particularly obsessed with the whole racial purity thing. But they often tend to overlook his eager use of slave labor, disposession of Jewish tenants for his architectural plans, and his sheer efficiency at managing the German economy prolonging the war unnecessarily. To what extent he knew about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a> is also up for debate. It's also debated how sincere his desire for atonement was, and whether he simply realized that for the Nuremberg Trials to be seen as legitimate the Allies <em>needed</em> a repentant Nazi who would confess his crimes and give an insider account of the crimes of the Nazi regime as a whole, making him simply a war criminal who got the equivalent of a plea bargain in exchange for testifying against his accomplices. While not <em>as</em> horrible as someone like Himmler, filmmakers are too easy with swinging the pendulum in the other direction, when in real life he was a very morally ambiguous man. The German docudrama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpeerUndEr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpeerUndEr">Speer Und Er</a></em> at least got this right by never downplaying his personal failings.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to recent portrayals like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a>, Guy Fawkes has come to be seen as a symbol for anarchists and other protestors against the establishment. Lauded as "the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions", Guy Fawkes masks are a common sight in protests these days. Which is fairly odd as the real Guy Fawkes wasn't striking a blow against oppression or the establishment, he was part of a plot to assassinate the Protestant King James I in favor of the next in line, the Catholic Princess Elizabeth (not that one). The quip about being an honest man in Parliament refers to the fact that, unlike lying and scheming politicians, he entered with the sole intention of blowing up the House of Lords.
</li><li> The very few portrayals of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boudica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boudica">Boudica</a> and historical writings tend to paint her as a native freedom fighter opposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> Romans, and in Britain some see her as a National Hero (she ranked #35 in Greatest Britons), while feminists see her as a victim of abuse reacting against a cruel patriarchy. The fact that she systematically mass murdered tens of thousands by killing every man, woman, and child in the cities of Colchester, London, and St. Albans is at times glorified as an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDeadlyThanTheMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDeadlyThanTheMale">More Deadly Than the Male</a> (by the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> who invokes her positively in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FromHell">From Hell</a>). There is even a statue of Boudica outside Colchester built specifically to honor the revolt, despite the fact that there is a layer of ash and rubble underneath it from all the buildings she and her forces burnt. These gruesome atrocities are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide">downplayed</a> or even treated as justified on the basis that Roman soldiers raped her daughters - despite the fact that those civilians had nothing to do with it. Also ignored is the fact that her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street is extremely impressive from the Roman perspective (20,000 Romans held off 200,000 Bretons using nothing but discipline and determination [at least according to the Roman authors who recorded the rebellion]).
</li><li> Wyatt Earp, in portrayals such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDarlingClementine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDarlingClementine">My Darling Clementine</a></em> (1946) and <em>The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp</em> (1955), is portrayed as the paragon of the Western lawman. Even more modern takes like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone">Tombstone</a></em> still can't uncouple themselves entirely from this image. Earp's legend likely in part derives from the fact that he acted as an "adviser" on a number of early Western movies - he was good at branding himself. The reality is somewhat more complicated. As a US Marshal, Earp had authority to deputize others and serve arrest warrants, but on the other hand, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earp_Vendetta_Ride">Earp Vendetta Ride<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which took place after the attempted assassination and actual assassination of two of his brothers was a clear example of frontier justice, with Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and their deputized companions hunting down several outlaw Cowboys who they believed were responsible for the assassination and attempted assassination of his family members - a very clear conflict of interest. In the end, the Earp party arrested one, killed four men, and fled Arizona to escape murder charges. However, it was widely believed in Tombstone that the local authorities were corrupt and would never bring the outlaw Cowboys to justice, even if they committed murder. Many regarded the Earps as heroes who were standing up to cattle-rustling, murderous outlaws, and in the end authorities outside of Tombstone decided not to extradite the Earp party back there to face murder charges.
</li><li> Galileo Galilei is often seen as the man who proved that a Heliocentric model of outer space was correct, only to be declared a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic">heretic</a> and see his findings suppressed by the Catholic Church. This was not quite what happened. Many of his findings — his observation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Venus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Venus">Venus</a> had phases like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoon">The Moon</a>, for example — certainly cast doubt on geocentrism, but they didn't outright prove it incorrect. Galileo was convinced that heliocentrism was right, but he didn't have definitive, incontrovertible proof. One of the main issues was that he could not counter the strongest argument against it, one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> himself had put forth: the apparent lack of observable parallax shifts in the positions of the stars. What got the Church angry at him was not his belief in heliocentrism, but him saying it was true without definitive proof. Then Galileo doubled down, insisting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> be rewritten to conform with his theories, and later publicly insulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> and alienating the Jesuits, thus leading to the infamous trial. The Church never explicitly condemned him as a heretic, though it considered his behavior suspicious. While Galileo did make many important astronomical discoveries, and his writings are still considered masterpieces, presenting him as an innocent intellectual ruthlessly suppressed by overbearing religious authorities is one-sided and inaccurate. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics">Heresies and Heretics</a> for more details (he has his own folder).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart">King Richard I</a> of England has entered mythology as Richard the Lionheart, paragon of knighthood, King Arthur come again. The real Richard was a deeply complex individual: warlike, greedy (according to one story, Richard claimed he would <em>sell London</em> to finance his wars if he could find a buyer), <em>probably</em> not actually an Anglophone (his only interest in England aside from its revenues was that it afforded him the title of King), and not above stabbing someone in the back; this becomes a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryJones">Terry Jones</a> even claims that after he died records were calling him grasping and portraying him in a negative light, but John becoming the bad King means Richard changed back to being a good King. He did have a good sense of humor, being one of the few medieval kings of whom amusing quips are recorded. Not a cardboard villain, but not the cardboard angel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ivanhoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfRobinHood">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a></em> either.
<ul><li> Richard's reputation as one of the great kings of England is particularly odd as historians generally agree that he spent very little of his reign (as little as six months by some estimates) actually ruling England. Most of his time was spent on the Third Crusade, ultimately unsuccessful, in captivity in Austria (the ransom of which helped bankrupt England, ultimately contributing to the Baron's rebellion against King John and the signing of the Magna Carta) or defending his French possessions (Normandy, Brittany and Acquataine). He died in France and was buried there, not having been to England for the last five years of his life. Nevertheless in popular culture, as seen in various Robin Hood stories, he is consistently portrayed as a champion of England and one of the few kings known more by his epithet (Lionheart) than his regnal number. The one to portray him most realistically is the Ridley Scott Robin Hood movie in 2011, which not only has King John go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> against Eleanor of Aquitaine for supporting him constantly despite his many failures, but also brings up his atrocities on the Third Crusade such as the capture (and massacre of a large portion of) the city of Acre. However, he's still loved by many of his soldiers.
</li></ul></li><li> Saladin, Richard's opponent during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">Third Crusade</a>, also gets this treatment. During his lifetime, the Crusaders — especially Richard — considered him a "good Saracen" and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, a reputation he retained for centuries after his death. More recently, Arab nationalists have used him as a symbol of their struggle against the West, and Kurdish nationalists have also adopted his image. While Saladin was more tolerant and humane than one might expect of a figure from the Crusades, he wasn't always consistently so. For example, after the Battle of the Horns of Hattin, he ordered the summary execution of 200 Templars and Hospitallers at the hands of men unfamiliar with the use of weapons, causing them to die in agony. He put down a Sudanese revolt in Egypt by burning down their quarter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo">Cairo</a> with their women and children still inside their homes. After the Sudanese surrendered, he promised them safe passage up the Nile, only to have them massacred when they left Cairo in smaller, disorganized groups. When he besieged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jerusalem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he — by his own admission — intended to sack the city, only abstaining from doing so when the city's commander, Balian d'Ibelin, threatened to destroy the Muslim holy places and slaughter thousands of Muslim prisoners. Saladin, though hardly as bad as a number of other figures of the Crusades, was not quite as heroic as his reputation suggests.
</li><li> Traditionally, the Crusader (and first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem) Godfrey of Bouillon was idealized as the epitome of the virtues of the "Christian Soldier", to the point that he was considered one of the three Christian figures of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Worthies">Nine Worthies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the other two being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>). Now, to be fair, this is at least understandable to some extent. Godfrey was famous for his courage, piety, and (especially) humility, the latter of which is epitomized by his refusal to take the title of King of Jerusalem, saying the title belonged to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> and Him alone. Instead, he took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">relatively modest</a> title "Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre". On the other hand, Godfrey could be incredibly brutal, as shown by his being one of the leaders of a brutal large-scale massacre of Jews, Muslims and (possibly) Eastern Christians in Jerusalem after the city's capture.
</li><li> Lapu-Lapu, a Filipino tribal chieftain who ruled Mactan, is generally considered by modern Philippine society to be the first Filipino to fight back against attempted European colonial rule because he resisted an attack by Ferdinand Magellan and commanded the force that killed him. While it's hard to begrudge the man for defending his people and territory against invaders, calling him an anti-colonialist hero is a bit of a stretch. He wasn't fighting for the Philippines as a whole, only his own people; the Philippines as we know it is a relatively recent concept, and the archipelago was at the time made up of mostly unconnected tribal polities who fought wars against each other for whatever reason. Moreover, Magellan and his crew weren't necessarily interested in trying to impose Spanish rule on any part of the Philippines (if only because they knew it would be impractical with their lack of manpower), and spent most of their time there trying to get involved in the spice trade and converting people to Catholicism. Magellan's attack on Mactan was done not on behalf of the Spanish crown, but on behalf of another chieftan, Rajah Humabon, who at the time was one of Lapu-Lapu's enemies. The consensus among historians is that while Lapu-Lapu was hardly a bad person, his reputation as an anti-colonial hero is overblown.
</li><li> General Charles George Gordon, also known as "Chinese" Gordon or Gordon Pasha, was lionized as a hero in the late Victorian era, so much so, an entire expedition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRiverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRiverWar">The River War</a> was launched to "avenge" him after his death at the Siege of Khartoum in 1885. Novelists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, Andrew Mason (of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourFeathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourFeathers">The Four Feathers</a></em>) and the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Khartoum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Khartoum">Khartoum</a></em> glorified Gordon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> as an epitome of an English fortitude.
<ul><li> Gordon did possess important virtues as an officer (he was incorruptible, generally tried to ensure that his soldiers were well paid and had proper equipment) but he was also erratic and eccentric, prone to sudden and unexpected rages, harsh punishments and summary executions, and privately a religious fanatic. In contrast to his reputation as a British officer, Gordon built his fame and earned most of his honours as a mercenary for foreign governments, whether it's the Imperial Chinese government where he led the Ever Victorious Army to suppress the Taiping Rebellion, or the Khedivate of Egypt for whom he campaigned against the North African Slave Trade, albeit for the profit-driven motive of farming cheap (albeit free) labour for the lucrative ivory trade. Before he was called up to relieve Khartoum and oversee the retreat of the Egyptian forces in Khartoum, Gordon had accepted a contract to serve King Leopold's government in the Congo, and it was largely on account of self-promotion and his media reputation, that the British government sent him to Khartoum.
</li><li> Regarding his activities in China with the Ever Victorious Army, he can't even claim that. The Ever Victorious Army was actually created and led by an American Mercenary, Fredrick T. Ward. Ward and his lieutenant Li Hongzhang were able to integrate western style tactics, training and very fast light infantry units which were the reasons for its success. After years of leading the army, Ward died in battle and was subsequently replaced by Gordon, who only led the army for at most two years. Gordon's successes were due entirely to Ward's prior training and tactics being ingrained in the army. However, Gordon's horrible treatment of the Army caused massive desertions. After only 9 months under Gordon, desertions reduced the army from 5,000 to a fraction of its former self. It was so bad that Gordon had to resort to essentially press gang prisoners to fill the gaps. Less than a year later, the army was composed nearly entirely of press ganged "recruits." The ineffectiveness of the Ever Victorious Army was so prominent that Imperial army ordered it to be disbanded. And yet somehow, Gordon earned the name "Chinese" from this whole mess.
</li><li> That being said, however, Gordon's harsh treatment of his men was completely necessary as the members of this Ever Victorious Army were essentially thugs and bandits who would loot, pillage and rape at the slightest chance. Indeed, he even tried to prevent this harsh treatment by constantly ensuring his men were well payed, which infuriated many of the paymasters in the Imperial Army who would have preferred a more fiscally responsible method like pillaging towns. Gordon was disliked by many commanders in the Imperial army for his treatment of prisoners (they were upset that he didn't execute the spouses and children of rebels). Essentially, there is a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> influencing his reputation. While his successes in China may be misattributed to him in many ways, and he was certainly overly romanticized, his reputation is not entirely undeserved.
</li><li> At Khartoum, Gordon greatly exceeded his command and as biographers and later writers noted, he seemed to have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> hoping to drive the British to conquer Sudan (which the British govenrment did <em>not</em> want to do), repeatedly turning down requests to retreat from his impossible positions and refusing offers to leave by the leader of the Mahdist revolt with whom he exchanged letters. As a result of Gordon's actions, neither surrendering to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">The Siege</a> or withdrawing from his position as per his original commands, he, his fellows soldiers and the entire garrison at Khartoum were murdered.
</li></ul></li><li> Ancient Athens and its system of direct democracy, in which citizens vote on legislation themselves, gets this reaction among many people frustrated with the shortcomings of modern representative democracy, feeling that a return to this system would go a long way in rooting out political corruption. This ignores the fact that Athenian democracy had many traits that would be regarded as extremely undemocratic today, including permitting slavery and restricting the vote to male property-holders (a tiny minority of the population), and that a system that worked for one city would likely be unwieldy at best for a modern country with millions of citizens.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusJuniusBrutus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusJuniusBrutus">Marcus Junius Brutus</a>:
<ul><li> Plutarch wrote in his book of historical biographies, <em>Parallel Lives</em>, that Brutus was the last great republican. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> saw him as a man who died for the Republic's interests. For a long time the prevailing opinion among liberal-minded intellectuals that Brutus was a shining paragon of republicanism and Caesar a grasping tyrant. In the age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a>, intellectuals across England, France and America claimed Brutus as a proto-revolutionary hero while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a>' famous anti-fascist production of Shakespeare's play portrayed Brutus and the conspirators as proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>.
</li><li> Much of this portrayal derives in large part from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> getting a hero upgrade courtesy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRepublicEvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRepublicEvilEmpire">Good Republic, Evil Empire</a> dichotomy that existed during the struggle of Europe against the monarchy. This naturally led to some facts being elided. Namely that Brutus was in fact an <em>optimate</em>, a member and defender of the aristocratic senate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero">Cicero</a>'s letters note that Brutus was a vicious moneylender who charged poor supplicants exorbitant interest, far more than other optimates. The idea of Brutus as a defender of conservative order against a popular reformer (which was how Caesar started out) underpinned John Wilkes Booth's citation of Brutus as an inspiration for killing Lincoln, but it rarely colors the discourse of most adaptations. Michael Parenti's book <em>The Assassination of Julius Caesar</em> goes into detail about this (including that Cicero apparently was the equivalent of a cruel slum lord) and Caesar was more in line with modern leftist values regarding how he treated the poor (proposing land reforms, for instance) which drew the ire of the optimate faction.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/acans/caesar/CivilWars_Libertas.htm">Archaeological discoveries have found coins with Brutus' name and likeness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> commemorating Caesar's assassination with the word Libertas on it. Putting the face and name of a living Roman on coinage was in the Republican era, a mark of autocracy, as was more or less glorifying the death of a fellow Roman (which is what the conspirators accused Caesar of doing in a triumph where he celebrated Cato's death). It was moroever illegal and the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat">Pompey the Great</a> started doing it, followed later by Caesar himself, and now Brutus, complicates the traditional view of Brutus as a principled statesman and preserver of norms. If nothing else, the existence of these coins does mean that the reluctant vacillating figure in Shakespeare's play was not true and that Brutus did have some amount of ambition and saw himself as the Leader of the conspirators, and was certainly acknowledged as such. Ultimately, he might have died a Republican before living long enough to be a Dictator or Emperor.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution">Mexican Revolution</a> figure Pancho Villa is a frequent recipient of this treatment. It's true that he was a talented and accomplished man who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> and genuinely wanted to help the less fortunate. But that didn't make him a saint, even if some of the people he fought against were hardly likable. Villa had his share of atrocities, such as personally shooting a woman who blamed him for her husband's death and a priest who begged him to show mercy to some villagers. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> administration shifted its support from Villa and his allies to the Carranza government, his forces massacred eighteen American citizens, and he later ordered a cross-border raid into the United States that destroyed the New Mexican town of Columbus.
</li><li> Depictions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GuanYu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GuanYu">Guan Yu</a> tend to gloss over his more questionable decisions before his downfall and/or tone down his arrogance, making him into an embodiment of righteousness and loyalty.
</li><li> This trope can happen to animals as well as humans. In the popular imagination, Balto was the greatest hero of all the dogs who participated in the 1925 Nome serum run. While he did play an important role (being the lead dog of the sled team that completed the last leg of the run), his leg of the relay wasn't the longest or the most dangerous. Historical consensus is that another dog named Togo led the team played the most important part in the run and faced the greatest challenges, but he's far more obscure today than Balto.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> is today widely viewed as a symbol of Arab dignity and an Egyptian national hero. To be sure, he did do quite a bit of good for his country and his people. Under his regime, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to things like housing and education, and Egypt underwent an economic boom and cultural flourishing. But while Egypt was prosperous, it was hardly what one would call free. Nasser was a very authoritarian leader who effectively held all governing power in the country and violated human rights. His autocratic style of leadership is generally believed to have had significant negative consequences for Egypt, such as the Egyptian involvement in the Six-Day War which saw Egypt lose at least ten thousand soldiers and (temporarily) the Sinai Peninsula. Nasser was also an anti-Semite who imprisoned and/or expelled much of Egypt's Jewish population and even expressed skepticism (if not outright denial) of the Holocaust in an interview with an East German newspaper. He may not have been an outright monster like some other Middle Eastern dictators, but he wasn't as good as he's frequently remembered either.
</li><li> Works about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> will often tend to cast Georges Danton as a moderate liberal revolutionary killed by the revolutionary excesses of the Reign of Terror. Danton was less enthusiastic about the Terror than many of the Jacobins, but unlike them he commanded huge respect and loyalty from the militant Parisian crowd, which was often even more extreme than the Jacobins. He was also quite corrupt, accepting bribes from foreign diplomats and lived a lavish lifestyle during a time of wartime deprivation and wide starvation. He was also quite willing to use violence to get what he wanted and it was him, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>, who built the instruments of the Terror: the Revolutionary tribunals and the Committee of Public Safety, justifying it by saying that "let us be terrible so that people don't have to be."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> was scapegoated during her own lifetime for royalist excess. Cartoons in her lifetime depicted her as an airhead who does not realize that cakes and bread are made of the same grain, to a decadent noble who spends all her time and state money on partying and dresses while callously ignoring the suffering of the people, or someone willing to expend money on a Diamond Necklace. Yet after she died, she became a sentimental favorite for French Restoration Royalists (and through them, British and American pop culture), where many saw her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a> and became a scapegoat for a misogynist barbarian mob, which has infected most depictions of her since then:
<ul><li> Now, it is a fact that all of the above caricatures and rumors were false. They were deliberately so since Pre-Revolutionary satirists were prevented from making direct criticisms of the state, but indirectly they could attack it by discrediting it and Antoinette proved ideal for it, since her genuine clueless nature and clumsiness made her an easy mark. She was kind to her servants and favorites, and would dole out charity, and not cruel at all. She was a young woman who was unprepared at becoming a queen (she was the youngest of several daughters, but her older sisters died of smallpox with one exception, who ended up with facial scars) and tried to cope with things the best she could. She wasn't as excessive as other French aristocrats and there was more than a little xenophobia in mocking the Austrian Woman and her trial was misogynistic even by the standards of her time.
</li><li> Having said all that, recent films and books about her go so far to the other direction that they can only be called hagiographic, with some even claiming her as a fashion icon and feminist symbol. Before the Revolution, Antoinette's attitude was more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlummingIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlummingIt">Slumming It</a>, dressing up as an Arcadian peasant in "simple" clothing (which was actually incredibly expensive). She also made excessive demands for silk and expected it at a cheap rate that Lyon's textile industry was badly affected by her. Likewise, Antoinette largely cared about her station, rank and privilege, and that of her children, and she wasn't exactly fond of the Woman's March to Versailles and didn't have much very sympathy for the poor Parisian market women complaining about expensive bread and royal indifference. So while she did not say "Let them eat cake" and wasn't literally like the caricature of the time, the fact is that she could be just as obnoxious, callous and contemptuous of the poor as any aristocrat of her rank and station was and the people making fun of her with cartoons and rumors, weren't entirely wrong about the kind of person she was.
</li><li> During the Revolution, Antoinette proved to be quite a formidable and ruthless political operator. She played a major role in some of the incredibly terrible decisions made by her husband <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI</a> more or less enabling his paranoia and indecisiveness. She became the leader of the reactionary faction after 1789, urging Louis XVI to avoid compromise and accommodation with the new revolutionary order and attempting to manipulate Mirabeau to divide the revolutionaries. Moreover, she embezzled the Civil List to support the reactionaries and may have encouraged her brother Emperor Leopold II to invade France, which would have made her guilty of treason and indeed historians such as Timothy Tackett and David A. Bell do believe that she was a traitor, someone who knowingly provoked the 1792 War in the hope that France would lose and the neighboring Kingdoms would restore the French Monarchy.

In actual fact, he frequently engaged in rape and torture of servants and other working-class women, and it was largely because of that, rather than his writings and political ideas, that he was repeatedly imprisoned.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Dessalines">Jean-Jaques Dessalines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a leader of the Haitian Revolution and one of the first independent rulers of Haiti. He crowned himself Emperor in 1804, and proceeded to rule Haiti with an iron fist. In that same year he led his army to every city on the Haitian side of the island and gave his soldiers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">explicit orders to kill every single white French civilian</a>, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">their children</a> and any French woman who wouldn't marry one of his soldiers. Dessalines made a point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYoureSoEvilEatThisKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYoureSoEvilEatThisKitten">insisting that mixed-race soldiers to take part in the massacre</a> so the blame wouldn't fall entirely upon Haiti's black population, and he would lure any survivors out of hiding with false promises of amnesty. He didn't even try to hide what he did, bragging about it by stating "For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!". By the time the massacre was completed, 3000 - 5000 defenseless civilians were dead. After the massacre, Dessalines forced all black citizens on the island to either serve in his army or work on the plantations. Unsurprisingly, he became unpopular and was assassinated by his own followers just two years into his reign and was reviled by Haitians for the rest of the 19th century because of his autocratic ways. However in the 20th century onward, many Haitians decided that his role in winning their country's independence excused his atrocities. Currently a Haitian City and the Haitian National Anthem are both named after him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc">Jeanne d'Arc</a></em>, of course, does this to Joan of Arc. Another, more peculiar example lies in Gilles de Rais, who was an infamous serial killer in real life, but here he is one of Joan's most steadfast allies. By all accounts he WAS a loyal French royalist AND a savage, possibly, Satanic murderer. The two aren't incompatible. That, and there is no small amount of dispute over WHEN his murders started.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>'s <em>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">by the Sieur Louis de Conte</a></em>, which Twain called his favorite of all his books, is a rare example of near-total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmFailure">Sarcasm Failure</a> on Twain's part, being a straight, starry-eyed depiction of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a> and her noble death at the hands of evil. A lot of people called him out on this, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, who kept Joan the traditional heroine in his play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SaintJoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SaintJoan">Saint Joan</a></em>, but felt that her enemies had been the victims of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> and opted for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAndGreyMorality">White-and-Grey Morality</a> in his version of events. Quite incorrectly, however, as regards Peter Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who <em>was</em> a swine.
</li><li> It should be noted that it is possible (and in fact most likely) that Joan of Arc never knew that Gilles de Rais was a serial killer. In any case, the fact that he is often forgotten completely is evidence of historical hero upgrade.
</li><li> It is worth noting that it is a commonly held theory that Gilles de Rais was innocent. The Duke of Brittany, who was the person given the authority to prosecute the case, was also the one to receive all of Gilles de Rais' titles and lands after the conviction. In addition, none of the physical evidence brought forth was particularly tied specifically to Gilles de Rais, the confessions were forced under torture and threat of excommunication, the only accomplices that were punished were servants despite the claim that other nobles were involved, the confessions had very different methods cited, and there were a range of other charges added on top of the murders with little to no attempt to justify this. Regardless of his guilt or innocence, he was known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies and his violent nature on the battlefield.

Pretty much inverted by the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Elisabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Elisabeth">Elisabeth</a></em>, which presents her as so damaged and unstable that she spends her <em>entire adult life</em> hallucinating that Death (in the form of a beautiful young man) is trying to seduce her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s heroic upgrade has been zig-zagged throughout American history. Columbus became a celebrated figure in early American history as an enlightened and heroic explorer who convinced Europe that the Earth is round by discovering America. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WashingtonIrving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WashingtonIrving">Washington Irving</a>'s lionizing biography <em>A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus</em> significantly contributed to this narrative. These misconceptions permeated American pop culture to the point that they were often taught to children as fact, and Columbus Day was established to celebrate the man as a hero. However, growing backlash against Columbus over the past two or three decades has completely flipped the narrative, often portraying him as a hilariously incompetent moron and genocidal maniac. This is also untrue. Ultimately Columbus was a complicated figure. While his voyages did suffer from miscalculations and misconceptions, he was not an idiot and did ultimately open up the New World to European exploration. His governorship could be cruel to the native population, especially by modern standards, but he was not a bloodthirsty psychopath, particularly for his era.
</li><li> New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange got this treatment for several reasons. The most famous reason was his standing up to the Reagan administration and banning nuclear ships from New Zealand's ports. It made him a hero of the anti-nuclear movement, but in fact Lange was not an especially ardent believer in disarmament. The Labour Party also fondly remembers him (likely due to his charisma and amazing sense of humor), but they tend to gloss over the fact that the policies of his Finance Minister Roger Douglas (who is persona non grata in Labour circles today) ended up splitting the party and destroying his government.
</li><li> Matthias Corvinus ruled Hungary with an iron fist. He was known for imprisoning the nobles who crowned him king, and instituting high taxes to maintain his army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>. Despite this, he is known as Hungary's greatest and most iconic folk hero, for his sense of justice and his rumoured habit of mingling with the common folk. The fact that the kingdom of Hungary was living its golden age during his rule, and practically died with him, also helps his case.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesseJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesseJames">Jesse James</a>. American film and media portray him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">Robin Hood</a> figure of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a> thanks to the popularity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimeNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimeNovel">Dime Novels</a> in the late 19th century. In reality, he started his career as a pro-slavery bushwacker serving under the terrorists William Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson, and willingly participated in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia_Massacre_(Missouri)">Centralia Massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where 24 Union soldiers were scalped and dismembered. He robbed medicines intended for the sick and unhealthy, and was known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser">dressing up as a woman</a> (because he was handsome enough to be a really convincing one), seducing unionists to a brothel and then shanking and shanghaing his targets. The myth of Jesse James was in fact a PR Stunt developed by anti-Reconstruction journalists since his targets were Unionists and Union Republicans. Almost no movie deals with this, even something like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a></em> avoids dealing with the political baggage of James' crimes, or his early life, and the fact that his family were slaveowners.
</li><li> Much like Jesse James above, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker have been romanticized as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">dashing outlaw lovebirds</a> to the point that it's easy to forget that their "flaunting of society's rules" left a <em>lot</em> of dead bodies in its wake, both police and civilian. As a rule, criminals generally don't get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">four machine guns emptied into their bodies in an ambush</a> without a <em>very</em> good reason, and that was because they were considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>. They gunned down civilians at the mere hint of resistance, killed several police officers in unprovoked shootings, and often robbed small stores instead of banks, with one instance leading to Clyde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">beating and shooting an unarmed shopkeeper dead for $60</a>. Historians now believe the motivation for the crime spree was Clyde seeking revenge against society for his 2 year stay in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">infamously brutal</a> Eastham Prison Farm, and not anger against banks as popularized in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BonnieAndClyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BonnieAndClyde">the 1967 film</a> based on the pair.

He is often seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">hero figure who represents civil disobedience, rebellion, and freedom</a>. Less known is the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized">Che oversaw the Revolutionary Tribunals in La Cabana that killed hundreds of people</a>, a fact which he admitted several times, without any shame or remorse whatsoever. He also expressed his desire to nuke the United States (and was angry that Russia didn't), even though he knew it would kill millions of people. Scholarly assessments of Guevara's virtues and flaws is more mixed than the pop culture version, with the exception of works like Spain Rodriquez' graphic biography (which is pro-Che) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSoderbergh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSoderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a>'s biopic (which is detached but not entirely critical).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a> in general and Jacques de Molay, their last Grand Master, in particular. Thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAccursedKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAccursedKings">The Accursed Kings</a></em> of Maurice Druon for adding to this. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">executing every member of the order</a> is horrific and on top of that was done for overtly corrupt reasons (King Philip IV of France owed the Templar Order a lot of money, and decided to eliminate his debt by eliminating the Templars), this does not mean that the Knights Templar were saints. It was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>, which some treat like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>. Russian bard "Chancellor Gi" wrote a mocking song <em>The plea of Jacques de Molay</em> about the dead Templar worrying how he's going to be canonized, and remembering details such as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">bastards</a> and shifty way of his ascension to the chair.

In fact, most of them believed blacks to be inferior to whites, but also thought it wrong to enslave them anyway.

This view glosses over his ownership of slaves<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f9tq');"><sup>For example </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0f9tq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f9tq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He inherited ten slaves from his father and one hundred more from his wife.

He was given direct orders <em>not to attempt this</em>. He did it anyway, and succeeded on sheer miracle alone.</span>, his brutal and highly successful campaigns against the Native Americans while leading a portion of the Virginia Regiment, an embarrassing friendly fire incident during the Forbes Expedition to take Fort Duquesne, and the little fact that he kinda sorta ignited the French and Indian War (which led to the tax laws that Parliament passed to pay veterans of the war, which led to the unrest that resulted in the American Revolution) by ambushing a French patrol, leading to the Battle of Jumoville Glen. Whoops. Is it any wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams">John Adams</a> referred to him as "Old Muttonhead"? Even the ideas that Washington was some kind of naive humble hero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus">Cincinnatus</a> belies the fact that much of this reading comes from propaganda that Washington himself spread about him. In truth, he was a highly ambitious man (he blatantly campaigned to get the Continental Congress to appoint him as the commanding general), an adept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert">political operator</a>, who was quite good at putting on airs of non-partisanship while passing the buck of the actual policy-making and the stigma of association to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and others. His farewell speech which is often invoked out-of-context as a warning about the dangers of forming political parties and partisanship was contextually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to Thomas Jefferson and his rivals, in other words, Washington <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">in warning about non-partisanship was actually acting in a partisan manner</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> is an especially difficult figure to pin down one way or the other, mainly due to the contrast between his well known writings and his personal life (a well known biography of him is titled "American Sphinx"). This is the same person who penned "All men are created equal" while owning slaves after all. He is also known to have written long discourses on how not only were black people inferior, but also horribly ugly and repellent, while at the same time carrying on an affair with a slave.
</li><li> An interesting case from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> is Paul Revere. While he played a role in building the alarm system, he actually never made it to his destination during his Midnight Ride (only Samuel Prescott arrived in Concord). Revere was caught by a British patrol and detained. In fairness, however, his connections and people skills did help raise the alarm quicker than it otherwise might have been. After Lexington and Concord, Revere tried his luck as an artillery officer in the Massachusetts militia, but his only direct confrontation with the British was the Penobscot Expedition, after which he was court-martialed (and some say he was only acquitted of all charges because the state of Massachusetts needed to pin all the blame on the Continental Navy, otherwise they would have been bankrupt). However, Revere is nowadays remembered as one of the great heroes of the Revolution, mostly due to the poem by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWadsworthLongfellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWadsworthLongfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> (and his name rhyming with "hear"...).
</li><li> Patrick Henry is widely celebrated in the United States for his "give me liberty or give me death" speech in 1775 to the Second Virginia Convention, advocating that Virginia militia troops be sent to join the rebellion. What gets little attention is his deeply hypocritical position on slavery. While he spoke out against slavery several times and compared British actions leading up to the revolution to enslavement of the colonies, he also owned many slaves himself and did <em>not</em> (unlike several other slave owners who were ambivalent about or outright opposed to to the institution of slavery) ever free any of his slaves or leave provisions in his will to do so after his death. He seemingly thought that banning the international slave trade would cause slavery to eventually die out, but gave no thought to those who would remain enslaved in the meantime and was hostile to the idea of freeing slaves from their current owners. In 1787-1788 when campaigning against the adoption of the US Constitution (which he believed would give the new federal government too much power), he even argued to Virginia slave owners that they should oppose it because the federal government would free their slaves.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to many biographies written about American presidents, along with multiple varying portrayals in the media and the concept of American exceptionalism, this trope is pretty much inevitable and very common with many of the more well-liked presidents in American history; some examples include:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a> is seen in portrayals as a war hero and a populist badass who loved his wife dearly and stood up for the people against the wealthy elite. A website like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> despite being critical and debunker of myths also indulges in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> glorification. However this overlooks his responsibility for the Trail of Tears and Indian Removal that forced many Native Americans (some of whom had been his allies in the War of 1812) from their lands and caused many to die in the process, even after the Supreme Court had ruled against the tactic. Jackson's disregard for this Supreme Court ruling flouted the concept of checks and balances in the Constitution, and further exacerbated Native American relations with the federal government. Many of his policy decisions as president came about because of personal grudges rather than sound policy, such as destruction of the Second National Bank (dislike of Nicholas Biddle) and his actions against South Carolina-based State Nullification (dislike of John C. Calhoun, whom at one point he threatened to behead) — and like the Trail of Tears actions, showed him overstepping Constitutional authority. His actions against the Second National Bank were instrumental in bringing on the Panic of 1837, which destroyed his protege <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren">Martin Van Buren</a>'s presidency and wrecked the economy. His "spoils system" saw nearly 1000 career government officials lose their jobs in favor of political cronies who had supported him regardless of their fitness to hold office. Concepts such as an imperial approach to the presidency and dysfuntionality in the party system (both significant and ongoing problems with US politics) have their roots in Jackson's political thinking. Prior to his presidency, Jackson had set up martial law to govern New Orleans near the end of the War of 1812; when he refused to lift this status after the war ended, he arrested a state senator and district court judge who had objected to the concept of open-ended martial law for the city. Not surprisingly, he had a terrible temper and fought duels at the drop of hat, an estimated 100 in all, killing at least one man. Unlike several early presidents who owned slaves, Jackson not only owned them but actively engaged in slave trade; while president, he tried to force the Postal Service to prohibit mail distribution of Abolitionist material. Early biographers tend to ignore or downplay Jackson's issues with slavery.

That being said, popular culture and even quite a few historians have painted a more unambiguously good picture of him than he actually was. What a lot of people forget is that he wasn't always committed in his abolitionism. Earlier on, he opposed slavery's expansion westward, but wasn't a wholehearted supporter of interfering with slavery where it already existed. He also prioritized winning the Civil War over ending slavery, declaring in a letter to Horace Greeley that if he could save the Union without freeing a single slave, he would do it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mc0n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mc0n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mc0n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he <em>also</em> said if he could save the Union by freeing <em>all</em> the slaves he would do that, and if he could save it by freeing some and not freeing others he would do <em>that</em>; basically, the message was "I care more about preserving the Union than I care one way or the other about slavery"</span>. Like many other abolitionists, he was also a skeptic (and at times, even outright opponent) of racial equality, and even toyed with the idea of sending freed slaves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Liberia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Liberia">Liberia</a> as he saw them as nothing more than foreigners at the time. To be fair, though, his views on African-Americans did improve over time and came to embrace a greater ideal of equality by the end of his life, something Frederick Douglass commended him for. It's also generally forgotten that Lincoln undertook some rather authoritarian, regressive, and anti-democratic measures during the war, including shutting down several newspapers that were critical of the war effort, jailing the mayor of Baltimore without charges, and suspending the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, the latter of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">was also done by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JeffersonDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JeffersonDavis">Jefferson Davis</a>.

While this may be true, it overlooks his imperialistic tendencies in Cuba and the Philippines during the US wars there from the 1890s to the 1900s and his often boorish personal behavior. Like many people of his day, Roosevelt believed imperialism was good for "less civilized" nations, as being conquered would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">allow them to learn how to be "more civilized."</a> He was also an enthusiastic supporter of eugenics, again like many people of his time.

His economic policies during World War I precipitated double-digit inflation and a lengthy economic recession. Wilson's stubborn behavior doomed the success of the League of Nations he ardently championed; instead of negotiating with members of Congress who opposed it such as Henry Cabot Lodge, he unsuccessfully decided to drum up populist support for the idea. The USA resultantly never joined the organization. Like many of his presidential contemporaries, Wilson was an enthusiastic supporter of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America, sending troops into Mexico (twice), Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, and virtually turning Nicaragua into a US protectorate. Wilson's reputation rightly seems to have shifted in recent years, where he is looked on much more critically for exactly these reasons. In fact, some observers now consider him one of the worst US presidents of the early 20th century, <em>especially</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/AlternateHistoryDotCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/AlternateHistoryDotCom">AlternateHistory.com</a>. Some more hardline American conservatives, on the other hand, have long subjected Wilson to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> for his role in bringing about a permanent income tax and establishing the Federal Reserve Bank (those being some of the major reasons why many progressives gave him a Historical Hero Upgrade).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> is remembered fondly for guiding the United States through both the great Depression and WWII, however most people overlook his dark side. He made multiple attempts to seize greater power for the presidency and often worked behind the backs of the other branches of government to achieve his ends. In the court packing scheme for example, he drafted an executive order that would allow him to appoint additional Supreme Court judges to "assist" the many elderly judges on the court, which would essentially grant him control of the Supreme Court. Congress threatened to impeach him if he went through with it, as it violated the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary (expanding the court requires Congressional approval). The decision most people are appalled at is his authorization of Japanese-American internment on suspicion of espionage, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">even J. Edgar Hoover (notoriously xenophobic and racist in his own right) opposed</a>. Many people today also overlook his role in developing the Atomic Bomb, though in the case of the latter he has the benefit of the doubt since the decision and strategy to bomb Japan was undertaken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> alone, and supporters often wonder if Roosevelt would have ordered the dropping of the Bomb had he not died. In addition, conservatives tend to view his New Deal as actually a very bad deal, possibly prolonging the Depression<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17r56');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17r56" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17r56');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This claim is extremely controversial; among historians and economists it's virtually impossible to find anybody whose opinion on the subject isn't colored by their own political beliefs.</span> and creating unintended consequences that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">still felt today</a>. In recent years, many other aspects of Roosevelt's racial policies have come under scrutiny like his refusal to accept Jewish refugees during the Holocaust and how his welfare programs gave better housing and financial aid to White Americans, thereby leading to the racial inequality that continues to this day. He also initially supported the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan">Morgenthau Plan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which would have seen Germany's industrial capabilities almost completely stripped from her, and only turned against it after overwhelmingly negative public reaction to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> is often portrayed as an admirable and badass general in WWII and a great president who maintained stability in the early years of the cold war and warned of the Military-Industrial complex. While he could be seen as admirable and these portrayals deserve credit, they tend to overlook some of his shady foreign policy actions as president. The problem is that which actions you regard as shady depends on your own point of view. On one side Eisenhower is criticized for supporting various dictatorships like Batista's regime in Cuba and Ngo Dinh Diem's in South Vietnam as long as they remained <em>his</em> dictatorships, and for joining with the British in instigating a coup in Iran to remove the democratically elected government in favor of the absolute monarchy of the Shah (which in in the long run paved the way to the Islamic Revolution). On the other they accuse him of "backstabbing" American allies like Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Israel, in other words e.g. for refusing to do with Egypt what he did do with Iran and to unconditionally supporting the imperialism of his allies who in the case of the Suez crisis had tried to deceive him. Some also think that he should have come to the aid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryRefusal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryRefusal">the Hungarian and Polish rebels/strikers of 1956</a>, thereby risking starting World War III, but such a view is perhaps more popular among hawkish American cold warriors than elsewhere (in 1956 a nuclear war would primarily have affected Europe as the Soviet Union would only show they could build intercontinental missiles the following year). Despite signing a bill mandating voting rights for Blacks in 1957, Eisenhower was not an especially enthusiastic supporter of civil rights; that same year, he reluctantly sent troops to Little Rock to enforce <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em> and refused to take further action when Arkansas governor Orval Faubus closed all public schools a year later to circumvent Eisenhower.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> is often seen as the "last true president" of the United States and is seen in many circles as a president who saved the world from Armageddon and would have avoided Vietnam and saved America from &lt;insert Villainous secret society here that killed him in Conspiracy Theories&gt; had he lived. He is almost <em>canonized</em> (along with Andrew Jackson sometimes) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> circles as a pillar of moral character that stood against the "system". The fact that the "monolithic conspiracy" speech was probably a reference to Communism and the Soviet Union gets ignored, along with his professional and personal failings. A lot of his forays into international affairs were dangerous brinkmanship at best and disastrous at worst. Notably, failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion was caused by his ineffective and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">pointless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryRefusal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryRefusal">Cavalry Refusal</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fimu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fimu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fimu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Instead of either calling off the invasion entirely or providing the planned air support, he took the middle option of letting the invasion go through but not allowing the bombers to participate, which was the worst of all the options available to him.</span>, and the Cuban Missile Crisis was defused owing to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">even the Soviets were worried about</a> Castro and Che's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> claims about the nukes as it did to JFK's success. While Kennedy opposed military intervention in Vietnam, it was not because he was anti-war but because he felt that a war in Vietnam wouldn't be in America's interest. He also <em>did</em> send American military advisers to train the South Vietnamese Army, and it's entirely possible that this would've dragged him into the war anyway if any of those advisers got killed by North Vietnamese bombs. While not he wasn't as hawkish as the likes of Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon, Kennedy was still a hardline anti-communist who was willing to prop up anti-communist regimes and believed in the now-discredited domino theory, which claims that if one country fell to communism, the surrounding countries would follow. Domestically, Kennedy was not the egalitarian as many on the left assumed; as a congressman he supported legislation that would allow the surveillance of alleged communist sympathizers and as president he wasn't enthusiastic about openly supporting the civil rights movement despite his sympathies. If anything, it was his Texas-based vice president, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>, who became a far more vigorous civil rights advocate than Kennedy in theory and practice. Perception of JFK on the American left is significantly colored by his more liberal brothers Robert (who pressured John to support the civil rights movement and campaigned on that issue in this own presidential bid until his own assassination) and Ted (one of the most prominent liberals in the US Senate for 47 years), who were both more devoted than him to progressive causes. In his personal life, he was charismatic and charming but was also dishonest, cheating on his wife so frequently that he and his staff had to devise an alarm system to warn when she was nearby.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> is another US President who has been raised to heroic status for allegedly "ending the Cold War without a shot," as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> put it. He is fondly remembered by many people for giving the USA back its self-confidence after the embarrassment of Watergate, the Iran Hostage Crisis, and the loss of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration oversaw an economic policy that gave business people more freedom without government interference, which was a good thing for the rich (if perhaps no one else). It has gotten to the point that Reagan is seen as a lovable and morally incorruptible grandpa figure, which is a very romanticized image. For starters, Reagan was in fact very tough on Communism during the first years of his administration, actively wanting to put more nuclear missiles in Europe and even in space (the "Star Wars" project) just to be safe from possible USSR attacks but he moderated in response to the biggest anti-nuclear demonstrations of all time and learned to back down from his tough-talking approach, forming a friendship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MikhailGorbachev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MikhailGorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>. Likewise, Reagan led an extraordinarily corrupt US Administration with more officials imprisoned and dismissed from office under his tenure than any other, among the most notable being those involved with the Iran-Contra scandal. In addition, his handling of the AIDS Crisis led many LGBT activists to believe that his administration was either indifferent or outright hostile to them, actively leaving them to die and taking action only after straight people became affected. Reagan also appointed several cabinet directors because they reflected his viewpoints rather than for any competency issues in the field; one example was die-hard anti-environmentalist James G. Watt, who was named Secretary of the Interior. Reagan also controversially nominated Robert Bork for a Supreme Court vacancy, continuing to push for his appointment despite it creating bad blood with Congress, who had refused to approve Bork. In foreign policy, Reagan supported bad actors in El Salvador, the Nicaraguan Contras, and Apartheid South Africa, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">simply because they were anti-communist</a>. His 1994 admission that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease also brought speculation that he might have already been affected by the disease during his second term, during which he was often confused during cabinet meetings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ic4h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ic4h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ic4h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This speculation came in part from uncertainty as to when the diagnosis actually happened. However, Reagan survived until 2004, when the average life expectancy after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's is 9 years. If he already had Alzheimer's at the start of his second term, that means he lived with it for 20 years. While not impossible, that would be very rare.</span> Likewise, in 2019, a phone conversation between Reagan, when he was Governor of California, and President Nixon surfaced, in which Reagan said some pretty racially insensitive things about African delegates at the UN, hinting that in private Reagan may have held racist views, at least at that time.

They often say that he was the sole creator of his inventions, even when he was just improving on something that came before (alternating current, for instance). Or they gloss over his ideas that failed simply because they were completely unworkable (in many cases because he was simply mistaken about the physical laws of the universe, which were much less understood during his lifetime than they are now). Or they downplay some of Tesla's personal flaws such as his anti-Semitism, his support of eugenics, and his dismissal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a>.
</li><li> Fletcher Christian of the HMS Bounty mutiny is generally portrayed as a heroic, honorable man who stood up against Captain Bligh on behalf of the oppressed crew and ultimately led them to salvation and paradise on Pitcairn Island. This is not withstanding the fact that most historians agree that Bligh's tyrannical behavior has been greatly exaggerated (in fact, most accounts are that Bligh was <em>less</em> prone to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheLash">the severe physical punishments of the era</a> than most Royal Navy captains, preferring to simply ridicule subordinates with abusive language if they displeased him), and that it is hard for anyone who takes an objective reading of the accounts to regard Christian's actions as anything but purely selfish, he having even admitted to that after the mutiny. By his own claim, he simply could not handle being yelled at by Bligh any longer. Portrayals of the story conveniently gloss over several important facts. Regardless of Christian's personal feelings towards Bligh, he also sent 18 loyal crewmembers adrift with him, some of whom did not survive. Responsibility for their deaths has to rest at least partly on his shoulders. On the other hand, he also forced some men to remain on the ship against their will, content on never allowing them to return home. Christian's command of the ship after taking control was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">strict and somewhat abusive like Bligh before him</a>, resulting in over half of his band losing faith in his leadership and deserting him at Tahiti. Christian and his mutineers were also responsible for the massacre of dozens of natives on Tubuai Island while trying to clear space for a settlement, and most of the Tahitians who accompanied them to Pitcairn Island, were in fact kidnapped. On Pitcairn Island, Christian and his mutineers treated the Tahitian men like slaves, within a few years all of the Tahitian men and eight of the nine mutineers were dead, murdered by each other or revenge seeking widows.

Though it is true that the Red Army had the most to do with militarily defeating Germany, many works of fiction centered around them deem them the "heroes" of World War II who assisted in defeating the cruelest regime in history, while conveniently ignoring the <em>long</em> list of the Red Army's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory">crimes before, during, and after the war</a>.

To this day, he is remembered as one of the greatest leaders in Israeli history. Now, his reputation is at least partly deserved — his military leadership played a major role in the victory of the Jews in 1948, he had a large hand in his country's rapid development, and he firmly advocated against discrimination. But that's not to say he didn't have his flaws or commit questionable actions. His party, Mapai, often governed through rather corrupt and authoritarian means — such as firing teachers who voted for the wrong party (or even werent members of the workers association associated with the party) and bribing workers during elections. In his diaries, Ben-Gurion blamed all sorts of atrocities committed by the IDF in its early days (the most notorious case being <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Qasim_massacre">the massacre at Kafr Qasim<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) on Holocaust survivors <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4g9el');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4g9el" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4g9el');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Until the Eichmann trial, it was commonly assumed that Holocaust survivors tended to be immoral human beings, either because they survived through means that involved shafting other victims of the Nazis or because they were warped by their experiences in the camps</span>, when they were largely committed by Jews who were born and raised in Israel. Ben-Gurion also had a bad habit of exceeding his authority, such as ordering Operation Olive Leaves — an attack on Syrian fortifications in retaliation for repeated attacks on Israeli fishing vessels in the Sea of Galilee — without consulting the cabinet first.

Little attention is paid to his earlier separatism, his devotion to the increasingly corrupt Elijah Muhammad, his celebrations of major tragedies such as the Air France Flight 007 crash, his patriarchal attitudes regarding women, his vaguely anti-Semitic statements earlier on (which he never repudiated), and many of the stranger aspects of his earlier theology (which taught, for example, that Black people would be brought into heaven by a giant UFO). Not to mention that his break from the Nation of Islam is heavily romanticized, despite it being just as much a personal dispute between him and the Nation's leadership as it was an ideological one. And his conversion to Sunni Islam is often portrayed in an unambiguously positive light, glossing over the fact that his conception of Islamic orthodoxy was being fed to him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi</a> bigwigs, who may have been using him in a proxy war with their rival religious authorities in Egypt. Also, he had some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad">anti-capitalist views</a> that would be considered more acceptable today in light of economic crises and worsening social condition caused by neoliberalism. Of course, Malcolm being the polarizing figure that he is, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">opposite end of this trope</a> is just as common (if not more so).

<ul><li> This does lead to a fact that actual North Vietnamese war crimes are rarely depicted, nor is the fact that their government was a fairly typical hardline Communist one with most of the usual trappings thereof such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">mass executions</a> and nationalization of business by force.

After their victory, persecution of South Vietnamese in business and government occurred, plus repression of ethnic Chinese (many of whom were active in both fields).
</li><li> Genocides ensued where the Communists won, with hundreds of thousands of Montagnards, ethnic Chinese, Catholics, Hmong, Tay, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry">Mixed Ancestry</a> Vietnamese being murdered directly or via deprivations, and millions more either fleeing the country or being sent to concentration camps to quash resistance.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5bwb2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5bwb2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5bwb2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">More Boer War than World War II style, though.</span> Per the U.N., in the years following North Vietnam's victory, 1.65 million southern Vietnamese refugees<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6sdw8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6sdw8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6sdw8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Nearly 10% of the entire population.</span> fled and settled in other countries; per the U.S. High Commission Of Refugees, 0.75 million others died in their attempts to flee, usually at sea; and per the modern Hanoi government, over one million remaining people in the former RVN spent time in a reeducation camp. Despite this, they are remembered positively among the left of many countries because their repression didn't reach the numbers that it did in Communist China and the USSR (or at least historians don't believe it did, since a lot of the archives of that time are kept out of reach of neutral observers), and that the Vietnamese government did play a role in ending the Cambodian genocide, and they have historically fought the Imperialist French, the Hawkish Americans, the Communist Chinese, and as such living up to the nationalist freedom fighter image many on the American left foisted on them. This is also because many of the ideas about the Vietnamese (e.g. the American soldiers left behind in Vietnamese prison camps popularized by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboFirstBloodPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboFirstBloodPartII">Rambo: First Blood Part II</a></em>) are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">Dated History</a> and propaganda.
</li><li> The idea that they ended the Cambodian genocide is itself an example. It's <em>technically</em> true, but it fails to mention is that <em>they're the ones who installed the Khmer Rouge in the first place.</em> In March 1970, after years of giving shelter to the Khmer Rouge (who were unable to make much progress and had very few members at that point despite extensive support from China), the North Vietnamese Army directly invaded Cambodia (its pro-Hanoi monarch had been legally and constitutionally deposed by the National Assembly), smashed the majority of its army, occupied 40% of the country, and systemically dismantled the government institutions; they then handed over the land and populace they took to the Khmer Rouge along with more weapons and supplies. <em>Then</em> they took an active role in training and recruiting for the Khmer Rouge, to the point that the Cambodian communist insurgency grew from fairly irrelevant to possessing several tens of thousands of fighters in only two months following their invasion. All of this is openly admitted to in <em>Victory in Vietnam</em>, the PAVN's official war history. Not only did the PAVN invasion directly kick start a civil war that killed 300,000 people, it enabled Pol Pot's eventual victory, enabling him to go on his own genocidal campaign in which he slaughtered over 1,800,000 civilians. The North Vietnamese didn't care about this. The 1978-1979 Vietnamese-Cambodian War only happened because Pol Pot was ridiculously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> and had his troops invade Vietnamese land and massacre towns and villages after the Vietnam War ended. And while the Vietnamese counter-invasion <em>did</em> depose the Khmer Rouge and stop the genocide, it also kick started yet <em>another</em> civil war that killed <em>another</em> 300,000 people, over two thirds of whom were civilians.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note74328');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note74328" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note74328');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that this only count deaths due to violence; deaths due to war-related deprivations were likely higher.</span> Yet, for some reason, "expanding the war to Cambodia" is popularly laid at the feet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>, not the PAVN.
</li></ul></li><li> The IRA frequently gets this treatment in American works, where Irish-Americans even see them romantically. It is true that the Irish and Catholics were disenfranchised in the UK at the time, and the British Army and the RIC were unquestionably brutal during the Irish War of Independence. However, the IRA (or at least elements within it) were and still are notorious for attacking civilians, anti-Protestant violence, extortion and what we recognize today as classic terrorist tactics like street bombings and letter bombs. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, IRA splinter groups were notorious for gangland-style "punishment shootings", where they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kneecapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kneecapping">kneecap</a> people who they felt had crossed them or as a means of cracking down on crime, particularly drug dealing (despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">becoming involved with it themselves</a>).
</li><li> Sergeant Alvin C. York of the U.S. Army got this treatment, which he openly lampshaded, once he returned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. Famed for leading a small contingent of soldiers to victory with a <em>huge</em> number of enemy prisoners after the rest had been slaughtered by enemy fire, York immediately got a huge hero's treatment Stateside, which he complained against and tried to deny. Books were written making his exploits completely fantastic, and movies did the same, such as one of the earliest showing him single-handedly charge an enemy position with a pistol and killing a few dozen German soldiers, which he himself said <em>never happened</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8a6ev');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8a6ev" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8a6ev');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">What actually happened was that he ran out of ammo for his Enfield 1917 rifle during a tense firefight and switched to his 1911 to defend himself.</span> It should also be noted that York openly felt remorse for German soldiers he had killed and prayed for the dead Germans when he returned to the site of his feat.
</li><li> Vladimir I of Kyiv, a Rusian ruler credited with bringing Christianity to the country,is venerated as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church and as one of Rus best early leaders. He was also an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">abusive husband</a> even for his time, was involved in the murder of one of his brothers, and became Christian more because it was the most politically and militarily convenient thing to do at the time than genuine faith. He also coerced people to become Christians, warning they would be in trouble if they didn't.
</li><li> The Jacobite risings are usually framed as Scottish struggles to restore the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">Rightful King</a> and achieve independence from the English yoke; Bonnie Prince Charlie in particular is looked on as something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> by Scots nationalists. In reality, there were Jacobite minorities in England and Hanoverians in Scotland, and the English Parliament had deposed the Catholic James II for being too pro-French, not pro-Scottish. Furthermore, while the Stuarts certainly wanted to reclaim the Scottish throne, at the time still legally separate from England, they were probably more concerned with the richer and more powerful Kingdom of England. So, while there was certainly an element of nationalism among the Scottish Jacobites, the risings were more of a struggle between Britain's Protestant political elite and continental Europe's old Catholic nobility than the true king fighting to free his people.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUntouchables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUntouchables">Eliot Ness</a> is frequently depicted as a badass, incorruptible law officer who became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> after refusing to take a bribe from him. In reality Ness had little to do with Capone's conviction, and Capone might have only barely been aware Ness even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">existed</a></em>. Capone probably considered whoever was in charge of the North Side gang as his archnemesis; Ness' ten-man crew could barely scratch his million dollar bootlegging empire. Ironically for a man best known for fighting bootlegging, he also became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholic</a> later in life. When a federal building was slated to be named after him, a critic argued that it might as well be named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a> is often invoked as a free-speech dissident icon on both the Right and the Left, citing his warnings about Stalin's totalitarian regime and calling out his fellow leftists for their blind support of communism, which was certainly a valid point in the 30s and 40s. However, this has led to an ironic secular canonization (of the kind that Orwell himself criticized) where everyone assumes that because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">Orwell was right about Stalin, he was right about everything</a>. Nor do they appreciate that an author who wrote about the deceptiveness of language and mendacity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">was himself prone to exaggeration and outright lying</a>, famously lying about "shooting an elephant" during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedAnimalRampage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedAnimalRampage">Escaped Animal Rampage</a>, exaggerating his tony years as a student at Eton into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors">Boarding School of Horrors</a> when in fact he was a pampered favorite of the headmaster and headmistress<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note96pgq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note96pgq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note96pgq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If anything, as a prefect who ratted out students he thought were homosexuals, Orwell was arguably the most horrific part of the boarding school to his fellow students, and his later essay is an obvious example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection">Psychological Projection</a></span>. He also used anti-communism as a platform for partisan mudslinging about issues that he was misinformed about (as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HomageToCatalonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HomageToCatalonia">Homage to Catalonia</a></em>), and finally at the same time as he wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>, he was compiling a list of suspected communists for the Ministry of Information, calling the likes of Paul Robeson "anti-white", saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> was Jewish, and so on. His private diaries reveal that Orwell was a homophobe and an anti-semite, and generally speaking, not a very nice person regardless of the value of his essays and writings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lampiao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lampiao">Lampião</a> is venerated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a> in Brazil and often depicted in media as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">Robin Hood figure</a>: an outlaw that robbed the rich and gave it to the poor and dished out personal justice in the hard Northern Backlands, where the law could be bought by the rich. The reality was that he was a brutal and ruthless bandit that extorted people for huge amounts of money to not raid their towns and performed many horrible atrocities such as rapes, murders, castrations and branding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">send out as message</a>. Despite this, his memory is still fondly remembered in the Brazilian Northeast because of the idea he represented as a man standing up against the corrupt and taking up law in his own hands.
</li><li> Spartacus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">Doomed Moral Victor</a> of the last known great slave revolts in Rome is constantly portrayed a hero, especially in the modern era from the 1700s onwards (before he was either unmentioned or forgotten). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Someone who fought for the freedom of fellow slaves cannot help but be considered a heroic figure to modern eyes</a>.
<ul><li> Since most of the history we have comes down from Roman sources, we have no sure way of gauging what his motives were, which allows many authors to lend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Applicability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Applicability">Applicability</a> to his life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> called him the greatest hero of the Ancient World, and communists and leftists always saw him as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion">Icon of Rebellion</a> and a forerunner to later revolutionaries and uprisings (for instance Toussaint L'Ouverture was called the "Black Spartacus" and John Brown was also considered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo">Victor Hugo</a> to be an American Spartacus). Their last stand at the hands of Roman Legions led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusLiciniusCrassus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusLiciniusCrassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>, after which many of them were crucified on the Appian Way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">Make an Example of Them</a> lionized them as a martyr for freedom thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus">Spartacus</a></em> (and its iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">I Am Spartacus</a> moment) and the more recent TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a></em>.
</li><li> Historians, especially those who tend to subscribe to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRepublicEvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodRepublicEvilEmpire">Good Republic, Evil Empire</a> in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> (which is what Spartacus fought against and hypothetically was out to topple) qualify this, since seeing Spartacus as a hero makes the republicans that clamped him down evil (a position that many on the left wholly accept), and they oppose retrofitting contemporary attitudes to abolitionism on to a past where slavery was more or less considered normal by every society, be it Roman or non-Roman. They note that there is no evidence that Spartacus was seeking abolitionism of all slavery in Rome and in fact there is evidence of the very opposite (Spartacus' band composed of rural slaves and as such they tended to attack urban slaves who were loyal to their masters in the towns they attacked). There is no evidence that Spartacus had revolutionary intentions of toppling the Republic, with most arguing that the escaped slaves were merely runaways seeking to escape to freedom or at best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland">Fighting for a Homeland</a>. Of course, this would not, by itself, cancel out the revolutionary nature and example of Spartacus' story for his defenders, but fundamentally Spartacus and his story ultimately speaks to attitudes of the eighteenth and twentieth centuries rather than reveal anything about the Ancient World in general, and Rome in particular.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanadaYukimura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanadaYukimura">Sanada Yukimura</a> is often celebrated as a folk hero for his legendary skills as a warrior and has always received a near universally positive portrayal in any work he is in as a youthful samurai with undying loyalty to Takeda Shingen and later Hideyoshi Toyotomi. His last stand at Osaka is always played straight, depicting a tragic fight to serve his lord no matter the cost as he made his suicidal charge to face Tokugawa. Such efforts have immortalized in him games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em> and <em>Sanadamaru</em>. Additionally, Yukimura tends to become an icon to oppose the Tokugawa whenever the writers felt like giving a middle finger to the Shogunate, which was not that uncommon when the shogunate began to weaken somewhere after 200 years of its foundation, because of the reasons above. Even works that are pro-Tokugawa will always portray him as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> at worst, being an affable model soldier and the pinnacle of the romanticized soldier of honor who could become great friends if it weren't for the war situation or that he's on the opposing side of the Tokugawa.
</li><li> Another anti-Tokugawa icon often used to counter against the shogunate was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IshidaMitsunari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IshidaMitsunari">Ishida Mitsunari</a>, who was often praised as the one who tried his damndest to protect the legitimate legacy of the one who actually unified Japan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> on almost the same caliber to Yukimura above and perhaps one of the brains for Yukimura's brawn. There are many pro-Ishida, anti-Tokugawa portrayals that skipped out the fact that Mitsunari was quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to his subordinates, admonishing them for their performance at the Korean Campaign while he also participated in that blunder, and he resorted to several dick moves to win support at Sekigahara (one such infamous attempt was his plan to blackmail the Hosokawa clan by holding the wife of the leader, Hosokawa Gracia, hostage. That backfired when Gracia planned out her suicide with her retainer despite her new Christian faith not allowing her to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">Seppuku</a> anymore, which made <em>her</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> instead and Hosokawa Tadaoki changed his mind about joining him and joined Ieyasu and the East faction instead)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a> tends to get this whenever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonKingNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonKingNobunaga">Demon King Nobunaga</a> trope is in effect. As a devout Buddhist that was quite troubled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>'s biggest atrocity that is the burning of Mt. Hiei, Mitsuhide is often regarded as someone who has the high moral ground and his betrayal at Honnoji was considered the hand of justice finally making Nobunaga pay for his atrocities. In the actual history, however, Mitsuhide wasn't acting out of karma, he just did the betrayal out of nowhere for vague reasons that no one even knows even today. One thing for sure was that Nobunaga was <em>that close</em> to unify Japan, which might be what the commonfolk wanted, and yet Mitsuhide's betrayal prolonged it, which made some people think that his death by peasants after being defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> counted as his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>.
</li><li> Another person commonly raised to oppose Nobunaga was his brother-in-law, Azai Nagamasa. If Nobunaga is the demon, then Nagamasa is often raised to the status of the champion of tradition, almost to white knight levels, and his betrayal of Nobunaga at Kanegasaki was often portrayed as a just thing because Nobunaga was an invasion-happy ass. It also helps that Nagamasa was surprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> with Nobunaga's sister Oichi, so white-knighting Nagamasa became a more plausible reason to condemn Nobunaga as a home-wrecker for his own kin. The actual history was much harsher: During the betrayal at Kanegasaki, there was no moral high ground but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> for Nagamasa; betray Nobunaga and he would be condemned as an oathbreaker for his marriage with Oichi (which also means his dignity as a daimyo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> and clan alliance were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> back then), betray the Asakura and he would also be condemned as betraying their long tradition of alliance, while it put Nagamasa in a tragic situation, that doesn't always guarantee him the moral high ground. And outside that, Nagamasa could prove himself to be ruthless to those that became his prisoners, there were reports that he harshly crucified his prisoners or Christian ones (foreign religion was heavily ostracized by the old tradition back then), which wouldn't fly well with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> propaganda image.
</li><li> Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia, is generally fondly remembered as a strong and intelligent ruler who centralized and modernized the country, actively fought the slave trade, and prevented Ethiopia from being colonized through a combination of skillful diplomacy and military victories. In the process, however, he engaged in some truly appalling brutality. Over the course of his campaigns to unite Ethiopia and expand its territory, his armies engaged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">atrocities similar to those committed by many of the European colonial powers</a>, including torture, massacres, and the mistreatment of civilians. The Dizi, Kaffa, and Oromo peoples were especially hard-hit, with many among the latter considering his actions tantamount to genocide. Also, while he tried to suppress the slave <em>trade</em>, he wasn't an abolitionist; in fact, he and his third wife Taytu Betul personally owned 70,000 slaves between them.
</li><li> Suffragists in multiple countries tend to get this treatment.
<ul><li> On hearing the word "Suffragette", people generally think of women advocating the extension of the franchise to their gender. However, this is the result of the term being conflated with the broader idea of suffrage activism, whose practitioners were called "suffragists". In reality, the term was used by contemporaries to describe UK militants such as the Women's Social and Political Union. Many of their activities were property damage, up to the point of domestic terrorism. Arson and bombings were not off the table. Furthermore, the amount of positive impact they had is subject to debate among historians. While it's generally agreed that their early activities had a dramatic mobilizing impact on the suffrage movement, there is a school of thought that argues the suffragettes did more harm than good overall when it came to their cause.
</li><li> One aspect of the British (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">Imperial</a>) Suffragists (not just suffragettes) that's frequently overlooked was their involvement in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_feather">White Feather Campaign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, where they shamed men (many of whom <a class="urllink" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/millions-working-class-men-got-vote-100-years-ago/">could not vote<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) into joining the British Army by presenting them with a white feather if they weren't in uniform. This has, however, gotten a good deal more attention in recent years.
</li><li> As for women's rights across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePond">The Pond</a>, it is common to gloss over the virulent racism of the American Suffragists. Not only did they use white supremacist rhetoric and stoke fears of "mongrel overrun" to sell the idea of women's franchise, but some also attempted to block the passage of the 15th Amendment because they were galled that freed slaves would get the right to vote before (white) women.

In reality, Elizabeth <em>willingly</em> left the court to escape from its intrigues (and the discussions over her dowry) and took up chastity/poverty vows under the watchful eye of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a> of a counselor, Konrad von Marburg. The supposed "expulsion" was reported by one of Elizabeth's servants during her process of canonization.
</li><li> On a similar note, it was once thought that Pharaoh Thutmose III was deprived of his throne by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">stepmother and aunt</a> Hatshepsut, who claimed the throne of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> as one of its few female pharaohs (and has been subjected to more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> due to this theory). As it turns out, he was actually Hatshepsut's coregent, and had a lot of power in regards to the country's military.
</li><li> Although Nelson Mandela <em>has</em> achieved much through peaceful negotiations and protest, many works tend to ignore or downplay his time as a part of the leadership of the uMkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the African National Congress. This wing of the ANC was involved in numerous high-profile bombings and acts of terrorism, including torture and execution, which Mandela himself acknowledged as violations of human rights. Since the apartheid-regime genuinely reduced many black African's living conditions to sub-human standard there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">a lot of varied mileage on how much these acts can be judged from a modern persective</a>, but even so you are much more likely to see Mandela be associated with his peaceful protests, his presidency, or his martyrdom as a 28-year prisoner than, say, the uMkhonto we Sizwe's bombing of Church Street or the "Landmine Campaign" which killed 23-25 civillians over the course of two years before the ANC retracted this strategy. It helps that all these acts are associated with the ANC as a whole rather than Mandela as a person.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> is considered by the British to be one of their most popular and inspiring Prime Ministers. During the London Blitz, he gave speeches that would inspire the British to fight on against the Nazis and vowed to never surrender to Hitler even if it meant sacrificing the British Empire. However, many overlook that while they never stooped to the genocidal fanaticism of the Nazis, Churchill's views on race and imperialism were not that spotless either. He held white supremacist views (including a belief in the concept of an Aryan master race) and was rather callous towards British colonial subjects (at one point he even said he would be fine with letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> starve to death during his hunger strike, and perhaps most infamously advocated the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">tear gas against peaceful pro-independence protesters in the Middle East</a>). Even Britain's allied European and Commonwealth nations hold negative opinions of Churchill as he was championed the failed Gallipoli invasion of World War I and ordered the intentional sinking of the French navy during World War II, though Churchill defended the latter decision as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">a necessity</a> to prevent French warships from falling into the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. He also supported summary execution of Axis leaders, and had to be talked out of this by American and Soviet officials. Given how divisive Churchill was around the world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">his opposite portrayals</a> are quite common as well, especially in the former British colonies like India where he is depicted as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilColonialist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilColonialist">Evil Colonialist</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy">Robert "Bobby" Kennedy</a> is often lionized for supporting the civil rights movement and opposing the Vietnam War as both the attorney general and a senator. However, this idolization glosses over the more dubious decisions he made when he was attorney general in the Kennedy administration. While Bobby was largely supportive of the civil rights movement, he gave the FBI permission to spy on Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders accused of being communist sympathizers. Furthermore, he initially supported an invasion of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, wanting nothing more than to punish Castro and avenge the Bay of Pigs fiasco even though it probably would've escalated the situation into a nuclear war. In fairness, he did come around to his brother John's more diplomatic approach and helped de-escalate the conflict by secretly negotiating with the USSR.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> is a weird case of this, in that most media and treatments featuring him tend to play up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">belief in nonviolent resistance</a> and his policy of working with white people whenever possible while downplaying any beliefs that might make him less appealing to a mainstream audience. For one thing, far from being the moderate he's often depicted as, King was seen as quite radical even within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> (and would probably still be considered such today, at least in some respects), and spoke with disgust on what he called "the white moderate" (though it should be noted that a "white moderate" in the 1960s would probably hold considerably different views than a contemporary "white moderate") who are white people who recognized that change was necessary but thought it should happen more gradually. That being said, certain progressives tend to ignore his advocacy for colorblindness, open disdain for black nationalism, emphasis on personal responsibility, and beliefs that not every problem in the black community could be solved just by getting rid of racism. He was also a socialist (albeit a democratic one), believing that a purely capitalist systems encouraged economic inequality that disproportionately hit black people, and that the only way to guarantee the black population be dug from its rut was being given access to jobs and healthcare. In a more traditional example of this trope, his fairly sexist attitudes, plagiarism, patronizing attitudes towards homosexuality (he thought it was a mental illness that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">cured with prayers</a>), and extramarital affairs will also rarely be discussed. Nor did he come up with the idea of African-Americans using nonviolent resistance to gain civil rights; he adopted the idea from <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin">Bayard Rustin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who advised him during the Montgomery Bus Boycott. A common gripe among historians of the man is that the famous "I have a dream" speech has overshadowed many of his other aspects.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s almost certainly time this. The messy nature of Indian independence and it's pretty filled status afterwards has resulted in glossing over his more unsavory aspects. The man himself seems to have held some pretty racist views such as chiding black people for trying to get independent status like Indians, his misogynist attitudes to the point of beating his wife for not cleaning the latrines despite her ill health and his luddism towards technology which pushed the industrialization of India back decades and dismantled much of the industry needed while simply letting himself benefit from those same things.
</li><li> When discussing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Athenian</a> figure Alcibiades, there's a bit of a tendency in some segments of academia and the public to paint him as a misunderstood hero unfairly persecuted by the establishment and by mob rule. Now, it's certainly true that Alcibiades was a very talented individual who possessed some important virtues (courage, determination, a willingness to deprive himself), and his political enemies certainly capitalized on allegations — with little hard evidence to back them up — that he vandalized <em>hermai</em> in order to sentence him to death <em>in absentia</em>. Now, with all that said, Alcibiades was also notorious for his vices, shifting loyalties and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">long string of betrayals</a>, and he organized a coup against the Athenian democracy that replaced it with an oligarchy known as The Four Hundred. Of course, Alcibiades has always been a polarizing figure, so it's not uncommon for him to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">the opposite treatment</a> as well.

There is a bust of him in Tovarievo and a statue of him in Belgrade, and when the latter was unveiled President Nikolić gave a speech in which he said "Princip was a hero, a symbol of liberation ideas, tyrant-murderer, idea-holder of liberation from slavery, which spanned through Europe". This ignores the fact that the so-called tyrant was actually sympathetic to Serbia, that Princep also murdered Ferdinand's pregnant wife, and that this assassination caused one of the worst wars in history. Outside of Serbia, most remember Gavrilo Princip as a murderer who started the first world war, and in Croatia and Bosnia specifically Princip is seen as a terrorist and a proponent of Greater Serbia.

With that in mind, he could be just as brutal as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler">Vlad the Impaler</a> towards his enemies - he forced any Muslims to convert to Christianity or face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impalement</a> which is very shocking given that Albania today is a Muslim-majority country. Nonetheless, Albanian Muslims had invoked him during their national awakening to break away from the Ottoman Empire and some of their historical leaders such as Zog I and Enver Hohxa (Muslim turned atheist) considered themselves successors to Skanderbeg and frame his resistance against the Ottoman Empire not as a religious struggle, but a purely secular nationalist one such as in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWarriorSkanderbeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWarriorSkanderbeg">The Great Warrior Skanderbeg</a></em> biography where his impaling is omitted.
</li><li> Thomas Sankara, first President of Burkina Faso, has been called "Africa's Che Guevara"... and like Che, he's been whitewashed considerably. He certainly did plenty of good for his country and people: he outlawed female genital mutilation and forced marriages, curbed the abuses of feudal landlords and tribal chieftains, embarked on an ambitious reforestation campaign, and tried to ensure all citizens had their essential needs met, among other beneficient actions. Unfortunately, his regime was marred by violations of human rights, such as arbitrary detention of political opponents and extrajudicial killings. His government also set up special courts to try people for corruption, tax evasion and "counter-revolutionary activity", courts that failed to conform to international standards. Sankara also curtailed freedom of the press, attempted to put all the country's trade unions under the control of the government, and his ideologically-motivated refusal of all foreign aid remains very controversial today.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Streeter">George "Cap" Streeter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> frequently receives this treatment, due to certain legends about him reaching the popular consciousness. The story goes that, after running his steamboat on a sandbar in Lake Michigan during an 1886 storm, he decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">start his own community</a>. He invited building contractors to dump their rubble on the sandbar, and once the sandbar became a landmass, he claimed it made up the "United States District of Lake Michigan", which was not subject to the laws of Illinois, Cook County, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>, since it was outside the borders of all three. He would spend the rest of his life resisting industrialist N. K. Fairbank, who claimed to be the rightful owner of the land, as well as the law, only using violence in self defense and fighting for what he considered to be his property until his death in 1921. This romanticized image of a plucky "little guy" standing up to a fat cat and the long arm of the law is untrue. For starters, there was no storm the night he supposedly crashed his boat; what actually happened was that he sailed his boat to the foot of Superior Street and refused to move it for years. The story about him filling in the shoreline is also untrue; it was actually filled in by the Lincoln Park Board so they could build a road on the infill. The whole story was invented by him as part of an elaborate scheme to steal valuable shoreline property. Streeter had no legal claim to the land and he knew it, so he tried to claim it through fraud and forgery. He made large amounts of money selling lots he did not legally own, even going so far as to collect property taxes on them. Periodically, he would bolster his claims by leading squatters to quickly build settlements, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTheVictimCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTheVictimCard">claiming to be the victim</a> when he and his cronies were evicted. He kept up his criminal activity until he was sent to prison for manslaughter in 1902.
</li><li> Since his violent overthrow and death in a 1973 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup">Military Coup</a>, Chilean president Salvador Allende has frequently been viewed as a martyr for democracy, especially in leftist circles. The reality was not quite so simple. While even Allende's harshest critics will generally admit that he kept the more radical elements of the Chilean left in check, he nevertheless frequently thumbed his nose at the democratic process. During his four-year presidency, he refused to obey and/or enforce over 7,000 Chilean Supreme Court and other legislative rulings. Allende was also quite cozy with multiple authoritarian — or even outright totalitarian — regimes, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro">Fidel Castro</a>'s Cuba. It's also worth noting that multiple prominent opponents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> — such as Eduardo Frei Montalva — had earlier heavily criticized Allende. Some have also claimed that he held racist and anti-Semitic views, though these accusations have come under heavy criticism. While he was nowhere near as brutal as Pinochet, calling him a "martyr for democracy" is something of a whitewash.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> was far from a bad person, but that doesn't mean her frequent heroic depictions are accurate or deserved. The story about her saving John Smith from execution has been cast into serious doubt, and fiction tends to invent even more heroism for her than that.
</li><li> 18th Century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighwayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighwayman">highwayman</a> Dick Turpin has widely been romanticized as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">dashing outlaw</a>, sometimes even getting portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">Robin Hood-like</a> figure. The real Turpin was little more than a thug and a murderer. Unlike some other real-life outlaws and robbers who got this treatment, he was recognized as a brutal criminal while he was alive, and only got people upgrading him after his death. Some works — such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HarkAVagrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HarkAVagrant">Hark! A Vagrant</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HorribleHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HorribleHistories">Horrible Histories</a></em> — have lampooned his reputation by pointing out how heavily he's been romanticized and giving a more historically accurate portrayal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> often gets this treatment — especially in Western circles — for his opposition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>, his military genius, and his brilliance at journalism. He became the poster boy for the anti-Stalinist left because he condemned Stalin's atrocities and totalitarianism. Even many non-socialists, then and now, see him as representative of the "democratic" and "nonviolent" form of communism. However, in reality, he had an authoritarian streak and was a firm believer in using violence and terror to utterly destroy any opposition to communism. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Russian Civil War</a>, his actions were pretty appalling even by the standards of the notoriously brutal conflict, and he ruthlessly put down any uprisings against the Bolshevik government. One of his most infamous actions in this vein was his brutal crushing of the Kronstadt rebellion, which Emma Goldman castigated him for. Trotsky also agreed with Stalin much more than a lot of people realize, opposing his purges not for moral reasons but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">they were directed against fellow Bolsheviks</a>. When he did disagree with Stalin, he often wasn't much better: for example, he advocated for world revolution and criticized Stalin for <em>not</em> trying to spread communism elsewhere. He also wasn't as competent a politician as he's frequently remembered, since he made a lot of foolish mistakes and tended to make enemies easily. Even his opposition to Stalin wasn't quite how many have portrayed it: he thought Stalin was a boring, crude, dull bureaucrat and political nonentity who served as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">front-man</a> to an oligarchy of much more capable "Bolshevik Rightists", and didn't realize how badly he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">underestimated him</a> until close to the end of his life. Of course, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">how divisive Trotsky can be</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">the opposite treatment</a> is also fairly common.
</li><li> Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is recognized as the father of modern Turkey, and revered in his home country and respected abroad. To be sure, there are plenty of reasons to respect him and his legacy: he preserved Turkish independence and unity, made the Turkish Republic a successful modern nation-state, dramatically increased the literacy of the Turkish population, and granted equal rights to Turkish women. However, his efforts to ensure that the Turkish people were prosperous were accompanied by discrimination against non-Turks, such as banning them from getting jobs in the government. This discrimination included attempts to forcibly Turkify them; many ethnic Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Arabs, Bulgarians, Persians and Assyrians (among others) were even forced to adopt Turkish-language surnames. Even discounting this discrimination, his rule was often of an authoritarian character: for example, his attempts to Westernize the Turks included prohibiting the wearing of headgear deemed too "Islamic" such as turbans and fezes.
</li><li> Edward Smith, captain of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a></em>, is generally depicted as a kind and gentle grandfatherly figure who gets more or less bullied by somebody else (usually J. Bruce Ismay) into disregarding ice warnings and sailing at near full speed into an ice field. In reality, Smith disregarded the ice warnings and kept the ship's speed up of his own volition. Smith also wasn't the meek complacent man he is often portrayed as, but a rather imposing, self-confident man with old-fashioned views on ship navigation. Another thing about Smith that is often overlooked in fiction is his trouble operating large ships; he had several <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Olympic#Hawke_collision">unfortunate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://titanic.fandom.com/wiki/Near-collision_in_Southampton">incidents<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that foreshadowed the <em>Titanic</em> disaster.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesII">Charles II</a> of England tends to be remembered as a fun-loving, sophisticated king who brought back the good things in life after the Puritan excesses of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s regime (known as "The Protectorate") and the bloody civil war. Others praise him for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a> who genuinely cared about his wife and mistresses and would take "no" for an answer. But he was also a diehard absolutist, could be amazingly unprincipled and was willing to forsake freedom of religion even more than Cromwell did (as per his agreement with the Scots in the later civil wars). When he actually got into power, he was at times somewhat inept in actual government, and brought England to the nadir of its strength in two disastrous wars against the Dutch Republic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">a nation that had sheltered him in exile</a>.
</li><li> The Puritans themselves are seen as this and taught this way in American schools, which tell that they were fleeing persecution in England and came to America for religious liberty. The exact <em>circumstances</em> of why they were forced to leave, including their rebellion in the English Civil War, the beheading of the old king, and Oliver Cromwell's rule over a Republican England, all of which the Puritans were held responsible for after Charles II's return and the Glorious Revolution, often goes unmentioned. In addition, the Puritans came to the US to establish religious liberty for themselves only, not anyone else. They were notoriously intolerant of other religious views, and the states of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut were founded by religious dissenters driven out of mainstream Puritan Massachusetts communities.
</li><li> Jomo Kenyatta, famous activist for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kenya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kenya">Kenya</a>'s independence and the country's first head of government, is widely considered the father of his country and the frequent recipient of praise. This is deserved to some extent: under Kenyatta's leadership, Kenya saw a number of improvements. He dismantled the colonial-era system of racial segregation peacefully and with minimal disruption, greatly improved the country's education and healthcare systems, and brought about a Kenyan economic boom. That being said, however, he wasn't exactly an ideal leader. He favored his own people — the Kikuyu — over Kenya's other ethnic groups, allowing them to hold most of the country's important government and administrative positions despite making up less than 20% of the population <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1088x4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1088x4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1088x4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though that's not to imply this was a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_minority">dominant minority<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> scenario, since the Kikuyu were and remain Kenya's largest ethnic group</span>. Corruption flourished under his administration, and he took advantage of his presidential position to enrich his family and friends. Kenyatta's leadership also had a strong authoritarian streak, and he openly desired that Kenya be a one-party state. While far from the worst of sub-Saharan Africa's post-colonial leaders, Kenyatta was considerably more flawed than his idealized image suggests.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero">Cicero</a> was traditionally remembered fondly by history, and to some extent, he's still quite popular. Even today, there are quite a few people who hold him up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer">Crusading Lawyer</a>, and a defender of democratic institutions. The truth is, of course, much more complicated than this idealistic view of him. While Cicero's legal career was certainly impressive (he only lost one case, and that was due to blatant juror intimidation), it wasn't particularly ethical or professional, as demonstrated by the many times he won through abuse of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic">Courtroom Antic</a>. As a senator, he was a political chameleon who quickly became known for switching sides whenever it suited his interests to do so. Despite being a <em>novus homo</em> who rose from the lower orders, he was also a proud Optimate who was against measures intended to extend rights to the poor; he was a firm supporter and defender of the aristocratic <em>status quo</em>. Cicero also wasn't as big a supporter of the rule of law as he's often made out to be nowadays, as shown by his response to the Catiline conspiracy. To make a long story short, he had a number of Roman citizens executed without trial in a blatant case of summary justice because of a plot that later turned out to have been more minor and narrow than it may have initially seemed.

Some have characterized them as people fighting against oppressive institutions using stealth and cunning. Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">ninjas</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin">The Hashshashin</a> later on, they've spent a long time being romanticized and glorified. However, this characterization tends to ignore the fact that they weren't exactly popular among other Jews of the era, and that they killed many Jews who didn't agree with them.
</li><li> Henry VII, the first King of the Tudor dynasty is the biggest beneficiary of this in relation to the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> for the king he usurped, Richard III. Henry is portrayed by Shakespeare as a devout and holy liberator from a foul tyrant and ending the Wars of the Roses. Ignoring just how much Richard III's evil is exaggerated, Henry VII is hardly a saint. Some revisionists firstly point out that contrary to reputation, Henry exacerbated and extended the Wars of the Roses by invading England and his usurpation led to more unrest as Yorkist heirs and pretenders would war with Henry VII. Also, Henry imprisoned the innocent Edward of Warwick as a child which possibly drove Edward insane before Henry VII framed him as a traitor and executed him. As a King he was mediocre, paranoid and arguably extorted his lords and people. Though he also was in a loving marriage and was wholly devoted to his wife and never re-married after she died.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SirFrancisDrake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SirFrancisDrake">Sir Francis Drake</a>, being considered one of England's great national heroes, is a frequent recipient of this treatment. His achievements were certainly impressive, and he really was a brave and intelligent man. But many of his qualities and deeds were at least morally questionable. For starters, like all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Privateer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Privateer">privateers</a>, Drake was technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">pirate</a>, except he had a piece of paper from his government authorizing him to commit piracy. Many of the things he did in service of the crown would probably get him classified as a terrorist or war criminal today. His raids on Spanish port cities resulted in the indiscriminate killing of soldiers and civilians alike. One of the "outside-the-box" tactics he used to defeat the Spanish Armada was to employ fireships, weapons considered <em>very</em> dirty at the time, with a similar stigma to that which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">chemical weapons</a> and land mines carry today. Also, his first command was a slave ship. Not even a "legitimate" slave ship either, but an illegal venture of his cousin's, which captured free Africans and sold them on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket">Black Market</a> in an attempt to bypass the legal channels over which Spain held a monopoly.
</li><li> American baseball player <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShoelessJoeJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShoelessJoeJackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson</a> has seen a concerted effort over the last several decades to recast him as either a misunderstood, tortured soul or an illiterate, naive fellow who is unjustly maligned (even considered innocent) with regard to the 1919 Black Sox scandal, in which the heavily favored Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. This has been perpetrated in part via media portrayal in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMenOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMenOut">Eight Men Out</a></em> as well as the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams">Field of Dreams</a></em> and the book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShoelessJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShoelessJoe">Shoeless Joe</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WPKinsella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WPKinsella">W.P. Kinsella</a>, and picked up by several less-than-unbiased individuals. This whitewashing ignores several facts, which get conveniently ignored. First, Jackson admitted via grand jury testimony (dated September 29, 1920) under oath that he accepted money to throw the Series, something court transcripts delineate plainly; he also changed his story regarding level of involvement with some frequency. Some observers point to Jackson's glowingly good stats in that World Series as proof that he wasn't actually participating in throwing games — but this ignores that he only played well in games that were "on the level" (contrary to popular belief, not every game in the 1919 Series was fixed) or in fixed games after a loss was effectively assured. Inning-by-inning analysis of thrown games and perusal of "clean" games shows this clearly. <a class="urllink" href="https://sabr.org/journal/article/an-ever-changing-story-exposition-and-analysis-of-shoeless-joe-jacksons-public-statements-on-the-black-sox-scandal/">See this link for details<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The Confederate States of America, either as a whole or specific figures, have gotten this treatment so much that a term has been created: The "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy">Lost Cause of the South<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Important figures are held in high regard as patriots who fought to defend their home from "Northern Aggression" and to protect their state's rights. They're also sometimes depicted as hating slavery (especially in more recent decades). Many of its military figures have been characterized as great generals defeated by savage northern armies<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11po4o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11po4o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11po4o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While Confederate generals did win individual battles, the North's technological, numerical and industrial superiority, and strategies to force the Confederacy's surrender ultimately proved more successful</span>. Scholars scoff at the whole idea, rightfully pointing out that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">historical revisionism</a> meant to downplay the fact that the southern states seceded specifically to keep their slaves. Lost Causers try to downplay that, of course. Recently, a backlash against this thinking, sparked by the reaction to the Charleston church massacre perpetuated by white supremacist Dylann Roof, has finally allowed the real history to be told. However, the damage has been done, as the Lost Cause belief was, in essence, the bedrock of Jim Crow laws in the south.
<ul><li> Robert E. Lee is often cited as an example of this. One writer ironically observed that the man who had come closer than any other in destroying the United States became an American hero, though arguably his status was bestowed more by his early surrender and reconciliation efforts than his service to the South. Since the 1980s, historians have increasingly criticized the romanticized view of Lee and emphasized his flaws and less than noble decisions. Their skepticism is well-founded: far from being a strong opponent of slavery, Lee allowed his soldiers to capture free blacks in Union territory and sell them into slavery. He also personally owned slaves for a few years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">freeing them</a>, having inherited them from his deceased father-in-law, and punished them severely, including sewing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">their wounds with brine</a> by some accounts. Some historians also note that for all of Lee's battle prowess, his tactics resulted in massive loss of manpower. Of all Civil War army commanders, Lee's troops suffered the highest percentage of combat casualties. His legacy after the war is mixed as well. While he urged reconciliation between the sides, actively recruited Northerners to Washington College after he became its president, and advocated for a free public school system for blacks in the South, he also adamantly opposed giving blacks the right to vote, believing they were not yet educated enough to be able to handle this right (he did not say he felt this way about uneducated whites).
</li><li> Stonewall Jackson also tends to get portrayed as a heroic figure, and more often than not as someone who disliked slavery and hoped for its end. While he wasn't exactly an ardent defender of the "peculiar institution", that's not to imply he was outright against it either. He was, if anything, ambivalent about the matter; he figured that if God wanted it to end then it would end in God's time, and if God didn't want it to end then it wouldn't. He did get in trouble for teaching slaves how to read and write in defiance of laws against it, famously defending his decision to do so by declaring that "The Lord intended all His children to be able to read His word", but he nevertheless believed that black people could be literate and still remain in slavery.
</li><li> Works that give the Confederacy a Hero Upgrade tend to give it a Competence Upgrade as well, essentially stating that it only lost the war <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a> (what the "nail" actually <em>is</em> varies from work to work). Credible historians regard this line of thinking as almost nonsensical and the South's defeat as assured from the beginning of the war, thanks to, among many other things, a <em>massive</em> resource disparity between it and the North, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">over-dependence on the cotton industry for commerce</a>, foreign countries refusing to aid it due to seeing the country as a backward joke, and a nigh-comically-long list of ways its abuses of its black citizens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">came back to bite it in the ass</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune">Date Masamune</a> is played like this in many works. In real life, he may as well be categorized with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>; he killed his brother to rise to power (his nagging mother constantly opposed him and promoted his brother for clan leader) and betrayed the alliance with the other clans without much discussion (and conquering them). He also showed little respect to Hideyoshi when he was called to join the attack on Odawara (and late to come to boot!). But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo">Samurai Deeper Kyo</a>,</em> he ends up becoming Kyo's ally, though he may be rude and brash (aka Bontenmaru). And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em>, he becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> hero with a somewhat charming personality and several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments (seen with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Kojuurou</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Itsuki</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the Drama CD</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Oichi</a>) And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna">The Ambition of Oda Nobuna</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">she</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">Cute Bruiser</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> who's an ally of the heroes. This one is averted in Koei's Warriors series. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em>, he comes off as a jerk, but hides a lot of ambitions that are beneficial for Japan. But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a></em>, he becomes Orochi's henchman and is pretty much loyal to him and has no qualms on bringing chaos into the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang">Fritz Lang</a> becomes one of Ed's allies in Weimar Berlin, and is depicted as an anti-fascist badass who opposes Nazism as early as 1923. His real-life political leanings are less well known and Lang actively obscured them with his creative retellings of his life in Germany. However, he was thrown out of at least a couple German exile parties in Hollywood for making anti-Semitic comments, and was known to be abusive to his cast and crew on set. (Granted, it's hard to expect historical accuracy from a film that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> depicts the Beer Hall Putsch as part of a coordinated effort to take over Germany with the help of a group attempting to open a portal into Ed's alchemical universe.</span>) Lang putting an entire film crew into mortal danger just to get a shot of a dragon for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieNibelungen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieNibelungen">Die Nibelungen</a></em> seems fairly like him, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> turns Saitou Hajime into a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. In actual history, he did manage to survive the mess that was the Meiji revolution and became a member of Japan's secret police (pretty much their equivalent of the FBI), but Watsuki freely admits that he pretty much made up all of the other details about Saitou's personality (as a minor note, RuroKen Saitou claims to have given up drinking, while in real life he died of a stomach ulcer as a result of it).
<ul><li> Saito is sort of an odd example as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">he's initially</a> introduced as a vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> and Watsuki comments on getting angry letters for giving him a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a></em>, which might explain why soon after his introduction, Kenshin describes him as a morally pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, and he becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> from that point onward.
</li><li> The manga's treatment of Okubo is closer to this trope. He's historically seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Sleazy Politician</a>, and that aspect is certainly part of his character, although he's presented as working for the best for his country and deserving of the respect he gets from Kenshin and Saito. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> comments on wanting to rehabilitate his image, noting that in terms of corruption, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">wasn't much different than Japan's current politicians</a>.
</li><li> Then, there's also the fact of how Watsuki portrayed the infamous Hitokiri Kenshin Himura. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, Kenshin is actually based on a real life assassin, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawakami_Gensai">Kawakami Gensai<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Like Kenshin, Gensai was also noted for his slim and feminine built, ties with the Ishin Shishi, and ruthless pursuit of moral agendas. Unlike the red head however, Gensai did not say "oro" as a mannerism, he did not like Western "barbarians" entering his homeland, and he killed scholars who studied Western ideologies. He was also far from the pacifist that Kenshin was after the war; instead, he continued the fight for his rights as a samurai and was executed by the same government he dedicated his life to create and defend.
</li></ul></li><li> While this trope applies primarily to human beings and not machines, the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> counts. The real life warship may have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat">Cool Boat</a>, but battleships were being eclipsed by aircraft carriers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and the <em>Yamato</em> was no exception, with no kills during the war except possibly one small escort carrier, and being ignominiously sunk by aircraft while on a one-way suicide mission. Not the most appropriate ship to undertake a voyage to save the earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>
<ul><li> Takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>, certainly an inspiring figure in his own right, but hardly a morally superior one, and turns him into what may be one of the most inspiring characters in anime and manga history by giving him a complex philosophy that guides him while staying relatively true to the original Alexander's historical actions and fiery, straightforward personality, occasionally even calling him out on some of the less heroic actions of his historical counterpart. His Noble Phantasm is the result of the loyalty and inspiration he evoked in his followers, ignoring that the real Alexander's erratic actions won him plenty of criticism, resulted in his killing at least a few of his followers/friends and ended his expansions when low morale resulted in his army rebelling against him and insisting that they return home.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateStrangeFake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateStrangeFake">Fate/strange fake</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart">Richard the Lionheart</a> at first appears to be a noble and chivalrous (if eccentric) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>, so much so that his Master, Ayaka, starts feeling guilty that he even bothers with her. However, it eventually becomes clear that Richard had a fairly disastrous, blood-soaked reign and isn't exactly proud of his actions in life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra">Fate/EXTRA</a></em> does this with its version of Saber, who turns out to be the Roman emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero">Nero</a>. Here, she wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a> as the real Nero is known as, but rather a very kindhearted individual who loved everyone under her rule, but demanded they loved her in kind, thus causing her to commit suicide out of despair when the coup in 68 AD began and no one rose to defend her. Amusingly, in-universe she's a victim of the opposite trope, as she <em>still</em> has the same reputation the real Nero does, and in fact it seems to be even worse, as the appellation "the Whore of Babylon" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">the Book of Revelation</a> is applied to her specifically, rather than to the Roman Empire in general under Nero's rule as many real-world scholars argue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Fate/Apocrypha</a></em> shows that this sort of thing is an inherent part of the form a Servant is summoned in, depending in part how well-known they are and what kind of reputation they had in the place they're summoned. For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladTheImpaler">Vlad the Impaler</a> is summoned as a Lancer-class Servant there for the second time, after his appearance in <em>Fate/Extra</em>. In <em>Extra</em>, set on the moon, he's a deranged killer highly reminiscent of a vampire (despite not really being one, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">taking offense</a> at such a suggestion), and any of the three playable Servants can defeat him in battle. In <em>Apocrypha</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeFieldAdvantage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeFieldAdvantage">since he was summoned in his native Romania</a> (and pretty close to his actual home town at that), he's a more well-adjusted, charismatic, and <em>extremely</em> powerful being that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to the producers</a>, would be able to defeat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>'s Berserk and Saber (respectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Hercules</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>, who are well-known around the world and have more agreeable reputations, but were summoned in Japan).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kingdom">Kingdom</a></em> paints the young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a> in a far more positive light than his reputation within contemporary Chinese sources and history.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em> takes the usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpGrade">villain-upgraded</a> characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em> and give them their original <em>proper</em> roles (Ja'far, to name one).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> conveniently leaves out any mention of Spartan pederasty and slaveholding (of fellow Hellenes no less), which were major parts of their culture at the time, to keep them sympathetic to modern audiences. The film also leaves out their extreme devotion to religion in an attempt to appeal to gung-ho masculine audiences, going as far as having the hero criticize the Athenians as "boy lovers" and call out their own clergy as "corrupt." However, this is justified as the comic is narrated by the Greek soldier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Dilios</a>, hence the lionization of the Spartans.

The story begins with the Spartiates hunting down slaves who had proven a little too successful at war.

<ul><li> The imperial Romanov family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Anastasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Anastasia">Anastasia</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> really just grabbed the opportunity to portray another idyllic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Disney-like</a> princess, while neglecting to mention all the reasons the revolutionists thought themselves justified in their actions. On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Grigori Rasputin</a> gets quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a>, and indeed it's implied that the only reason the Revolution happened at all is that Rasputin had cursed the family.
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> movie, has some examples of this.
<ul><li> John Smith is given this treatment to the point where critics agree this is the version of John Smith the actual Smith would have wanted history to see him as. The real Smith wrote boastful accounts of his adventures, in which he spun fact into legend and portrayed himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>-like figure. One of the reasons historians doubt the story about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> saving his life is that that's one of <em>three</em> times he claimed to have been rescued by a native woman. Either native women really had a thing for him or he was a rather uncreative writer. Also, John Smith was much more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, with one of his well-documented actions being taking a Native leader captive so that the leader's tribe would provide him with plentiful resources.
</li><li> While the Powhatan are portrayed as flawed but fundamentally decent people rather than incorruptible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">noble savages</a> — probably at least partly for the benefit of the movie's themes — the film glosses over some of their more questionable actions (such as inviting starving colonists to a banquet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty">only to murder them</a>). Chief Powhatan in particular gets this, becoming a wise and noble (if imperfect) leader. The real Chief Powhatan, on the other hand, often behaved like a massive douche - one of the most notable examples is him not lifting a finger to save Pocahontas when she got kidnapped by some Englishmen (in fact, Pocahontas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">rebuked her father</a> for this the last time she saw him).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PocahontasIIJourneyToANewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PocahontasIIJourneyToANewWorld">the sequel</a>, John Rolfe is portrayed as a generally positive character who hesitates to get involved with Pocahontas due to thinking she was still in love with John Smith. In reality he married her at least in part for political reasons shortly after her aforementioned kidnapping, and agonized over the repercussions of marrying a "heathen" (even though by this point Pocahontas converted to Anglicanism). He's also thought by some historians to have been involved in introducing slavery to England's New World colonies.
</li></ul></li><li> Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElCid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElCid">El Cid</a> is portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">a young brave, romantic knight</a> who rallies both Muslims and Christians to fight against a tyrant who seeks to crush both and is ultimately loyal to the king who exiled him. The real Rodrigo was largely self-serving and fought for both sides and against each other, which included sacking Christian cities for Muslims and vice-versa. He also famously murdered his wife's father for insulting and slapping Rodrigo's own father, while in the movie, Rodrigo accidentally kills Jimena's father in self-defense after he attempted to kill Rodrigo so he wouldn't interfere in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with someone else.

<h3>Common cases</h3>
<ul><li> Earlier in the USA's history, General Custer was often depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>, a brave hero who fought against the Indians and died alongside his men. This myth extended to both literature and eventually, film. This is most notable in 1941's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyDiedWithTheirBootsOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyDiedWithTheirBootsOn">They Died with Their Boots On</a></em>. More modern sympathies with the Indians have caused him to no longer be portrayed this way, however, often to the point of overcorrection (though eventually this second view would soften, so that Custer now comes off as more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> than an Indian-hating sadist). Custer's heroic myths are due to his wife, who outlived him (she died in 1933, a little under 60 years after him). She wrote <em>three</em> books depicting her late husband as a folk hero. She was afraid he would be blamed for the humiliating defeat and slaughter his troop suffered, and thus spent the rest of her life lobbying extensively to make her husband look a hero.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Specific movies</h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus">Christopher Columbus</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourteenNinetyTwoConquestOfParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourteenNinetyTwoConquestOfParadise">1492: Conquest of Paradise</a></em> is depicted as a calm, kindly explorer who is fascinated by the Native peoples he encounters when he reaches San Salvador. In reality, as deduced from Columbus' own writings, the man was aggressively religious (which is never shown in the film) and considered the Native people he met to be an "intrusion of nature" - he had absolutely no respect for them, and as a governor of San Salvador would commit various atrocities against these people later, including massacring and enslaving them.
</li><li> The Spartans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>. In the movie, Sparta is portrayed as a secular utopia of egalitarianism and freedom. In reality:
<ul><li> Sparta was almost entirely supported by their slave helots, which allowed Spartan men to spend all their time fighting. On the other hand, Spartan women <em>were</em> given more rights than other Greek women.
</li><li> The state was the ultimate owner of everything, with citizens being granted assets as deemed appropriate.
</li><li> While the film portrays Spartan citizens as secularists who are disgusted by their corrupt clergy, real Spartans were even more devout than citizens of other Greek city-states.
</li><li> In real life, the Spartans practiced pederasty, sexual relationships between grown men and teenage boys. In the film, Leonidas chides Athenians as "boy-lovers," implying that Spartans were above such behavior.
</li><li> The portrayal of the 300 Spartans as fighting and holding the Persians alone, with a small amount of help from a few Acadians, who are portrayed as being made up of amateur, poor soldiers. In reality the 300 Spartans formed only part (albeit a crucial part) of a coalition of forces from several Greek cities probably numbering 5,000-7,000, the bulk of whom would have by this point been professional, well-trained soldiers, though perhaps not quite as elite as the Spartans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Agora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Agora">Agora</a></em> depicts Hypatia, an ardent pagan in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, as something of an agnostic or atheist. This was presumably done to underscore the film's (historically inaccurate) faith vs. reason conflict, as well as allow her to use empirical reasoning. In reality, empiricism was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-07-28/#feature">contrary to her school of thought and religion.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> She is also shown making astronomical advances which rely on these methods (despite there being no contemporary evidence tying her to these advances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ali">Ali</a></em> gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> a pretty big upgrade by glossing over or reducing some of his less likable aspects. His extreme views on race and religion are toned down significantly, views which, in real life, caused a great deal of controversy even amongst people who otherwise held him out as a hero. Notably, his denunciations of integrationist policies and the Civil Rights Act are absent, as are the episodes of him preaching of America's imminent destruction (per Nation of Islam theology). The movie also downplays Ali's mean streak when it came to his opponents. In addition to openly taking delight in humiliating opponents he personally disliked (Floyd Patterson and Ernie Terrell being the most infamous examples), his pre-fight insults often degenerated into cheap shots and racial stereotyping (such as calling George Foreman "a white, flag-waving bitch" and Joe Frazier "an ugly, dumb gorilla" and an "Uncle Tom").
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apache">Apache</a></em>, Massai and Al Sieber are portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponents</a> who happen to be fighting on opposites of the conflict. Neither is as purely heroic as the film portrays them. Massai was more outlaw than freedom fighter and, unlike the film version, did not restrict his attacks to the US Army. He robbed, murdered and (according to some accounts) raped civilians. Sieber is known to have perjured himself to ensure Massai recieved a heavier sentence.
</li><li> Taken to ludicrous extremes with <em>The Babe Ruth Story</em>, which depicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth">its subject</a> in such a ridiculously positive light it almost comes off as a parody. In addition to the movie (not unexpectedly) glossing over most of Ruth's vices, it also portrays him as a literal miracle worker, with moments like him <em>curing a paralyzed boy by saying "hi" to him</em>.
</li><li> John Nash and his (first) wife in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em>. In the film, she is still with him in the 1990s when he got his Nobel prize, making it a heterosexual triumph-of-love story. In real life, she divorced him in the 60s when he got caught hanging around in public toilets picking up young men, and he wasn't allowed to accept his Nobel onstage due to being off his meds. He did, however, reconcile with and remarry her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915">The Birth of a Nation (1915)</a></em>: One of the main reasons this movie is so infamous is its glorification of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">First Klan</a>, treating it as a morally justified insurrectionist group.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation2016">The Birth of a Nation (2016)</a></em>: Unlike in this movie, Nat Turner and his followers were known to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">murdered white children</a>, including a baby in its crib. The movie also depicts Nat turning himself in so that a spate of reprisal killings against black people will end; in reality, Nat spent six weeks hiding out in the wilderness before a local farmer discovered him squatting in Native American territory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em> upgraded William Wallace into the architect of Scottish Independence and downgraded Robert Bruce to little more than a background character.
<ul><li> Robert Bruce is one of the great heroes of Scottish history, and his guerrilla campaign against the forces of Kings Edward I and II was much larger, went on for much longer and was far more successful than Wallace's. Plus, it shows Bruce betraying Wallace, when in reality he never once betrayed Wallace - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">everyone</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">else</a></em>, sure, but never Wallace. Wallace also never met Princess Isabella, and certainly wasn't the father of Kind Edward III - for one, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Isabella was only a little girl at the time.
</li><li> Likewise, contrary to the kind of anachronistic Pictish barbarian highlander that Walllace comes across, the real one was a feudal lord. Not a wealthy or prestigious one, but definitely part of that society's elite. He owned serfs, and lorded over peasants, and likewise, when he invaded England pre-emptively, he and his army sacked and burnt villages, attacking English peasants and serfs.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeOfSpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeOfSpies">Bridge of Spies</a></em>, Frederic Pryor, an American student in Berlin who was taken prisoner by the East German authorities because he was in East Berlin on the day the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall">Berlin Wall</a> went up, is depicted as being captured in a heroic attempt to help a non-existent German girlfriend escape to the West. In reality, he was trying to return his library books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cleopatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a></em> does this with both the title character and Mark Antony, with a corresponding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Octavian</a>. Antony is portrayed as a dashing romantic hero and an able leader, and it's fully implied that Rome would've been far better off under him than Octavian, who is depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>. In real life, <em>Antony</em> was the more violent of the two. The historical Cleopatra was well-known for backstabbing and murder-for-hire, as well.
</li><li> Istvan Szabo's <em>Colonel Redl</em> (1985) does this for Alfred Redl, infamous Austrian spymaster-turned-traitor. Most historical accounts claim that Redl betrayed military secrets to Russia after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">blackmailed</a> for homosexuality, though a few accounts suggest he merely did it for the money. By contrast, Szabo's Redl is essentially scapegoated by officials in the Austro-Hungarian government to distract from a coup d'état plotted by Archduke Franz Ferdinand - who conversely gets a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> as a bloodthirsty warmonger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves">Dances with Wolves</a></em> gives this treatment to the Sioux, portraying them as simply defending themselves from the Pawnee. In reality, the Sioux were the aggressors in that conflict. During the late 18th Century, they began pushing the Pawnee and other native peoples out of their ancestral lands, and were still committing atrocities against them decades later.

The film portrays Franco as bravely standing up to the Inquisition (which receives a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a>) at her trial for witchcraft, and portrays Venier as being desperately in love with her, and defending her from the Inquisition, and persuading the rest of the Venetian Senate to do so as well. In reality, Veronica Franco was never in any real danger from the Inquisition. They tried her twice for witchcraft and let her go without punishment after she testified to performing rituals solely as entertainment. In fact, the Inquisition regarded accusations of witchcraft as silly superstition, and acquitted accused witches as a matter of course. The film also, in an earlier scene, depicts Franco as a hero of the Venetian republic for persuading the king of France, by being just that good in bed, to ally with Venice against the Turks. In real life, King Henry III of France did sleep with Franco when he visited Venice to negotiate the alliance, but that had nothing to do with why he allied with Venice.

While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">he kept to himself</a> in a cabin in the wilderness, reportedly he kept messing with the locals' hunting traps. The mounties tried to question him two separate times, bringing a search warrant the second time around, but he ignored them. This eventually resulted in a shoot-out between Johnson and the mounties after they forced his door, wounding several lawmen. The film makes him a lot more sympathetic by turning him into a Great War veteran who is really just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold">kind-hearted hermit</a>, having him nurse a maltreated dog back to health, and only becoming a fugitive after a group of vengeful locals force him into a shoot-out by attacking him.

In contrast to the film, the Partisan leaders held more resources than the rest, and took first pick of the women as sexual partners. Also, there are controversial allegations that they participated in NKVD-ordered atrocities against Poles who resisted giving supplies to the Soviet Partisans.

The fact the movie is closer to actual history regarding Dracula than most (not that this is saying much) also helps this trope. Namely, Vlad <em>doesn't</em> make a habit of impaling his own people, and he's known as the Impaler because of his deeds in the past, not his deeds as ruler.

The real life Lucilla <em>was</em> indeed involved in a plot to assassinate her brother...but according to contemporary historian Herodian it was because of her own jealousy and desire for power (in fact he even blames her attempt to have Commodus killed as what made him so paranoid in the first place).
</li><li> The 1940 German film <em>Das Herz der Königin</em> ("The Heart of the Queen"), viewed by many critics as an anti-British propaganda movie, portrays the troubled Mary, Queen of the Scots (Zarah Leander) as a beautiful saintly martyr whose heart is full of love for her people and who wishes above all to give them freedom and happiness. She spends the majority of the film frolicking around Scottish castles in glamourous anachronistic gowns while singing pretty songs about her tragic life.
</li><li> <em>The Hurricane (1999)</em> depicts Rubin Carter as an unambiguously innocent man who was wrongly convicted largely thanks to a racist cop with a longstanding grudge, and exonerated thanks to the efforts of three Canadian activists and a young African-American who wrote to him in prison. This is not what happened: the real Carter was never exonerated, or even acquitted. In reality, no evidence proving he was innocent was found, just some that had not been presented by the prosecution. He was ordered released or retried — the state of New Jersey appealed this ruling, lost, and chose to not retry him again (he had already been retried before in 1976, with another guilty verdict resulting). The real Carter's guilt or innocence is still debated today. Other elements of Carter's criminal history also get whitewashed by the movie. For example, it depicts him being arrested and sent to a juvenile facility in his youth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense">for defending himself against a pedophile</a>. In reality, Carter was locked up for assaulting and robbing a man, a fact nobody disputes.

The movie presented him as an idealist whose goal was for the good of Rome. He also never wanted to do all the ugly things he did but was forced to because of the actions of his enemies. This was also done to a lesser extent with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> who was presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a>.

He is shown to have opposed every questionable decision made by his incompetent captain, heroically dives down into the flaming, sinking Essex to retrieve navigational equipment (a feat actually committed by the ship's steward in real life) and ultimately has a epiphany wherein he realizes whale hunting is immoral, and decides to give up a career as a whaler to settle down into a family life. The latter detail cannot be further from the truth. In reality, Chase went on to have a long and successful career as a whaling captain, at the expense of his family life suffering: he went through 4 marriages in his lifetime. Chase was said by some who served under him to have carried a personal vendetta against the whale which sunk the Essex, and this may well have driven him insane, for he spent some of his later years in a mental institution. While his heroic command of the open boat is commendable, he also made some questionable decisions before, during and after the sinking that may have put his crew in danger.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justifiedtrope">justified</a>, however, by the fact that much of the movie essentially takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">in the senile Thatcher's mind</a>.
</li><li> Jim Garrison is depicted in Oliver Stone's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK">JFK</a></em> as a fearless crusader for the truth, driven by a deep sense of devotion to the slain president and a desire to bring justice to his assassins. The real life Garrison is considered by just about every objective historian to have been either a completely delusional paranoid or a shallow opportunist. He intimidated witnesses, suborned perjury and based his case against Clay Shaw on homophobia.

<ul><li> Balian in the movie is elevated from a knight who made a courageous, humanitarian decision to negotiate with Saladin into an archetypal heroic Everyman knight embodying the best of the chivalric ethos. Balian wasn't as nice as the film made him out to be. Not only was he raised a noble, not a blacksmith as he is in the film, but he betrayed his oath not to fight Saladin on more than one occasion, sold many of the peasants in the siege into slavery and threatened to massacre his Muslim prisoners if Saladin wouldn't accept a surrender.
</li><li> Saladin gets a bit of a Heroic Upgrade too in the film. He's been receiving Historical Hero Upgrades from both Muslims and Christian Europeans (to whom he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>) for so long that it's probably harder to represent him badly.

The film has him falling in love with Jane (and she with him). In reality they seem to have been willing to tolerate each other, Jane's real problem was with her new father in law. The story goes that Guildford requested a final interview with Jane before their executions which she refused on the grounds it would only upset them both.

Likewise, there's been no mystery about Fawcett's death for experts in South America. A local chieftain admitted to have killed him and his son in the forties, but most people rejected that account because they liked the idea of a mysterious disappearance.

The movie is set in Soviet Ukraine in 1941, a.k.a. the very place that was devastated by the Holodomor less than ten years earlier. Not only is there no mention of this, the film makes Soviet Ukraine look like some kind of perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, creating the false impression that Stalin's collectivization totally worked. At one point, Marina, who would clearly be old enough to remember the Holodomor, mentions that she has never really experienced hunger until now. There is also no mention of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, making it look like the Soviet Union was a neutral bystander before the Nazis attacked.
</li><li> On another note, many Ukrainians sided with the Nazis in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, even helping them to round up Jews for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a>. In the film, there are no Ukrainian collaborators. Of course, you could say the film just happens to be focused on a group of Ukrainians who stayed loyal, but even if all the collaborators are safely off-screen, their existence still undercuts the whole theme of the unbreakable solidarity of the Soviet people.

The Abbé basically ran Charenton like it was his own personal palace, and unlike the film was actually a committed Bonapartist-it was not the government that complained about how he ran the institute, but the French medical establishment, largely because he was grossly unqualified. And the terror baths were his idea, along with a lot of other cruel and outdated techniques. While he did encourage patients to express themselves, he wasn't really much interested in curing them.

The real life Boone, whose actions eventually lead to the team mutinying against him (and who died in 2019), more-or-less took advantage of the movie whitewashing his terrible behavior and mimicked Washington's portrayal of him for his public persona, which he used for "inspirational" speaking engagements that often paid him between 10-15K per visit (including one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> in 2008!).

The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobRoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobRoy">Rob Roy</a></em> turns him into a heroic man of impeccable honor, though strangely it still does make passing mention to cattle-thieving, which was a common practice in those days.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenYearsInTibet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenYearsInTibet">Seven Years in Tibet</a></em> downplays Heinrich Harrer's involvement in the Nazi Party. To be fair, he later described it as a youthful mistake and he never actually fought for the Nazis, having left Europe before the start of the war. Still, the image of him insisting that he's Austrian and only reluctantly taking the Nazi flag is a false one.

<ul><li> In this movie, Michael Kelly is portrayed as a rather soft-spoken, gentle and fatherly individual who sticks up for his reporters, including Stephen Glass. While the "sticks up for his reporters and Glass" part is certainly true to life, as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1998/09/bissinger199809">the article the movie is based on notes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the real Kelly could be a lot more aggressive. It's stated that he responded to at least two individuals who challenged the veracity of articles that Glass wrote with very combative letters full of personal attacks. This may be the result of a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">Never Speak Ill of the Dead</a>, as Kelly was killed in action while reporting on the Iraq War months before the movie was released.
</li><li> To an extent Martin Peretz. In the movie he's a hands on type of boss who can be petty to the staff and has a vicious temper but genuinely wants what's best for the magazine and applauds with everyone over Chuck Lane discovering the truth about Glass. In real life Martin Peretz blamed Lane and Kelley for failing to catch Glass and held both of them responsible. Even worse, Lane was immediately fired after TNR published their apology and Lane actually found out about his being fired by a reporter who was interviewing him in regards to the Glass scandal. Then there's the claim that Glass helped pass off some of his confabulations by <a class="urllink" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120884/new-republics-legacy-race">designing them to appeal to Peretz's bigotry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> The members of NWA are depicted as reconciling with Eazy shortly before his death and planning a reunion of NWA. In real life, this never happened, and DJ Yella was the only member of the group present at E's funeral.
</li><li> The film makes no mention of several high profile cases of Dr. Dre beating women (his beating of Dee Barnes was in the original script, but had to be cut for time).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThirteenDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThirteenDays">Thirteen Days</a></em> was criticized by historians and then still-living members of Kennedy's administration because the movie intensely exaggerates the role that Kenny O'Donnell (the main point of view character played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinCostner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinCostner">Kevin Costner</a>) played in preventing the Cuban Missile Crisis from escalating. The chief agent in the American government who pulled the administration together during the crisis was in fact Ted Sorensen, who's instead relegated to such a minor role that he's barely noticeable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone">Tombstone</a></em> takes several liberties to whitewash the Earp faction, even though the film doesn't take it quite as far as earlier films surrounding the Vendetta Ride.
<ul><li> The Earps are portrayed as heading west to strike it rich, but get drawn into conflict with the Cowboys for largely idealistic reasons. In real life, the Earps came to Tombstone in part to strike it rich, but also to avoid arrest warrants in Colorado, and the conflict was largely motivated by money and politics. The Cowboys were intimately linked with agricultural businesses in the area (mostly ranchers who bought the cattle the Cowboys rustled in Mexico) and were by and large conservative Southern Democrats, while the Earps and their backers were mostly liberal Midwestern Republicans with interests in mining and manufacturing.
</li><li> Wyatt himself started out his career in law enforcement as a pimp, and Mattie was, as far as can be determined, one of his working girls. His return to law enforcement was enthusiastic, rather than reluctant, and purely financially motivated [note] In most of the rural US at this time, sheriffs were charged with collecting taxes, and were entitled to a share. In Tombstone at this time, the sheriff's cut could be 30000 dollars a year, at a time when a laborer was lucky to earn a dollar a day.[/note] The Earps' hostility with Behan began when Behan offered to throw the election for County Sheriff in exchange for a cut of the sheriff's share of taxes raised, and then went back on his word.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnitedPassions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnitedPassions">United Passions</a></em> infamously went full hagiography with FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is portrayed as a valiantly unimpeachable crusader against institutional corruption. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderminedByReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderminedByReality">On the very same week the film was released</a>, Blatter was forced to step down for charges of money-laundering and bribery, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">didn't exactly come out of the blue.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUntouchables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUntouchables">The Untouchables</a></em> portrays Elliot Ness and his Untouchables skillfully battling Al Capone and ultimately bringing him down on tax evasion charges. In reality, while the Untouchables put pressure on Capone's organization, and Ness weeded out the corruption in Chicago's law enforcement, it was an unrelated IRS operation that ultimately brought down Capone. Ness's self-promotion at the time helped popularize the impression that Ness was responsible. The film also portrays Ness as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad">Action Dad</a> who gains resolve when Capone targets his family, but Ness had no children when taking on Capone. His later life was marked with business failures and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">alcoholism</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></em>, the German officer corps is implied to be exclusively against Hitler for moral reasons. The fact that many of them harbored racist, anti-Semitic and classist views is glossed over. Their objections against Hitler ranged from him being far <em>too</em> murderous towards the "gutter races", to empowering the lower and middle classes, to simply losing the war.
</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em> paints Guy Fawkes as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">Doomed Moral Victor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> who died to strike a blow for freedom. It fails to mention that he and the other members of the Gunpowder Plot were essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">Western Terrorists</a> mainly interested in replacing the Protestant monarchy with a Catholic one by murdering the whole government. This is more true in the film than in the original graphic novel, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">the adaptation removes the moral ambiguity</a> of V, the self-styled modern-day Guy Fawkes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion">The Wind and the Lion</a></em> depicts Mulai Ahmed el Raisuli as a virtuous man who fights for the autonomy of his people. Most historical accounts show the real Raisuli as being a rather vicious mixture of feudal bandit and political power player. For instance, Walter Harris recounts that when Raisuli's brother-in-law planned to take a second wife, Raisuli <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingCrashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingCrashers">stormed the wedding party</a> and hacked the bride and her mother to death. Shortly after the film's events, Raisuli became the Governor of Tangier and was soon removed from office by the Sultan due to allegations of corruption and imprisoning and torturing his personal enemies. To top it all off, during the Rif War of the 1920s, the real Raisuli allied with the Spanish and French to fight against Morocco's pro-independence hero, Abd el-Krim. Thus, depicting him as a roguish, romantic hero who just wants his people to have self-determination is a pretty major stretch. However, he <em>was</em> reportedly well-read, religiously devout and very polite to his ransomable captives.

The most memorable event in his real reign was his execution of a powerful aristocratic family, therefore making his empire weaker. Is it ever mentioned in the stories? Sometimes, but they don't go too far in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">the opposite direction</a> to Harun himself. In most stories, he's a lovable eccentric going on fantastic adventures-except in stories featuring Ja'far ("The Three Apples" especially), in which he comes off as a bit unstable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em> has a few, mostly with the Shu Han kingdom portrayed as what would be the best path for China to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">Doomed Moral Victor</a>.
<ul><li> This is especially the case regarding on Liu Bei. True enough, he had noble goals. However, his traits have often been exaggerated to make him seem as if he was an extremely honorable man; never mind that he made lots and lots of mistakes that make him pale in comparison to Cao Cao's war abilities (such as irrationally leading the disastrous attack on Yiling, or slamming his infant son to the ground, effectively dooming his future empire). Yeah, author favoritism is also at fault here. Even his goals were less than noble. While the novel depicts him as a loyal subject of the Han Empire and distant relation to the emperor himself, in reality Liu Bei spent most of his life as a mercenary, betraying many warlords who took him in before he establishing Shu Han. And his descent from the Han Dynasty was so distant that his adopted son, Liu Yong, who he ordered to commit suicide because of the birth of his biological son, was more closely related to the royal family.
</li><li> His blood brothers also are as flawed as he was. For example, Zhang Fei, often depicted as a headstrong warrior, was a ruthless bandit who kidnapped Xiahou Yuan's niece in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. And Guan Yu being betrayed at Fan Castle wasn't because of treachery but due to his arrogance as well as refusing to allow one of his children to marry into the Sun family for political reasons.
</li><li> The author portrays Zhuge Liang as completely godlike in every way, except for the minor detail where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has to succumb to overwork in the end because history said so</span>. In real life his greatest weakness was his cronyism and sweeping Wei Yan aside despite his accomplishments.

In reality he was an insignificant officer in Shu's ranks until Chengdu and only became well known after Zhuge Liang's commendations.
</li><li> Special mention goes to Ma Chao, whose father Ma Teng was a willing Han rebel who <em>even served Dong Zhuo</em>, and what does Ma Chao do? He's abandoned his members of his family all too many times, and tried to always rebel against Cao Cao to no avail before his service in Shu.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShahnameh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShahnameh">The Shahnameh</a></em>: The second third of the book mostly concerns semi historical characters or characters based on historical people performing greatly exaggerated or outright fantastic feats, i.e., a strong and patriotic warrior named Rostam probably did live and rule in Sistan, but he sure as hell never killed a WHALE or beheaded a demon!!!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a>'s historical books often give us alternative perspectives on despised and misunderstood figures. His <em>Burr</em> provides a more complex portrayal of the winner of the Burr-Hamilton duel. His <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Creation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Creation">Creation</a></em> likewise shows the Ancient World from the perspective of the Persian hegemony, an abolitionist, multicultural empire as opposed to the slave-owning back-stabbing Greek city-states.
</li><li> A good deal of children's fiction about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> depicts the Royalists as being noble, flawless heroes and the Roundheads as being sly, unscrupulous villains. Adult fiction, on the other hand, often depicts the Royalists as deceitful, Frenchified, crypto-Catholic cads and the Roundheads as solid, honest, decent, beef-hearted true Englishmen. In reality, of course, both sides had legitimate points and obvious wrongs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyYearsAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyYearsAfter">20 Years After</a></em> stops just short of making Charles I <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMessiah">The Messiah</a> mk.

The real Mary was known as "The Great Prostitute" because of her promiscuity. Her family went so far as to recall her from the French court because her behavior there was scandalizing them. Anne, on the other hand, only ever slept with one guy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">look how she's remembered</a>.
</li><li> In Harry Turtledove's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth">The Guns of the South</a></em>, Nathan Bedford Forrest is portrayed as being fiery, devoted, and honorable, though his racist ideals aren't shied away from. In the first and third Acts, he is shown to be a hero for the South, and he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">Graceful Loser</a> at the end of the Second, ultimately agreeing to serve an abolitionist who beat him in a fair election. The real Nathan Bedford Forrest is perhaps best known for being the first Grand Wizard of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (which notably <em>doesn't even exist</em> in the book's altered timeline, because the CSA wins the war).
</li><li> In <em>The Hooded Riders</em>, author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JTEdson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JTEdson">J.T. Edson</a> portrays the outlaw and gunfighter John Wesley Hardin as a wrongly accused hero, and his killing of a black man is presented as self-defense.

While even heroic medieval warlords behave on occasion like, well, medieval warlords, there is more religious tolerance than is credible and Antonina's loyalty to Belisarius is raised above what some sources would indicate. Although the explanation is used by the book that much of that is malicious court gossip, and that explanation is not totally rejected by real historians.
</li><li> Subverted in the fictional story "Operation Chickenhawk" in Al Franken's <em>Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot</em>, where Newt Gingrich, Dan Quayle, Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm, Clarence Thomas and George Will serve in the Vietnam War (which they all avoided in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>), but prove to be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a> or dead meat.

</li><li> In <em>Ravna Gora</em>, a Serbian series about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> Chetnik movement made by Rado Bajić, Chetnik leader Draa Mihajlović is shown to be rather humble and nice, unlike the true historian picture of him and his movement, which says that they were murderous and chauvinist... The author explained how he wanted to show the truth, but he also made the movie as artistic expression (even if artistic expression and true history don't go together)... This can be explained due to growing Serbian nationalism after the breakup of Yugoslavia. That said, while they weren't saints the Chetniks probably get more sympathy nowadays due to being opposed to the communist Yugoslav Partisans led by Tito, who visited horrible fates on them after taking control of the country.

Clarendon, a prominent Royalist who regarded Cromwell as the most wicked of all men neatly summed up the contradictory nature of Cromwell, noting that 'as he had all the wickedness against which damnation is denounced and for which hell fire is prepared, so he had virtues which have caused men in all ages to be celebrated' even praising his industriousness and wisdom even if they were put to what he saw as evil use.

David Kenyon Webster gets a pretty sympathetic portrayal, largely because author Steven Ambrose thought of him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a>. According to other Easy veterans, Webster was a lazy and ineffective soldier who only ever did the bare minimum, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who thought his Harvard education <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">made him better than everyone else</a> and wasn't shy about it either. He had few, if any, friends. Webster's own war memoir doesn't help his case, as it's mostly filled with his complaints about the army and just about every officer in the company (generally that he's smarter than they are, according to him at least) except Major Dick Winters, who gets only a single brief mention. Bill Guarnere, Babe Heffron, and Don Malarkey, who all wrote their own memoirs, disliked him and felt that the book and miniseries gave him far too much credit.

Many years later he tried to start another rebellion and took Duncan to meet Charlie in Italy. We initially see the meeting from the friend's perspective, showing Charlie in his pop culture persona as charismatic and noble. Then we see the true events from Duncan's viewpoint, showing Charlie as the broken alcoholic he really was at that point in his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors">The Tudors</a></em> is notable and controversial for its sympathetic portrayal of Mary Tudor (yes, the same "Bloody Mary" who burned 280 Protestants at the stake). While the show doesn't shy away from her religious extremism, a greater focus is put on her tragic circumstances... Turns out that having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">megalomaniacal, tyrannical father wasn't all that easy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWhiteQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWhiteQueen">The White Queen</a></em>: This is the most sympathetic live-action portrayal of King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III</a> ever made. Richard was not the <span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> of Shakespeare's play, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, he maneuvered from the start to push Edward IV's sons and the Woodvilles aside in order to grab power for himself, and he <em>probably</em> had the Princes in the Tower murdered. Here, he is sincere about intending to crown Edward V, he had absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with his nephews' disappearance (in fact, he freaks out when he realizes that they're missing), and he makes peace with his sister-in-law Elizabeth Woodville. It's Margaret Beaufort <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> who schemes her way into pitting Richard and Elizabeth against each other, and it's she and her husband Thomas Stanley who basically trick Richard into seizing the throne.

In reality, Abbas wasn't a nice guy and was hated by his colleagues since he mistreated anyone he suspected who wasn't loyal to the new Iranian regime. Furthermore, those officers who dislike him even claim he wasn't even qualified to fly an F-14.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em>, where it states that Richard III's reputation was a result of Henry VIII's changing of history, and that instead of being a wicked king, Richard was a loving uncle to his two nephews, one of whom would eventually become king.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhenTheySeeUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhenTheySeeUs">When They See Us</a></em>: The miniseries largely glosses over the 5's actual crimes against other people in the park, which included assault and robbery. Perhaps ironically, these helped exonerate them in addition to Reyes' confession, since it was shown they had been elsewhere committing them at the time of the rape. Naturally, this alibi wasn't used at trial, since saying "I was assaulting somebody else" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">not really helpful</a>. They were also convicted of these crimes along with the rape, but the film omits this (they got thrown out as well due to their questionable confessions).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarbariansRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarbariansRising">Barbarians Rising</a></em>: This docudrama miniseries has multiple cases of this trope, both on a national and individual level.
<ul><li> The barbarian peoples covered are depicted as freedom fighters against the evil, pro-slavery empire of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>. Of course, the show glosses over the fact that slavery was common virtually everywhere at the time, that all barbarian tribes presented in this show practiced it, and that Roman slavery was arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>. Some of the barbarians are known to have indulged in human sacrifices, ritual mutilations and other horrifying things that Romans were scandalized at.
</li><li> Ancient Carthage gets portrayed as a kind of "good counterpart" to Rome whose victory would have been preferable. In reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Carthage was also an imperialistic, slaveholding power prone to seriously brutal acts</a>, and it was actually a harsher master than Rome to its client states and subject peoples in some ways. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Punic Wars</a> between Rome and Carthage were far more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">grey-shaded</a>, with both sides being pretty questionable by modern standards and neither one holding a decisive moral edge.
</li><li> Hannibal was not a freedom fighter as stated in the show, but just a military man motivated by a family feud against another nation. Strangely, the show itself doesn't shy away from showing that Hannibal's oath against Rome was directly based on revenge, which turns it into a sort of inner contradiction.
</li><li> Ditalcus here receives sympathetic motivation for his treachery that does not appear in any historical chronicle, namely that he blames Viriathus and his rebellion for the suffering of his tribe and the massacre of his friends. It's implied this was the main factor in his betrayal of Viriathus, aside from his lack of trust in the man's campaign from the start. Meanwhile, the historical Ditalcus apparently betrayed Viriathus out of sheer opportunism and greed, and judging by the chroniclers' condemnations of him and his cronies, it is clear he didn't have any other reason that is worthy to know.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlotAgainstAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlotAgainstAmerica">The Plot Against America</a></em>: In real life, newscaster Walter Winchell vociferously opposed Nazism and racism during the 1930 and 1940s. In this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>, he starts an actual political campaign and personally faces down fascist thugs to oppose President Charles Lindbergh's Nazi-friendly policies. This version doesn't live long enough to become a villain in the 1950s, when his full-throated support of McCarthyism put his real-life counterpart very much on the wrong side of history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeAfterTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeAfterTime">Time After Time</a></em>: H. G. Wells in the show is a charming man who wishes to be single after going through a divorce. In real life, H. G. Wells had multiple affairs. He left his first wife to marry his second wife Amy Robbins, who allowed him to continue to see other women. He also had children from two separate affairs. The writers seem to not want to show this historical fact, doubtless thinking a cheating womanizer would be less sympathetic. Wells is also portrayed as enthusiastic at seeing more racial equality in the future, saying he'd predicted it as a part of his posited utopia. In fact, his actual stated views on that (admittedly, years after when Wells is portrayed here) were far less savory-he said people of color would "have to go", i.e. become extinct if they didn't evolve enough. It's true his views were more progressive later, praising African-American endurance despite racism, criticizing xenophobia, all "racial purity" ideas and denouncing racism. However, Wells in 1893 may well have still had less pleasant views. Thus, he might not have adapted so easily to learning that his descendant Vanessa is mixed race.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryV">Henry V</a></em> ignores several inconvenient aspects of the historical king, probably because he was a badass warrior King of England at a time when English nationalism was on the rise after hundreds of years of domination by French overlords. Still, he could easily have been seen as a villain, even by the Elizabethans. He executed captured enemy knights, presided over some horrible bloodbaths, doomed both sides to keep fighting a pointless war, burned "Protestant" heretics<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2c2jd');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2c2jd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2c2jd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">strictly speaking, Lollards, but these were seen as Protestant forerunners by many Elizabethans</span> alive—including Sir John Oldcastle, the original of Shakespeare's Falstaff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a></em> ends with Henry and Anne eagerly expecting his heir, the future Queen Elizabeth—ignoring the fact that the entire point of the exercise had been for Henry to get a <em>male</em> heir, and indeed that Catherine had <em>already</em> borne a female heir (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">who would grow up to be Bloody Mary</a>)...not to mention the infamous mess that would come a few years later, with Catherine dead and Anne convicted of capital crimes, both under very suspicious circumstances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em> with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> for Richard, makes other characters look more heroic. Lord Stanley is portrayed as a loyal and noble vassal, who heroically acts to put Henry VII on the throne. In real life the Stanleys were notoriously treacherous and double-dealing, switching between sides, and at Bosworth Lord Stanley didn't do anything with his troops, it was his brother Sir William Stanley who basically stabbed Richard in the back when he attacked his forces. And William was later executed by Henry for supporting a Pretender. However Lord Stanley's descendants ended up funding Shakespeare's plays, hence his glowing portrayal. Another character who gets an upgrade is George, duke of Clarence, who is portrayed as, at worse, a bit naive and foolish, though his joining the Lancastrians is portrayed it is glossed over. In reality George was a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>, who spent a lot of his time plotting against his brother Edward IV, trying to have him declared illegitimate, joining the Lancastrians so he could gain more influence, and finally getting executed after he bullied a court into executing someone, then left court without permission, which was basically the precursor to rebellion. However he is probably portrayed as more heroic to contrast him with his youngest brother Richard.
</li><li> Thomas More's portrayal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AManForAllSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AManForAllSeasons">A Man for All Seasons</a></em> tends to focus on his bravery in maintaining his principles even when he knew this would result in his gruesome death, presenting him as a champion of the freedom of the individual conscience. Even apart, however, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> that led him (like nearly everyone in his own time) to approve the burning of heretics, More was fully convinced that the state <em>had a perfect right</em> to suppress any <em>open</em> dissent; his entire defense was based upon the plea that he had not made his personal opinions known. He was definitely no advocate of free speech, as the play seems to suggest he was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SirThomasMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SirThomasMore">Sir Thomas More</a></em> is another example of More being portrayed as a more sympathetic person than he really was, making sure to hide away his bad sides and show only the flattering parts.

In fact, Austria became a fascist state in 1934, four years before the Anschluss. Also, most Austrians saw themselves as Germans at the time and welcomed the Anschluss. While the musical does include some Austrian characters who support the Anschluss, it portrays them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Les Collaborateurs</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evita">Evita</a></em>, much like <em>The Sound of Music</em>, implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Argentina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Argentina">Argentina</a> was a democracy before the 1943 military coup that ultimately brought Juan Peron to power two years later. The country had actually been a dictatorship for over a decade, and in fact many Argentines supported the coup.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em> gives out these all around
<ul><li> Hamilton himself:
<ul><li> His anti-slavery stance is greatly increased in order to make him more sympathetic. While the real Hamilton was more antislavery than some people of the time, he did not see slavery as nearly as important an issue as other things were, and tolerated slaveholders among his associates (John Laurens, however, really was that much of an abolitionist). Theres conflicting evidence on if he ever owned slaves but his wifes family definitively did. There is plenty of evidence that he bought and sold them for his various in-laws.
</li><li> His feud with John Adams was incredibly nasty and is only given a song. Adams himself never shows up. While theres blame to be laid at both mens feet, he did everything in his power to actively undermine Adamss negotiations with France for a peace treaty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> and Ron Chernow, the biographer of the book its based on, freely admit that it was toned down to make Hamilton more sympathetic.
</li><li> The play also tones down Hamilton's elitism. Real life Hamilton was accused of being a monarchist due to wanting to re-establish a blue blood elite in the Colonies, and at the Constitutional Convention argued that the President should serve for life, though historians debate if he really believed these things or if the whole thing was an elaborate feint planned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesMadison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesMadison">James Madison</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">make the latter's plan look better by comparison</a>.
</li><li> The show skirts the pretty abhorrent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">Questionable Consent</a> aspects of his affair with Maria Reynolds. Reynolds was a barley literate young mother stuck in an abusive marriage, and given that this takes place in the late 18th century, had no legal recourse or social safety net to fall back on. She went to him for help as an older, more established man who was a cabinet secretary at that point. He also gleefully ruined her life a few years later by publishing the blackmail letters her husband had sent him to get himself out of a tough spot.
</li></ul></li><li> George Washington, as ever, is presented as fairly saintly in the finished play, though this may simply be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">how Hamilton sees him</a>. In earlier drafts, there were hints that him stepping down from the role of President was due to his realization that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCorrupts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCorrupts">Power Corrupts</a>, with King George's theme slipping into his song.
</li><li> Jefferson, while an antagonist in the play's second act, is a lot less cutthroat towards Hamilton than he was in real life.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix">1776</a></em> portrays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams">John Adams</a> as having more modern views of social issues, such as slavery, than the real man possessed. This is not due to any attempt to lionize Adams, but rather because this Adams is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> of John and his more radical cousin Samuel, who really did hold the more progressive positions John espouses in the play.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> is typically portrayed as villainous in most Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalFiction">Historical Fiction</a>, but from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a> 2</em> onwards he gets treated as a pragmatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. Historically, he was much closer to the game's portrayal of Hashiba Hideyoshi as an eccentric yet highly general and administrator. He was not only a ruthless commander, but embraced Western culture and technology before most other Daimyos and implemented several important policies that are still used or directly influence current policy today. Embracing the use of guns (and introducing volley fire using three staggered lines of gunners, so that some gunners would be firing while the others reloaded; this was 20 years before William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg revolutionized European armies by independently developing the same tactic) allowed him to rout his opponents in battle.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>. His character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em> depict him as, while prone to silly antics at times, is an ultimately good guy who wishes for everyone to be happy and inspired loyalty from great warriors like Yukimura Sanada. The game failed to mention his brutal persecution of Christianity, crucifixion of the 26 missionaries sent to Japan, invasion of Korea (and his attempt to do the same to China), lethal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a>, and imposition of rigid social classes that halted the social mobility from which he himself had benefitted. The Korean invasion being omitted may be because KOEI wouldn't dare piss on the Korean due to the bad blood between them and Japanese (which was Hideyoshi's fault, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Capcom</a> makes no mention of that despite giving Hideyoshi a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a>.) Hideyoshi even has some bonds with some Chinese warriors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a></em> (although these Chinese people were in a time before Hideyoshi was born or could even invade.) It also has a very mild take on his notorious sexual rapacity, which saw him go after his vassals' wives and daughters regardless of their age or consent.
</li><li> In the 2nd 3DS game, they introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YagyuJubei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YagyuJubei">Yagyu Munenori</a>, badass swordsman of the Yagyu clan who usually is portrayed as villainous or an utter bastard. In this game, he's said to be possessing none of those overexaggerated bastardizations and is an all around just and honorable swordsman.
</li><li> Nobunaga is also pretty badass in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest">Pokémon Conquest</a> (A Pokemon-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NobunagasAmbition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NobunagasAmbition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> crossover) as in this continuity he not only a Master Pokemon trainer, but is the trainer of a shiny Rayquaza. For those not known in Pokemon lore, Rayquaza is a massive dragon Pokemon, practically a god among Pokemon, and "shiny" is when a Pokemon gets a rare <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14riqg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14riqg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14riqg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> very very very very very very rare </span> alternate colour scheme. The only legit way to get one in the main series games, is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScum">Save Scum</a> about 8000 times.
</li><li> Also, while not that glaring, there's the portrayal of Katou Kiyomasa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em>. In real life, while he's a model general, he's also a <em>brutal</em> pro-Buddhist man, extremely ruthless against Christianity and willingly ordered his men to butcher Christians, cutting the bellies of Christian women then have their infant babies killed. Koei decided to not even touch the Christianity issues for their game, and so Kiyomasa becomes a merely snarky, loyal general to the Toyotomi army with no comments about religion. Funnily enough, in the spin-off <em>Hyakuman-Nin Sengoku Musou</em>, this ends up giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> upgrade to one of Kiyomasa's historical Christian opposition, Konishi Yukinaga, who's instead portrayed as a money-grubbing jerk.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much <em>everyone</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em> series that wasn't instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">made into an outright villain</a> gets some degree or another of this, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> is the biggest — by <em>Sengoku Basara 3</em> he's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>, compassionate and honest, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a> combat style is symbolic of his desire to keep war from ever again severing the Bonds between people, rather than power-hungry and manipulative. Not to mention, he's a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> rather his usual portrayal of being a fat old man.
</li><li> Taking a leaf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> promotes Liu Bei to a man concerned primarily with virtue and honourable behaviour, and one more thing: He's much more of a caring father and is capable of being proud of his son. It helps that the infamous scene where he threw his son to the ground was omitted for the game.
<ul><li> To a lesser degree, his son Liu Shan is also portrayed as, while far from the warrior his father was, a man of virtue. As stated above, it helps that he's not thrown to the ground as a baby...
</li><li> Sima Zhao also gets this, as he was <em>much</em> worse in real life. Zhuge Dan's bio in the game even suggests that Zhao's rule was Tyrannical.
<ul><li> A prime example of this is during Zhuge Dan's rebellion after Dan killed Wen Qin. Zhao states that any soldiers who willing surrenders would be unharmed while Zhong Hui suggests that they should just kill them, when historically it was the other way around.
</li></ul></li><li> Ma Chao is generally portrayed as a man who upholds justice above all else and is loyal to Shu, even in death. While the loyalty part is true...well, let's just say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Wang Yi</a> isn't the only person pissed at him for killing a family. He was rather brutal in real life, and certainly didn't care about whether he was doing the right thing or not.
</li><li> Lu Bu in the games has increasingly been portrayed as being a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a>, going from being obsessed with strength for its own sake in earlier games to wanting strength to protect those he cares for. Historically, Lu Bu allowed his soldiers to pillage, rape and plunder which contributed greatly to his ultimate failure and death.
</li><li> Gan Ning is shown as being a pretty cool dude, and his initial bad blood with Ling Tong eventually gives way to a friendly rivalry. The real Gan Ning was a murderous bastard that most of his fellow generals would've happily killed if not for Sun Quan's protection. He even murdered a young serving boy who'd fled to Lu Meng for protection, despite promising to spare him if Lu returned the boy. Ling Tong hated him till the day he died, and Lu Meng very nearly killed him for the murder of the serving boy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> has this and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">counterpart</a> <strong>as its entire plot</strong>.

<ul><li> For starters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin">The Hashshashin</a> themselves. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHashshashin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHashshashin">real life</a> they were Hassan-I-Sabah's private army not unlike modern terrorists.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart">King Richard I</a> of England, however, got a fairly realistic representation: he went by the title "Lionhearted" even in his own day, and it did not refer to heroism but a love of combat. So, though he's driven to conquer Jerusalem, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">keeps his promise</a> to listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Altaïr</a> finally after he beats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Robert De Sable</a> in single combat, and lets Altair go free afterwards. He's undeniably a jerkass, but he's still portrayed in a relatively positive manner - basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a>.
</li><li> Lorenzo de'Medici is portrayed as being a devout republican and a benevolent ruler. In reality, like all the noble families in the Italian city-states, the Medicis were Machiavellian schemers who committed all sorts of immoral acts to maintain their power. At least it's shown in the <em>Lineage</em> short how Lorenzo brutally tortures an agent of his enemies for information, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Brotherhood</a></em> Lucrezia Borgia claims, probably truthfully that he quashes the families of his rivals utterly, even those who had nothing to do with the plots against him.
</li><li> And who can forget how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> got an upgrade in heroism, despite only being the sort-of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">deuteragonist</a>? Notable changes include that his inventions work, are <em>completely functional</em> and can be used at nearly any time. Plus he's the main character's BFF.
</li><li> According to some fan-theories, the events of the games are filtered through Altair and Ezio's impressions of them. Such as the way beggars in the first game would bother Altair and <em>only</em> Altair.
</li><li> Not to mention that with their advantage in information control, the Templars would obviously try to slander any historical figure who allied themselves with the Assassins.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></em> gives one to Angolan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> Jonas Savimbi. In the game, he's a gregarious and enthusiastic player ally who rides into battle at the head of his army and even pulls off a spectacular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">Gunship Rescue</a> at the end of the mission he's featured in. In real life, while he was known for his charisma and his courage (having a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">leading from the front lines</a> as he does in the game), he was also a war criminal who massacred civilians, funded his army by selling conflict diamonds, accepted military aid from apartheid South Africa, ran the territories he controlled like his own personal kingdom, ordered the torture and execution of his own men if he had even the slightest suspicion of betrayal, and re-started the civil war <em>twice</em> after previously agreeing to ceasefires because he didn't win the post-war elections - it took his death in battle with government troops in February 2002, a full sixteen years after the in-game level he's featured in, to finally bring the war to an end. The characters in the game does comment that Savimbi was insane but don't elaborate over.

<ul><li> Cato the Elder's burning hatred of Carthage, which helps to lay the groundwork for the destruction of Carthage, is portrayed as entirely reasonable and even justified.

In truth, however, Sulla's march on Rome and many of his subsequent actions would play a major role in the erosion of the republic's political norms and the bitter conflict between the <em>optimates</em> and the <em>populares</em>, setting the stage for some very brutal rebellions and civil wars that ultimately resulted in the end of the republic.
</li><li> While the pre-illness months of Caligula's rule were consistent with his portrayals by contemporary historians, the post-illness rule was portrayed as him having an epiphany as being a god. His infamous moment of declaring war on Neptune and collecting seashells as bounty was portrayed as conquering the elements to make crossing the English Channel easier, only stopping short of invading Britain (ergo leaving the task to Claudius) because of other matters to attend to.
</li><li> The Roman administration in Britannia engaged in some extreme abuses, perhaps most infamously having Boudica flogged and her daughters raped. Here, the flogging is omitted and the rape is changed to consensual sex.
</li><li> Hadrian's brutal crushing of the Bar Kokhba revolt is outright glorified. While Simon bar Kokhba and his forces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized">were hardly saints themselves</a>, Hadrian took severe punitive measures against the Jews in general, not just those who took part in the rebellion. Not to mention the fact that the revolt was triggered in part by him reneging on a promise to rebuild the Jewish Temple, instead deciding to build a temple to Jupiter where the Second Temple once stood, then doubling down and building a <em>colonia</em> called Aelia Capitolina over the ruins of Jerusalem.
</li><li> In real life, Caracalla had Geta murdered, but here he's portrayed as loving his brother and treating whatever he perceives as a negative influence, or suggesting he's the one to murder Geta, to a wrathful response. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">That being said</a>, his depiction is otherwise accurate to the violent and wrathful nature of the real Caracalla, albiet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">played for comedy</a>.
</li><li> Elagabalus is depicted as engaging in some ridiculously debauched behavior to bring attention to the Empire's degeneracy problems, and preaching about Sol Invictus to streamline Roman religious practices. In reality, his unrestrained pleasure-seeking was motivated by nothing more than self-indulgent and unethical hedonism, and he simply placed his namesake Syrian sun god above the Roman pantheon.
</li><li> Persecutors of Christians, like Decius and Valerian, have their actions justified as them needing all the help they could get from their pagan gods against internal and external enemies, and needing to punish Rome's Christian population for its obstinance.
</li><li> Diocletian is portrayed as a capable but tragic figure and as such his more questionable actions are subjected to whitewashing. For example, his Edict on Maximum Prices (an attempt to curb inflation that only caused more problems for the Roman economy) is depicted as failing because the world wasn't ready for the full force of his reforming genius.

ERB's Ali also never brings up the fact that Jordan had a white wife, which the real Ali definitely would have done in this context considering he spoke at KKK rallies advocating segregation and gave an interview to <em>Playboy</em> in 1975 where he said that any black man who married a white woman should be lynched (ditto a black woman marrying a white man); the closest the battle gets to addressing the real Ali's racism is him saying Jordan "sold out to crackers".

</li><li> Many of the Saints in the Catholic Church were often unsaintly even after renouncing their formerly wicked ways. To a large degree that is because the colloquial idea of a saint is different from the official idea of a saint; it is after all official doctrine that sinning is part of being human even if you are a saint. Thus they often got upgraded mostly by popular consciousness rather then official tradition.

(Grania "the Pirate Queen" O'Malley, Anne Bonny, and Mary Read especially. But Mistress Ching, curiously, does not get this treatment. ) Granted, life was tough all around and many of these women likely had justifiable reasons for their crimes, but the same can be said for many of their male comrades who aren't given as much slack. And once you read about O'Malley burning a town to the ground or Anne Bonny (maybe) murdering a chambermaid, it's hard to continue seeing them as typical adventure heroines.

He died at 14 (in 1793) in obscure circumstances during a minor skirmish against a group of horse thieves belonging to the other side. Robespierre then used this trivia for propaganda reasons, quoting his fate as a patriotic example, and making up a story about the boy being executing because he cried "Long live the Republic" while his attackers forced him to shout "Long live the King" to save his own life. Bara's remains were supposed to be buried in the Panthéon during the Summer of 1794 (an honor granted to the greatest heroes of the Republic), but the event was eventually cancelled due to Robespierre's downfall. Despite this, Bara's story was still remembered as a patriotic example for more than a century.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Waffen-SS</a> has been known to recieve this treatment in some circles, albiet to a considerably lesser extent than the Wehrmacht mentioned above. Some have depicted it as an apolitical fighting force that was not involved in Nazi war crimes. It has even been idealized as an "Army of Europe", a multinational force where people from all over Europe volunteered for a heroic fight to defend against communist depravity. While it's true that they weren't intimately linked to the Nazi regime's crimes against humanity in the same way as other constituent groups of the <em>Schutzstaffel</em> such as the Allgemeine SS or the SS-Totenkopfverbände, their hands were <em>far</em> from clean. Without getting into too much detail, let's just say there were very good reasons the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organization at the Nuremburg Trials <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15h48p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15h48p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15h48p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though to be fair, said trials also determined that not everybody in the Waffen-SS was a war criminal, and some members are known to have outright resisted Nazi atrocities</span>. Nevertheless, there are some people who continue to depict it as far cleaner than it was in real life, though this seems to be less common in recent years. This has been combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBadassUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBadassUpgrade">Historical Badass Upgrade</a> at times, making them out to be considerably more elite than they actually were.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> is often given this treatment at least in Russian media and propaganda, as well as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChummyCommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChummyCommies">mainstream communist circles</a>. He's shown as a staunch rival of Hitler and one who despised what Nazi Germany did while neglecting the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and that at the start of the war, Soviet Union and Nazi Germany invaded Poland as part of that agreement. He's also given credit for pulling the Soviet Union out of its agrarian economy and into the role of a superpower, but this forced modernization program and incompetence led to a huge famine crisis that led to the deaths of 5 million people. His repressive administration led to mass persecution of political dissidents who were either executed after torture or sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">The Gulag</a>, and it's estimated that more than a million lives were lost as a result of his direct policies with additional deaths caused by the gross incompetence of his administration. Then you get into the fact that Stalin committed acts of ethnic cleansing, deliberately starving millions of Ukrainians and Kazakhs to death (in events respectively known as the Holodomor and the Goloshchyokin genocide), deporting entire ethnic groups to foreign countries (including Germans, Koreans, Greeks and Chinese, among others), forcibly transferring populations within the Soviet Union and its satellite states, and starting up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">his own persecutions of Jews</a> at the time of his death. While Stalin's programs <em>did</em> have a lot to do with the Soviet Union's industrialization and eventual superpowerdom, it came at a huge cost and thanks to the repressive nature of his polices, it left a mess of poor institutions and planning that created additional problems for the Soviet Union, problems that in many cases still plague its successor states.
</li><li> Richard Cornish has gotten this treatment. He was hanged in the then-colony of Virginia in 1625 for the crime of sodomy, and today is a minor gay icon - when the William and Mary Gay and Lesbian Alumni created the Endowment Fund for Gay and Lesbian Resources they named it after him.

When the two of them, Vince and Major Drummond come under fire from Union troops while trying to rescue the wounded Will Monroe, Beauregard runs away as he has seen enough death.

Despite this, he is (justifiably) remembered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">one of the greatest rulers</a> in Cyrodiilic history.
</li><li> Tiber Septim (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">Talos Stormcrown, Hjalti Early-Beard, et al</a>), <em>was</em> the first emperor to unite all of Tamriel and <em>is</em> held up as a paragon of mankind, especially by the Imperials and Nords. Following his death, he <em>did</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">become the god Talos</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">God of War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">Good Governance</a>, and even took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">top spot as the chief deity</a> on the Nordic pantheon. However, elements of his past are almost certainly embellished and/or outright fabricated as part of Imperial propaganda to appeal to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>, whose support he badly needed in order to forge his empire. He may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingslayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingslayer">had a hand in</a> the assassination of King Cuhlecain (who Septim served as General) so that he could usurp the position. Many of his best known exploits can quite possibly be attributed to others (the Underking, Wulfharth Ash-King, Zurin Artus) or, at the very least, his role in them was highly embellished. His legions were brutal in conquering Tamriel, committing many atrocities along the way (such as slaughtering the ruling family of Morrowind down to their young daughter). He almost certainly betrayed and killed one of his closest advisors (Zurin Arctus) in order to power the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Numidium</a> to complete his conquests (and then had his propaganda machine paint <em>Arctus</em> as the villain). Of course, the worship of him isn't entirely unfounded, as there is evidence that he really did ascend to Godhood... and may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">one of the last things</a> holding Mundus together. Additionally, it is speculated that he may have used his divine powers post-apotheosis to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">alter reality</a></em> to <em>make</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">his version of events "true"</a>.

They took credit for all of the positives that came out of the event, as well as many of Nerevar's accomplishments before, while blaming the Dwemer or Dagoth Ur for the negatives, including the death of Nerevar. As such, the Tribunal Temple's <em>official</em> story about what happened there is the most widely accepted version, even though it is clearly the version most full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricalTruth">Metaphorical Truths</a> out of those that comprise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">The Rashomon</a> once you've done a little research.

Despite it being revealed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor">First</a> Dragonborn was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Dragon-Priest</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">Turned Against Their Masters</a> and ruled over Solstheim as a tyrant. However, this is somewhat of an subversion, since the Ancient Nord legends didn't refer to them at all, but actually the <em>Last</em> Dragonborn, prophecied to appear when Alduin returned. This bizarrely makes it a case of <strong>Future</strong> Historical Hero Upgrade.

To Ishgard, the first Azure Dragoon is revered as a hero who slew Nidhogg, took his eyes, and went on to slay many more dragons. To the Dravanians, the first Azure Dragoon is vilified as a monster who... slew Nidhogg, took his eyes, and went on to slay many more dragons. The truth is a bit more complicated, of course: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fight with Nidhogg was in self-defense, after Nidhogg attacked Ishgard when his father, King Thordan I, betrayed the Dravanians by killing Nidhogg's sister Ratatoskr to consume her eyes for more power. He was also horrified by what his father had done, relinquishing his claim to the throne as Thordan's heir in favor of becoming a nameless dragoon who would simply defend Ishgard from further reprisals by the Dravanians, rather than seeking them out to slay them as either side believes. And, as it turns out, he didn't even <em>really</em> kill Nidhogg - he survived long enough to seek out his brother Hraesvelgr, convincing him to give up his own eye for Nidhogg to use to exact his revenge, and even after he's finally killed during <em>Heavensward</em>, his essence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">consumes the current Azure Dragoon</a> when he comes into possession of both of his eyes.</span>

In truth, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Somnus was a man who yearned to be special and loved and grew to envy his older brother Ardyn. This made it easier for him to follow the Astrals' plan to make Ardyn into the Starscourge's avatar, which entailed Somnus betraying his brother, killing the Oracle Aera (Ardyn's betrothed) when she got in the way, and sealing his brother in a prison for thousands of years. Ultimately, Somnus was less a hero and more the Astrals' pawn. At the end of the <em>Ardyn</em> DLC when Somnus is defeated by Ardyn, Somnus is reduced to a broken spirit who can only beg his brother for understanding (even he realizes he can't ask for forgiveness)</span>.

<ul><li> Parodied on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> sketch that shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> practicing with a bo staff and declares "For America!" at the very end.
<ul><li> A different, but similar, sketch had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> done in the style of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><em>"1776! It ain't accurate, but it'll blow your fucking mind!"</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> Jebediah Springfield on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Touted as an archetypal pioneer who killed bears with his bare hands, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was in fact a German pirate who once tried to off George Washington but got his ass kicked.</span>
<ul><li> And even before that was revealed, the narrator of the TV recreation showing a man dressed as a pioneer fighting a man in a bear suit says: <em>"but modern historians think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">that was the bear who killed him</a>"</em>
</li><li> Among many tall tales about Jebediah Springfield, one says that he tamed a wild buffalo by himself and in a matter of seconds, and another that he started the tradition of Springfield's Wacking Day by killing a snake in 1775 (the Springfeldians considered this a good thing at the time). In reality: he killed the buffalo, and Whacking Day was invented in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">1924</a> as an excuse to beat up the Irish. At least it is true that he did not want men to marry their cousins.
</li><li> "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star" ends with a flashforward to 3005 AD, showing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Bart</a> is now revered as the Last Prophet of God. Unfortunately, the world is engulfed in a war between those who think he taught love and tolerance, and those who think he taught understanding and peace.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents">Fairly OddParents</a></em> has Timmy wanting to make a parade float based on legendary Dimmsdale founder Dale Dimm; AJ scoffs at him, declaring Dale Dimm to be just a legend and wanting to base their float on Alden Bitterroot, who is given actual historical credit for founding Dimmsdale. It turns out they both sucked. When Timmy travels back in time, it turns out Dale IS real, but a moron who is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">accidental</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> AT BEST, and Alden Bitterroot is an obsessive and delusional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">witch hunter</a>, identical ancestor of Crocker (who is actually a real witch himself and even more of an evil pain than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">Identical Grandson</a>!).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>: Initially, in "Irrational Treasure", presumed founder of Gravity Falls Nathaniel Northwest was, in reality, a waste-shoveling village idiot that the government used to hide the <em>real</em> founder of Gravity Falls, America's 8th and 1/2 President Quentin Trembley. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, that was merely the tip of the iceberg — Northwest and his wife gain untold amounts of wealth with the cover-up, along with a mayoral position, and then used the townspeople to build Northwest Manor with the promise of a party every year celebrating their hard work. The people built the manor, only to be betrayed and denied entrance to the party for the next 150 years. This was the <em>first</em> of the many lies and deceit the Northwests, Gravity Falls' supposed "first family", has been involved in since then — a fact that Pacifica Northwest is very much horrified to find out</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, the original Mewman colonists like to describe themselves as having bravely fought a war to purge the land of evil monsters so they could live in peace. The obvious subtext is that the monsters were the natives being driven from their lands by a superior force, and that history was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>.
<ul><li> One queen in particular stands out, Solaria the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Monster Carver</a> is portrayed as stalwart hero who defended mewman lands from monsters in their history but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicBookOfSpells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicBookOfSpells">The Magic Book of Spells</a> reveals that she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">hatred</a> for monsters that exceeded even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">rest</a> of Mewni and would even lead genocidal purges into monster lands when they stopped attacking.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Steven steadily realizes that the Crystal Gems have done this a bit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Rose Quartz</a>; she <em>was</em> a hero who was willing to sacrifice everything to protect Earth, but the Crystal Gems (out of a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> and wanting to protect Steven) have left out many of her flaws, making her out as if she was some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>. As heroic as Rose was, she was also a warrior and commander of an army who had to repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> for the sake of the greater good, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bubbling Bismuth and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">covering up</a> her fate when the latter showed signs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a></span>. They also left out the fact that it took a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for Rose to become such a good person, as it's implied she originally saw humans as little more than cute animals. In truth, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rose Quartz was originally called Pink Diamond, and came to Earth to oversee its colonization, a process that would've wiped out humanity. She eventually had a change of heart and created her new identity of Rose Quartz in order to lead a rebellion against her homeworld's government, even faking her own assassination in a misguided attempt to end the war quickly. Instead, it led the other diamonds to retaliate with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Fantastic Nuke</a> that corrupted nearly all gems on Earth into mindless monsters. Rose Quartz spent thousands of years trying to atone for what she's done, culminating in her essentially dying in order to create Steven, a half-gem half-human who might some day become powerful enough to cure the corruption</span>.
