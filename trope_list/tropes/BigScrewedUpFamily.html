<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> Family. Almost all of them are orphans brought together by tragedy. First <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing">Dick</a> was raised by Bruce and suffered tension to the point that they seemed ready to break. Then Bruce took in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Jason</a>, who was ultimately killed (and brought back to become a wayward son). Barbara was crippled and had to rebuild her life as a paraplegic superheroine. Tim volunteered and his family fell apart for it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra</a> was drugged into becoming the very thing she feared most, Stephanie was tortured half to death, it took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Helena</a> years before she gained acceptance and started to trust the others, and Damian's problems start with being raised in a clan of assassins... they're all waifs, misfits, and strays that would belong nowhere if not together.
</li><li> The Wilsons. Slade "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a>" Wilson may actually be the only <em>sane</em> one left. His wife, Addie, was ostensibly on the side of angels, but her methods weren't. They only seemed to get worse with time. Eldest son Grant was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> who ended up killing himself when going up against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a>. Middle child Joseph "Jericho" Wilson was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a>; a genuinely nice, artistic sort and a Titan in good standing...until he made contact with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven">Raven</a>'s demonic side and the corrupted remnants of Azarath and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">went nuts as a result</a>. Rose, the youngest, and the product of Slade's affair with a brothel keeper/mercenary gouged her own eye out in an attempt to be just like daddy (that, before her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>). So yeah.

<ul><li> The Osborns. First we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>, an already unhinged businessman who was severely neglectful and emotionally abusive to his son Harry throughout his childhood before becoming the murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin">Green Goblin</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied">killed Gwen Stacy</a>, among other things. Harry grew up to be a drug addict, a divorcee, and generally mentally unstable. After his dad apparently died, Harry didn't take it too well and ended up becoming the second Green Goblin himself. Then there's Normie Osborn, Harry's young son who was kidnapped by his grandfather in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoDownSwinging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoDownSwinging">Go Down Swinging</a></em> storyline and forcibly bonded to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a> symbiote, becoming "Goblin Childe". And to top this all off, Harry's mother Emily was eventually retconned as having faked her death to escape Norman.

The two boys were parachuted out of the plane by their mother and the landing caused a head injury to Scott which rendered him unable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">control</a> his mutant ability. After being abducted Christopher and Katherine's third son Gabriel was ripped out of his mother by evil alien D'ken after he killed her, which led to Gabriel being artificially aged, raised/used as a slave by the Shi'ar, end up trapped on Krakoa while it got sent into space and promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">going nuts</a>, murdering D'Ken, becoming evil and marrying Deathbird. Back on Earth, Scott had a baby with the clone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> created by Mr. Sinister aka Madelyne Pryor.

Also, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em>, there's Cable's counterpart and half-brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">Nate Grey</a>, made from Scott and Jean's genetic material by Mr. Sinister (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">can't get enough</a> of Scott and Jean) to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a> directed at Apocalypse and then burn out and die afterwards, who migrated over to the main reality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers">Rachel Summers</a> is Scott and Jean's daughter from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">dystopian alternate reality</a> who's compared (by Wolverine, who would know) to a Holocaust survivor, and from another alternate reality, there's Ruby Summers, because Scott <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">can never keep it in his pants</a> and slept with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> giving birth to Ruby (Ditto for Megan Summers). It's also worth noting a lot of these heroes in this family like Cyclops and Havok and Jean (and Nate, though his was at least well-intentioned) have all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned evil</a> at some point.

<ul><li> Tyler Stone, former lover of Conchata O'Hara, and father of Kron Stone and Miguel O'Hara, is THE supervillain of the setting. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> of the highest order, he's single-handedly responsible for most of the bad things that happen in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099">Marvel 2099</a></em> universe. His business tactics include human experimentation, firing people with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">prejudice</a>", and forcing drugs on his employees (as shown with his own son, Miguel). In addition, he's all but stated to have murdered his wife, was abusive to Kron, and at different points he decides to experiment on and/or kill both his sons.
</li><li> Kron Stone started as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> - an extremely aggressive one. Already having attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">kill Miguel since childhood</a>, as an adult he becomes a serial killer, and tries once again to kill both Tyler Stone and Miguel. Eventually he becomes Venom 2099.
</li><li> Conchata O'Hara is a clinically insane woman (though it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>) who also has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousCriminalHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousCriminalHistory">Ambiguous Criminal History</a>. She is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Abusive Parent</a> to Miguel, clearly favouring her other son Gabriel over him, and physically abusing Miguel even as an adult. She also commits several crimes on-screen, including illegal substance abuse, grand theft auto, blackmail, attempted murder and attempted suicide. And the victim of the blackmail and murder? Tyler Stone.
</li><li> Conchata's husband, George O'Hara, is hardly any better. He is an extremely negative portrayal of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFiftiesFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFiftiesFather">Standard '50s Father</a>, physically abusive to his wife and Miguel (whom he uses as a means to advance his career), while being demeaning and neglectful towards Gabriel. He is also very racist in an era that's portrayed to have largerly forgotten such attitudes. While it's not shown, the abuse got so bad that Miguel honestly thought about killing him at a point, but decided not to because he wanted him to rot of old age instead just so he would suffer.
</li><li> Miguel O'Hara is Spider-Man, but before that he was <em>just</em> a hair away from becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> himself. Miguel is convinced that insanity runs in the family, and as Spider-Man he is highly aggressive and reacts extremely with extreme violence under emotional distress. He also contemplates patricide (towards both Tyler and George) a few times over, and openly calls his mother a "crazy woman".
</li><li> Gabriel O'Hara seems to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in his family, but he's very jealous and very angry towards Miguel, to the point that he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> for the identity of Green Goblin 2099. He's also a cybernet (read virtual reality) addict, and has a tendency to attract highly questionable girlfriends, occasionally blaming Miguel for his relationship troubles (and he's partially right too).

<ul><li> The House of Atreus is the best example. Menelaus is the <em>only</em> adult member who doesn't commit some sort of unforgivable crime. Except for that time in <em>Andromache</em> when he threatened to murder her child if she didn't come out and admit she was bewitching his daughter Hermione, who was no bag of sunshine herself so that she would be barren; the plan was, naturally, to kill both Andromache and her little boy. Of course, that characterization can be attributed to Euripides's dislike of Sparta at the time.
</li><li> The House of Thebes is another cursed dynasty. While the founder of the House Cadmus did quite well for himself and married Harmonia, the daughter of Ares, <em>all</em> of their descendants fared poorly. The most famous ones are of course Oedipus and company mentioned in the Theater folder.
<ul><li> The line being cursed is a result of Hephaestus. Harmonia wasn't just Ares's daughter, she was Aphrodite's as well, the wife of Hephaestus, and she had given up immortality for Cadmus. After realizing Harmonia was not his, he made a cursed necklace and gave it to her. The necklace became a family heirloom and brought disaster among the descendants.

Incest, necrophilia, necromancy, cannibalism and human trafficking are only the tip of the iceberg. One of the sourcebooks outright states that the Giovanni are pretty much the inbred, cannibalistic hillbilly clan from your favorite slasher flick, only with Italian accents and enough money to buy small nations. And several of the Giovanni associate families, like the Crassus revenants or the Dunsirns, are <em>worse</em> than the Giovannis proper.

</li><li> At one point or another, <em>every</em> ruling family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has been like this. House Liao is probably the most obviously screwed up, with a long history of internecine familial conflict up to and including secession, terrorism, assassination and abortive coups (all in the same generation even). The Kuritas of the Draconis Combine are also notorious for killing each other off to ascend to the Coordinatorship, and while there are many members of the family with diverse goals, these too spend most of their time putting on an external visage of cooperation while attempting mutual treachery behind closed doors. The Clan invasion dampened this tendency somewhat, but it probably says something that a minor member of the ruling family far from succession who was quietly plotting in the background to weaken their enemy, the Clans, via cultural and psychological warfare was suspected of conspiring to claim the throne instead, and was nearly assassinated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a> for <em>helping</em> his nation.

Even members of the same blood house were known to plot against each other politically, which was seen as especially serious business.
</li><li> The Shiawase clan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>, and by extension the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> that bears their name. Shiawase (the corporation) prides itself on its 'corporate family' image, where employees are born, baptised, married and buried under the aegis of the corporation and considered 'part of the family'. Naturally, this means it's the mega most prone to infighting, as family members (both literal and figurative) struggle over their shared fortunes. Shadowrunners can make good money exploiting this tendency.

<ul><li> The 2002 film adaptation just makes matters worse by styling the brothers as camp cyber-punk/glam-rock types and ramping up the incestuous subtext (e.g. the Duchess and Junior after Junior is arrested, not to mention Ambitioso and Supervacuo's somewhat excessive hand-holding and pawing at each other)

Juliet's father decides to marry her off against her wishes a day after her cousin gets killed, to "cheer her up", and when Juliet protests he threatens to let her "beg, starve, die on the streets!"

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoEtJulietteDeLaHaineALamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoEtJulietteDeLaHaineALamour">musical</a> went ahead and added incest (by some people's standards) into the mix by presenting Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, as <em>also</em> being in love with her. The Hungarian adaptation of the musical took this even further by making him epileptic (probably as a result of an injury incurred as part of his harsh, almost military upbringing as a designated champion for his family in their feud with the Montagues — who interestingly <em>don't</em> seem to fit this trope) <em>and</em> having a pervasive level of sexual tension with Lady Capulet, who at least knows well enough to firmly turn him down when he tries to lunge at her and kiss her.

The Kurain Master position is usually held by the oldest daughter of the Master, but Misty Fey turned out to be more powerful than her sister Morgan and stole the position out from under her, dooming Morgan Fey to become the "branch family".

<ul><li> The Jahad Family, comprised of the King of the Tower and his adopted daughters, is by nature of the adoption requirements full of rather peculiar individuals, but the most disturbing thing is that there is a strict rule against romance, dating, and sex that is enforced with the threat of assassination.
</li><li> The Khun family, which is quite the inverse: The family head, Khun Edahn, is a notorious playboy and has the greatest amount of wives throughout the whole tower. His children are basically uncountable so that when two meet they have to confirm that they really are of the same family, despite rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindow">obvious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">signs</a>. Family branches easily fall out of grace and Khun Aguero Agnes's experiences with his family lead him to mistrust everybody. Children who don't win a competition against one of their brothers get kicked out of the family at the tender age of ten.
</li><li> Finally, there is the Hendrock family. The name of the head, Hendrock Bloodmadder, is fitting. The less you know about them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">the better</a>.

<ul><li> Valois/Sturmvoraus/Other-Last-Names-in-the-Line clan look like this.

According to Tarvek, the only way to keep them in line would be to bury them in a cemetery. Oh, and his sister slowly died because their father tried to upload into her brain a copy of the insane lady he was infatuated with. And the level of abuse his distant cousin Violetta constantly piles on Tarvek from her introduction on was already adjusted for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the discovery that he pulled her butt out of a big meat grinder</span> not long before. And Violetta's deeply moved by the death of one particular relative, because she's <em>pretty</em> sure Aunt Margolotta never tried to kill her... or at least never tried very hard, which by Sturmvoraus standards is "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20141208">She was always nice to me<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".

</div></li><li> The Heterodyne family <em>was</em> known primarily for their bloodthirsty and tyrannical ways until Bill and Barry gave the family a bit of an image makeover with their heroics. Armored toys in the nursery is a telltale sign, though little iron cages were used more sparingly.
</li><li> The Mongfishes aren't much better. Case in point: Lucrezia and her sister Serpentina. Then the rest of their clan trying to subvert Lucrezia's minions and hijack her scheme — not because they disagree about the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> thing, they only want a good share of its fruits.
</li><li> And then there's Lucrezia and her other sister, Demonica, not to mention Demonica's daughter Zola. During a complicated argument between The Other and Zola, she simply asks why Zola, whom she'd knocked out, strapped down and prepared to hijack with her own brain, doesn't just give her the information she needed earlier. Zola's only response is a meaningful silence.

After forcing Sil'lice into hiding, they tainted Nishi'kanta by force. And the Vloz'ress clan: fronted by an insanely powerful sorceress with the mind of a child who likes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDollCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDollCollector">turn people into dolls</a> and can swallow the auras of others, now led by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kiel, who is the equivalent of fifteen or sixteen</span>, and pretty much tainted to the core.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>: The Bagges as a family have equal shares in baldness, glasses and heartlessness especially when combined with a fell need for profit. Ma Bagge who is the oldest seen member certainly paved the way that her two sons would tread. The oldest named Horst was encouraged by her to prove himself through being a hunter (of sapient deer) and make a fortune through any means (as she herself did as an unscrupulous wig-making executive), which for him ended up meaning stealing the mountain-land from the population of goats and kicking them off a cliff. The younger, Eustace, was simply neglected and abused as he was considered unworthy and incapable of anything great, which in a way encouraged him to end up an unhappy, miserable jerk who...likewise abuses his dog Courage and isn't kind to almost anyone and has his fair share of crimes motivated by greed and spite like the rest of his family, just less successfully.
</li><li> The Lanes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> certainly qualify. The parents are never home, leaving major character Jane and brother Trent to fend for themselves. Speaking of them, while Jane is comparatively normal, she's still quite jaded, while Trent is a lazy burnout who's never worked a day in his life. The rest of the kids are even worse: Penny is bitter and spends most of her time peddling handcrafts, Wind is an overemotional man who's been divorced at least 3 times, Summer is worn down by raising 3 out-of-control kids, and the rest of their family hates them, including an alcoholic self-proclaimed bum, and a grandmother who screams "What the Hell is wrong with you?" into Jane's ear.
</li><li> Ed and Eddy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> are implied to have bad families. The former has parents who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PushoverParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PushoverParents">his mother is seemingly far too submissive to his bratty little sister Sarah</a> and the latter has two abusive parents who berate him for his bad grades and an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">abusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">Big Brother Bully</a></span>.
<ul><li> Interestingly averted with Double D, not only because of his being an only son but while it's implied that his parents are hardly ever around, being so busy with work that they mostly communicate with him through sticky notes, they do at least do <em>somewhat</em> care for him with said notes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Griffin family in later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> have become a complete incarnate of this trope. To the point where they're just as screwed-up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">the Barones</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>: The Northwest Family are very reputable throughout Gravity Falls, but we get hints about them not being as good as they appear: Pacifica's jerk behavior, and her father Preston's "encouragement" of his daughter: "You're a Northwest. Don't lose." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it turns out the whole family has been one 150-year-long line of cheats and swindlers, starting with their distant ancestor Nathaniel Northwest, who was chosen as a "patsy mayor" and seems to have amassed his fortune based on a fake reputation as a pioneer hero. Preston himself is a classist creep who was willing to endanger his party guests by not following through on an old curse and let the townspeople enjoy a party, just to maintain his sophisticated image. Not to mention treating Pacifica like a dog, including controlling her <em>Pavlov-style</em> with a bell, and encouraging her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> attitude. Pacifica herself seems to be averting this, putting aside her prejudices and ending the 150-year-old curse by opening her family's party to the town. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Her name means 'Peaceful', after all.</a></span>
</li><li> The Patakis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>. Abusive father, alcoholic mother, one daughter that pretends to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">perfect girl</a> is massively messed up on the inside, and another daughter that's overly grumpy, and, compared to the rest, looks like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in this screwed-up setting. Not really big as a family, but quite big in name, though. It's the nearest of a really screwed-up family one could see in a kids' show. Interestingly, both Helga and Olga each see each other as "getting the better deal from their parents". Helga just wants to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">noticed</a></em> by her parents, darn it! But they're too busy pouring all their love and adoration on her perfect older sister Olga. Unfortunately, Olga (who is <em>not</em> perfect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">she just seems that way</a>) is being crushed under her parents' ridiculously high standards, and a lifetime of this has turned her into a neurotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>, deathly afraid of even the slightest hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade">The B Grade</a>. She is incredibly envious of Helga's freedom to be her own person, away from the ever-watchful eyes of her parents.

They're not above annoying each other whenever. Then there's Shendu's relationship with his son Drago. In the finale, while they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel">Sealed Evil in a Duel</a>, Shendu admonishes Drago for trying to take over his father's world while Drago complains about how Shendu was always off fighting wizards.

Clay is an alcoholic that thinks abuse is how you show love, and is estranged from his father Arthur after Arthur blamed him for his mother's death (which to be fair, is a fair cop). Bloberta is a neat freak who had her own brush with alcoholism (and sent Clay on his path), only married Clay so she can feel needed, and cheated on him at least once and tried to do so again. The one time we know Bloberta cheated on Clay resulted in younger son Shapey, who's still breastfed at <em>seven</em> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until near the end of the series</span> only spoke in screeches and one-word sentences, and was accidentally swapped for another boy and neither parent either noticed or cared. Orel is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, but that doesn't mean much when his attempts of following God's word end up setting the town on fire, or killing a woman, or causing a zombie apocalypse. Of course, this is just ONE family in a Big Screwed-Up <em>Town</em>.
