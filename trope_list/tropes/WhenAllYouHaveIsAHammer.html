Unfortunately, this strategy ends up being "Just do what you always do, but slightly better." It's not that our hero is uninventive. He may be an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyver</a>, but he just doesn't have much to work with.
</p><p>Most often, this offensive capability ends up being "punch the other guy really hard", and the "solution" to the current dilemma is "punch the other guy really hard <em>in the face</em>."
</p><p>Sometimes, this is a little more elaborate, and the hero has to do something totally different. <em>Then</em> he gets to fall back on his usual strategy. "Cast 'dispel invulnerability' on him. Then punch the other guy really hard. <em>In the face.</em>"
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Occasionally it happens because of complacency; the character does have other abilities/methods to do the job, but they have used "the hammer" so much to be really effective with it, and thus those other methods are largely redundant for them (save for special occasions). Especially true for a given character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a> and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">it's part of the work's premise.</a> See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">Complacent Gaming Syndrome</a> for cases of video game players about this.
</p><p>A justification can be that there are many ways to arrive at what looks like the same conclusion. For example, all of General Patton's strategies were elaborate ways to shoot stuff with tanks, and all successful modern infantry tactics end the same way: "and then we shoot them/call in the artillery."

If he loses a battle it's not because he needs to strengthen or do more training like with the shōnen protagonists that come after him: he's just hitting them wrong. Once that's figured out, he hits them and they explode like they're supposed to.
</li><li> Light Yagami's only weapon is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath">It kills people</a>. It has a few functions related to the task (which Light exploits the hell out of), but in the end, all it <em>really does</em> is kill people, so every crime tends to receive the same punishment.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em> frequently fell into the pattern of having a monster require a clever strategy to weaken it, but then it was always time to form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">the blazing sword</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> is fully defeated by a clever stratagem... but then Speedy performs his standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> finishing move anyway, because it's in his contract that he gets to do it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> in general. Oh no! A giant that could kill us all with a flick of his wrist is coming at us... well, time to get out the cards.

GX</a></em>: Kaiser was the epitome of this trope, before he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> and got new cards. His entire strategy consisted of summoning Cyber End Dragon OVER AND OVER again.
</li><li> In fact, most main characters in all six series to date will typically default to strategies built on their signature cards to win the big duels, even if other options are available. Kaiba never let a duel pass without summoning at least one Blue Eyes White Dragon, if not all three.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba:</strong> "Mokuba, what do I always tell you? If at first you don't succeed... BLAST IT WITH YOUR BLUE EYES AGAIN!"
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>: The town is threatened by duelists wielding the Machine Emperors, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfKryptonite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfKryptonite">are designed to defeat Synchro monsters</a>. Yusei suggests everyone practice dueling without using Synchro monsters. He duels Jack Atlas for practice, but Jack declares this is stupid and summons his Red Daemon's Dragon anyway. When the others call him out on this and point out his dragon will be vulnerable to the Machine Emperors, Jack declares he doesn't care who his opponent is, he'll defeat them with his Synchro monsters. Later in the series, Yusei and Jack gain new Synchro monsters that can avoid the Machine Emperors' effects.
</li><li> While characters clearly have favorite monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, they will gladly use other hammers as needed. They just prefer to use their favorite hammers when possible.
</li><li> The protagonist and rival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em> generally avert this, as they have more ace cards they can choose between and bring out different ones in specific duels. They have some they favor over others true, but compared to most protagonists they avert this trope. It helps both of them can pull cards out of thin air when needed to give them more ace cards and support monsters for those ace monsters. Soulburner on the other hand plays this straight as he does not have the ability to create new cards on the fly: his strategy is using Salamagreat Heatleo and supporting that process until the enemy is down.
</li></ul></li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">NERV</a> as a whole, Unit 01 is this. Got an Angel that can't be beaten? Throw Shinji at it. Shinji can't beat it? Piss Shinji off. There are a couple aversions, but generally Unit 01 is treated as the Ultimate Hammer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There's a very good reason for this, since Unit 01 is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>.</span> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstructive</a> nature of <em>Evangelion</em> comes from the horrific psychological toll that this treatment (along with everything else he goes through) takes on Shinji's mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> uses this trope a lot. About a fifth of the way into the series, the title character learns this nifty technique called a "Rasengan" and from then on whenever he encounters a problem he infallibly resorts to punching it in the face with this technique. If that doesn't work, 9 times out of 10 he resorts to some <em>variation</em> of it to win.
<ul><li> <em>Before</em> he learned Rasengan, Naruto's favorite (only) tactic was to bum rush with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">shadow clones</a> a lot. When that by itself inevitably failed, he would use it in combination with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">his disguises</a> to sneak his real self into position while his clones distracted the villain.
</li><li> Generally speaking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck">a lot of the time</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">everyone sticks to what they're good at</a>. However, the trade-off is that most of these abilities overlap. For example, Naruto's favorite technique is Shadow Clone Jutsu. While he is by far the most proficient user of the technique, <a class="urllink" href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Special:BrowseData/Jutsu?Jutsu_classification=Bunshinjutsu">there are a ton of abilities that do a similar effect.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0l4tj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0l4tj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0l4tj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though the Shadow Clone Jutsu <em>is</em> the most versatile of this type; other jutsu to produce physical (rather than illusory) clones require actually having whatever substance the clones are made from on hand, while Shadow Clones are made entirely out of chakra. For somebody like Naruto who has a ridiculously large chakra capacity, that means he always produce as many clones as he needs for a given scenario, and can always make more when they're destroyed.</span> The same is true of other types of techniques, and most of the best ninja tend to find ways to copy abilities from others using their unique skill set. For example, if there's an ability too difficult for Naruto to pull off, he usually uses a shadow clone to assist and comes with his own unique variant.

He did this until he finally makes a fire blast too big for the enemy to control, thus winning the fight.
<ul><li> Another time, Natsu faced an opponent whose wind armor countered his fire magic. The winning solution? Make more fire.

This is especially painfully obvious in the episode where Ash fights Brock for the Boulder Badge. What does he do when his Pikachu can't beat Brock in a straight fight? He charges his Pikachu up with MORE ELECTRICITY!. Misty offers to loan him a water Pokémon, which would have solved the problem and is the obvious solution. Ash goes with the lightning because he's stubborn and still a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a>. <br/><br/>When he faced Drake, the leader of the Orange Crew, Ash used this tactic to take down Drake's first Pokémon. That first Pokémon was a Ditto that would copy the appearance and moves of its opponent, which caught Ash and Pikachu off guard when the match began. Misty suggested that Ash change Pokémon, but he pointed out that Ditto would simply change shape again into whichever Pokémon he sent out next. He eventually defeated the Ditto by simply having Pikachu blast it with everything he had, realizing that while the Ditto might have copied Pikachu's abilities, it couldn't copy Pikachu's power level and couldn't take as much punishment. <br/><br/>The <em>Sun and Moon</em> series does bother to try downplay this, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> format of many episodes involves situations where the protagonists want to solve a problem pacifistically, meaning instances of them often still utilising their Pokémon's abilities, but achieving their ends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">through cunning</a> rather than raw power. Compared to the standard "Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!" climax of many previous series' episodes, one has the gang deal with a hungry Morelull absorbing the team's life energy. Ash however pities it and solves the problem by eating enough food for it to absorb and fill off of him. Another has Jigglypuff livid when Komala seemingly sleeps through its singing (it sleeps <em>constantly</em> by default). Despite Komala being able to easily outmanoeuvre Jigglypuff, the group know battling won't end it's vendetta, so instead teach Komala to mimic it's Sing ability in it's sleep, making Jigglypuff think it's joining it's performance.

<ul><li> Saito Hajime follows the philosophy that a warrior does not need several special moves. He needs only a single move refined to the point of perfection. Thus, his only named attack is the Gatotsu and uses variations when the situation calls for them. Opponent above you? Gatotsu third form. Opponent in point-blank range? Gatotsu zero form. Need to bust down a door? Gatotsu. Need to clear rubble? Gatotsu, of course! In the final series of battles, when Saito's "perfect" attack is foiled by his opponent and Gatotsu is defeated (or so the opponent thinks), Saito shows that all he needs is a slight variation in his move to win.

<ul><li> In the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Clark</a>'s powers are limited to invulnerability, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, his default attack is "throw the villain hard at something". In season two he gains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">heat vision</a>, but his default attack is unchanged because it would otherwise be messy. As his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> increases, he seems to start using "punching you at Mach 10" more often against tougher opponents. Hey, it worked even on Brainiac, Zor-El and Zod! Not to mention he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">took down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> with one of those</span>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> is a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> offender, almost every episode requiring that they devise some special technique to render the monster defeatable by one of the stock finishing moves. Several noteworthy examples:
<ul><li> The second season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, Z-Putties, were completely indestructible unless you knew their weakness. This weakness: being punched really hard at a point in the middle of their chest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">which is conveniently marked</a></em>. (Despite learning this weakness during their first encounter, the heroes never aimed for it immediately, which would've made the show both realistic and boring.) This once led to them being defeated by <em>ten-year-olds with dodgeballs</em>.
</li><li> In another early episode, the Power Rangers are faced with evil doubles that they aren't able to beat, so Zordon gives them new weapons... which look <em>exactly</em> like their old weapons. (Specifically, they're stronger versions meant to overpower the Mutant Rangers' weapons)
</li><li> <em>SPD</em>, "Reflections": Sam, who can turn into a ball of light, realizes that a monster's weakness is the mirrors built into its chest. So, is his brilliant tactical strategy to somehow leverage his light-form to turn those mirrors into a liability? Nope, the answer is "punch him really hard in the chest."
</li><li> <em>Operation Overdrive</em>:
<ul><li> "Man of Mercury": Future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, Tyzonn, has the power to turn himself into mercury, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">T-1000</a> style. Faced with the need to stop an alien army from escaping their imprisonment in a mirror, you might think that he'll use the reflective qualities of his mercury form in some way, as he'd been seen to do a few scenes earlier. He does end up using his powers: he extends his reach and smashes the mirror. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> writers seem inordinately fond of smashing mirrors.
</li><li> A different example is pointed out in at least one review of the episode "Both Sides Now" in which the Black Ranger seemingly defects for the purpose of stealing back an artifact from the bad guys. While it's clear that it wouldn't have gone as smoothly if the Rangers didn't have a career criminal on their team, it's also likely that they would never have even thought to try the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> plot if someone with Will's skill set wasn't around.
</li></ul></li><li> But <em>finally</em> something different in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>: "Doctor K": Faced with a monster that can duplicate anything it can reflect in its mirror, Dr. K does a well-timed feint, causing it to duplicate not her weapon, but a generator the rangers need two of. Still, it wouldn't be <em>Power Rangers</em> without falling back on the old chestnut. While all this is going on, the Rangers defeat a larger version of the same monster by a well-placed flying kick to the chest-mirrors.
</li></ul></li><li> The only weapon on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx">Lexx</a></em> is a planet-destroying wave, as such the ship and its crew have a tendency to solve problems by blowing up planets. Like in the third TV movie where the <em>Lexx</em> scrapes a parasite off its skin by destroying the planet they were on and flying into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">debris field</a>.
</li><li> Despite being surprisingly sophisticated in its character drama and plot development, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainPowerAndTheSoldiersOfTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainPowerAndTheSoldiersOfTheFuture">Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future</a></em> was prone to resolving all its moments of suspense by the simple expedient of having it turn out that the heroes were not hurt quite so badly as it had at first appeared.
</li><li> Several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, when the story required a less than super character to handle a situation on their own, it was suggested that Buffy sit that one out as it didn't require slaying, citing Buffy's tendency to respond to even minor conflict with violence. And while she has quite a repertoire, her go-to weapon is a good-ol' pointy stick.
<div class="indent"><strong>Buffy:</strong> Why don't I just put a stake through [Anyanka's] heart? <br/><strong>Giles:</strong> She's not a vampire. <br/><strong>Buffy:</strong> You'd be surprised how many things that'll kill.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>: Lily Aldrin solves all of life's problems by treating them as she would in a kindergarten class and recommends her friends do the same.
</li><li> Claude Raines stopped Peter Petrelli from turning New York into rubble in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> with a well-placed right cross. Given that he was played by Christopher Eccleston, it was awesome. This is similar to the method used to stop the alien villain in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> serial "City of Death."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>: Frank has a gun.

It's the only reason anybody ever does anything he says.
</li><li> Cameron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em>, being a literal killing machine, tends to view any problem in the context of how many people she has to kill, treating alternative methods with anything from bemusement to derision. That she is willing to apply other methods as the series progresses is an important point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, the eponymous city is invaded by aliens in powered armor who have come to steal a device. During their escape, one provides cover by throwing up an energy shield which blocks bullets. Undaunted by this, the heroes unload on this guy for nearly 30 seconds, eventually breaking the shield and killing him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted: sure, all the Doctor has is a sonic screwdriver, but it has more features than a Swiss army knife with extra hammer space. If we're to judge by <em>Doctor Who</em>, the grand unifying theory of science is that everything is controlled by screws. In fact, it was temporarily taken off the show because it was feared it would become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, so to speak. Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">it doesn't do wood</a>. Also, it's specifically never used to solve the episode's big problem. And in the revival series, the Doctor rarely uses the same trick twice to solve the episode's big problem.
</li><li> Ten references this in one of his audiobooks as the reason he never carries a weapon. "If all you have is a gun, then all you see are things to destroy, and that's not who I am." It's not that he doesn't think there are situations that call for violence, he just doesn't want to risk it becoming his first resort. When all you have is an amazing intellect, and tools to get you access to all the most relevant data on what's going on, things are much less likely to end in a tragic misunderstanding.
</li><li> In the Classic series, the Doctor is always ridiculing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">The Brigadier</a>'s tendency to use military force to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>. Of course, he's simply using the tools he knows well; it's the job of his "scientific advisor' to come up with other options.
</li><li> The Daleks were very clearly designed with one purpose in mind: Exterminate. They were given two appendages, neither of which even functions as a hand: a gun, and a plunger like device that can interface with technology (and even that can be used to kill). While early episodes showed that they <em>can</em> stun someone, it rarely comes up as an option; their general tactics are kill, kill, and kill some more. Even when performing tasks like interrogating someone who would have willingly shared intel with them, they make it lethal because it's what they do.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rose:</strong> You didn't need to kill him! <br/><strong>Dalek:</strong> Neither did we need him alive.
</div></li><li> Eleven and Twelve's manservant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Strax</a> cannot help himself but suggest violence to solve the situation. Not problem, but situation. Like getting everyone to sit down for dinner on time. It's literally in his DNA.
<div class="indent"><strong>Drax:</strong> The Doctor said to ask if you needed any grenades. He may have said "help".
</div></li></ul></li><li> Across assorted TV and live shows, Australian comedy troupe the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DougAnthonyAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DougAnthonyAllStars">Doug Anthony All Stars</a> had a running gag involving moral dilemmas, each of which would describe a particular quandary in varying amounts of detail, including situations involving alcoholism, losing a job and so on. The last line of each dilemma was inevitably "You have... a hammer." Except for unwanted pregnancies where it ends with "You have... <strong>a coathanger.</strong>"
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> will often claim to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">a plan</a> to solve the current crisis. If any of the other characters bother to ask for details, it usually involves going in the front door of the bad guy's lair and stabbing it/them. (In another humorous case, the plan to avoid security was "walk really fast", and then, stab something.)
</li><li> How many times did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrektheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrektheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em>'s Captain Kirk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFistForgivesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFistForgivesYou">punch an offending alien in the face?</a> Or order his crew to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">fire phasers?</a> Handheld phasers borders between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryDeviceIsASwissArmyKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryDeviceIsASwissArmyKnife">Every Device Is a Swiss-Army Knife</a> and this trope — on the one hand they can be used in a fair number of non-weapon ways (plus, they can serve as improvised explosives), but on the other hand a lot of problems were solved by firing at someone/something until it fell down/exploded/disintegrated.
</li><li> There is an interesting variation on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LeverageS03E11TheRashomonJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LeverageS03E11TheRashomonJob">The Rashomon Job</a>" where each of the various thieves tried to steal the same rare dagger on the same night using their designated skills and inadvertently sabotaged each other, only to realize that the mastermind of the group had really ended up with it. This was before any of them ever really met, mind. it also turned out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the dagger was really a fake and that it was all just an insurance scam</span>. Eliot often plays this straight as well. His primary means of gaining a proper disguise is to beat up the person wearing it and steal it.

And a "violent" variant from the same: if a myth is even tangentially related to explosions, there <em>will</em> be an explosion, even if they have to resort to calling in the bomb squad.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episode <em>Meltdown</em>, Pythagoras believes there is a solution to the war, possibly involving triangles. Einstein is annoyed saying "Always with the triangles".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: John Sheridan's motto appears to be, "When in doubt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption">nuclear warheads</a>." No wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy">Syfy</a> keeps hiring Boxleitner for their similarly inclined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SyfyOriginalMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SyfyOriginalMovie">movies</a>. (To be fair to Sheridan, though, he never uses nukes in the same manner twice, and he's got plenty of other tactics in his bag of tricks that he's perfectly willing to use.)
</li><li> Jeremy Clarkson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> is particularly fond of hammers, using them at every opportunity even when it's not the best idea in the world.
<div class="indent"> <strong>James:</strong> Don't hit it with the hammer. <br/><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Why not? <br/><strong>James:</strong> Because it's the tool of a pikey.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some specialist wizards are more specialized than others. Necromancers at least have Black and White arts (not much), Summoners have acid arrows and suchlike, but what sort of spells do you think a Fire Elementalist is going to have? Protection from fire, hurling fire, breathing fire, beating with fire, fire wall, fire cloud, fire trap and... and... yeah, right, that's about it.
</li><li> Specialist wizards could sacrifice breadth of knowledge for depth. By forsaking two (of eight) schools of magic, the Wizard chose one other school and gained a special spell slot at each spell level that could only hold a school from his chosen school. A splatbook adds the "Focused Specialist" class variant in which a wizard could sacrifice a <em>third</em> school to gain two <em>more</em> spell slots for their chosen school (for three extra slots total...at the cost of forbidding the wizard to use roughly 1/3 of the spells on his class list).
</li><li> Other (typically less useful) classes also forced specialization on individual characters. For instance, Shugenja had to forbid a quarter of their class list from their class list, Warlocks could only ever learn about 1/4 of the available Invocations, and all spontaneous casters (save the Spirit Shaman) had to permanently commit to a small pool of the spells on their list. The sublime martial artists of <em>The Book of Nine Swords</em> faced similar restrictions.
</li><li> 3.x had this in spades among players. The best fighter build, for instance, is considered to be one which uses feats to give a ridiculous number of bonuses to a charge, then praying for that one charge to kill the opponent.
</li><li> Although spellcasters aren't generally subject to this as much, since their big advantage tends to be a lot of versatility, there's a feat called Arcane Thesis, which lets you really specialize in a single spell above all others. Paired with a few other abilities, you can pile on the metamagic for an empowered, twin, chain, repeat, maximized, enervating, admixed, searing orb of cold that deals solely fire damage, and enough of it to literally kill gods. But, you won't be able to do much else, and it's considered one of the weaker ways to go. Yes, godslaying is subpar for casters. Go figure.
</li><li> Perhaps the most extreme caster example in 3.5 is the psionic class the Wilder. With an utterly dismal 11 powers known at level 20 (assuming one has not taken feats to gain more, this is one of the lowest of any psionic or arcane caster class in 3.5, period) but the potential to "surge" and vastly increase the wallop of your power when cast, you will be using a very narrow repertoire of powers but surging for immense increases in your effective caster level. This amounts to some truly absurd amounts of damage that can be dished out in a single usage of your power, but you will be using that same power and your wild surge again, and again, and again.
</li><li> The flavour text of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> spell Khelben's Warding Whip (disrupting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeKindOfForceField">magical force constructs</a>) says that Blackstaff once met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Bigby</a> "apparently not on the best of terms" and later expressed his opinion on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingHands">Bigby's Hands</a> line of spells as "the old goat comes up with one good gimmick and beats it to death with a rock".
</li><li> 4e Slayer. What does it do? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Basic attacks.</a> That's all it can do, dishing out huge amounts of damage through basic attacks. And occasionally, have magic items that trigger basic attacks or are triggered by basic attacks. Why does the 4e Warlord like to pair up with Slayer? Because the 4e Warlord focuses on granting other players basic attacks.
</li><li> Warriors who put enough feats into using a specific weapon can result in this, too. In particular, a character focused on ranged attacks can quickly reach the point where a bow is the ideal weapon, regardless of range. Doubly so for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronHeroes">Iron Heroes</a></em> variant's Archer class.
</li><li> 5e Warlocks get a lot of nifty tricks at high level, but for much of their career, in combat, with their limited spell slots, the vast majority of problems end up being solved with two simple words: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">eldritch blast</a>".

Need to develop a new component based on Freakshow and Rikti technology? No, we won't be scavenging their bases; just go and blow them up. In fact, there are many missions that are ostensibly about "investigating" enemy bases; this can reliably be interpreted as "pound every single opponent on the entire map into the ground."

</li><li> Extremely common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> franchise, since that universe operates on a caricature of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>. The best example of this is Adell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories</a></em>, who is presented as a dumb brute who solves everything with his fists... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">except when he effortlessly solves a complex Geo Puzzle in seconds</a>. He then reveals that he is <em>capable</em> of being smart, but that he just happens to live in a world where punching things is the quickest and most efficient solution to your problems.
<ul><li> Disgaea 5 features a lot of this, due to the introduction of "Overloads", powerful super moves possessed by some characters, that become their go-to strategy for basically everything. Seraphina's is seduction, and she's generally unable to deal with anyone who is immune to her charms. Red Magnus can grow large, and the closest thing to tactics he possesses is "grow even larger". Majorita can raise fallen enemies as undead, so her one trick is to avoid you and throw armies of zombies in your way. This is even true in a metagaming sense; there are a couple attacks including the Overload "Comet Disaster" and the Sage's ability "Land Decimator" that attack every enemy on the map, so many endgame strategies simply amount to spamming those attacks with as powerful a unit as possible. It's to the degree where it's considered pointless to teach any unit an Overload other than "Comet Disaster" (or use any generic unit other than the Sage), because no other strategy is as effective.

<ul><li> The New California Republic has gone from a five-city federation to conquering everything from parts of Washington in the north to parts of Baja in the south, and has started to expand eastward into the Mojave Desert. How do they deal with their problems there? They throw people at it. Brotherhood of Steel taking control of the Helios One solar power plant? Throw waves of bodies at it. Caesar's Legion trying to take over Hoover Dam? Throw people at it. As you companion Arcade Gannon states, when the NCR throws enough hands at something "they can make or break anything". Being the sole Old World-styled power this side of the Mississippi, they have the largest industrial base and the farms to support a population of their size, as well as a developed infrastructure and technology that, while not quite on par with the tech-hoarding Brotherhood of Steel, is more than a match for any tribals or raiders that might oppose them.

This let them become a great power in the southwest by overwhelming and conquering their neighboring primitive tribes, but the Legion hit a wall when they encountered the NCR at Hoover Dam and fought an enemy with comparable numbers to their own, as well as decent firearms and combat armor for its basic soldiers. Which put the Legion at a disadvantage, since some of their grunts don't even have guns and are running in with spears or machetes and wearing pre-war football gear as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedArmour">Improvised Armour</a>.

Whistles are also needed for giving the former commands. Something needs to be carried? Use Pikmin. Wall in the way? Pikmin break it down. Need to lower a platform? Throw Pikmin on it until it's weighed down. A giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> humanoid on stone rollers is stalking them and seems to be invincible to all attacks? That's only because in that one cave you don't have access to the <em>Purple</em> Pikmin yet, get them and that blob monster becomes a joke. The Pikmin themselves solve most of <em>their</em> own problems by either hitting it with their leaves/buds/flowers or by carrying something to a destination, that "something" being anything from pellets to ship parts to exploding rocks to enemy corpses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. If you have only one type effective move, screw strategy. Spam Thunder until that Pidgey is on the ground and twitching.
<ul><li> In competitive play a set comprising Rest (restore all health, but fall asleep), Sleep Talk (use a random move in your sleep), Calm Mind/Bulk Up (increase both your offense and defense), and a single attacking move is sometime seen. Even if the opponent resists that attack, after some Calm Minds it won't matter.
</li><li> Also the Choice Items give the Pokémon holding it increased Speed, more powerful physical attacks, or more powerful special attacks, depending on which one you use. However, it forces that Pokémon to keep using the same move you pick first, unless you switch it out and back in, or lose the item somehow.
</li><li> A number of specific Pokémon fit this, either due to a limited move pool or because their stats, type, or some other factor keeps them from using most of the moves they can get effectively. A prime example is Lilligant; if you see one competitively, you can already guess 3/4s of its move set with near certainty: Sleep Powder, Quiver Dance, and Petal Dance. The last move is more of a toss-up, but it tends to be little more than filler anyway, and is usually only used if the "Disable opponent with Sleep Powder, power up with Quiver Dance, kill everything with Petal Dance" plan fails.
</li><li> There are also a handful of Pokémon that have found competitive use simply by using one move over and over due to there being so few Pokémon able to stop them with the right timing:
<ul><li> Slaking was the first one to come up, annihilating anything that isn't Rock-, Steel-, or Ghost-type with Giga Impact. Giga Impact requires the Pokémon be idle on the next turn, which its Ability, Truant, forces it to do anyway. Regardless, any Pokémon with Protect will undo Slaking, so using it well is a matter of figuring out what the opponent has.
</li><li> Serperior was the next one, and the first that made a large effect to competitive play. Serperior can have Contrary, an Ability that changes all stat drops into stat gains and vice versa. It also can use Leaf Storm, a very powerful Grass-type move that would normally drop Special Attack by 2 stages—but with Contrary, it rises by 2 stages instead. This results in an increasingly powerful Leaf Storm that, once enough turns have passed, can wipe out even Pokémon resistant to Grass. It's perfectly valid to bring in a Serperior that knows Leaf Storm and nothing else, because Leaf Storm is all it needed. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em>, the Battle Agency has Serperior as a possible Pokémon available to rent—and it has precisely this scheme, with Leaf Storm as its only move.

This is a move whose power doubles when it goes before its target, which can be done with Choice Scarf, which boosts the user's Speed but locks it into one move.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3y0x3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3y0x3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3y0x3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dynamaxing Dracovish allows it to use other moves for three turns, but after that, it re-locks into that move again.</span> Add the Ability Strong Jaw to that, which boosts biting moves like Fishious Rend by 50%, and the Same Type Attack Bonus, which boosts it by another 50%. It's also a Water-type move, so it's eligible for yet another 50% boost when it's raining. With the boosts counted all together, Fishious Rend can do roughly 5 times as much damage as it would without them. The absurd power of a fully optimized Fishious Rend, and the fact that it's easier than it looks to do it, forced people to use Pokémon immune to Water-type moves solely to counter it.

Likewise, most of the Sith Warrior's abilities boil down to "Stab".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight">Summon Night</a></em> exemplifies this trope.
<ul><li> The hammer is a Craft Knight's first weapon, as well as a tool for producing more weapons.
</li><li> In the very first <em>Swordcraft Story</em> game, Pratty (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Cleru</a>) can't get in the labyrinth without a weapon, but she can't forge a weapon without first collecting the materials from the labyrinth, so what's she going to do? Why, use a hammer as her weapon, of course!
</li><li> Then in the second game, Aera (or Edgar, the Male Character) is given the materials to make a basic dagger... which promptly breaks after the first boss fight. Then she gets another set... which ends up poorly forged and breaks immediately. Cue Hammer Time at the local forest.
</li><li> Also, the hammer is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Emergency Weapon</a> of the game, and is always used whenever the player breaks all of their equipped weapons (or has none equipped to start with).
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">tournament battles</a> in the first <em>Swordcraft Story,</em> each Craft Knight gets to bring a single weapon to battle. If a combatant's weapon breaks, they lose.

It doubles the Attack power of your hammer... And nukes your Jump ability until you take the badge off. Similarly, the Jumpman badge powers up jump attacks but disables hammer attacks.
</li><li> Mario in general is original video game <em>king</em> of this trope, as the <em>Portal</em> developers mentioned in an interview once. To get over obstacles, jump over them. To gather coins and upgrades, jump under a "?" block. To kill baddies, jump on them. To lower the flag at the end of the level, jump into it. Everything else is an optional bonus. He manages to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> with nothing but jumping. That sort of takes him to a whole new level of awesome.
</li><li> Mario in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> can't seem to do <em>anything</em> without the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">FLUDD</a>. Never has spraying water at something been so vitally important.

Including (in the first game) spraying ice, water, and fire, carrying objects, hanging on to things, pulling things, grabbing items from afar, defeating enemies, etc.

You use this for everything from attacking enemies to jumping.
</li><li> Chester from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em> has only one attack: his arrow shot. He hits high, low, and <em>hard</em>. He doesn't even need a special skill or a need to locate an enemy's weakness to be powerful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general, game strategy can be described as "Find creative ways to keep your enemy occupied while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> builds up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Ubercharge</a>."
</li><li> The Engineer is another example. As the Meet the Engineer video says "The answer...use a gun. And if that don't work, use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">more gun</a>." A built up sentry gun, or several built up sentry guns can even defeat an Uber.
</li><li> This trope is one of the reasons Pyro, Heavy and Demoman are considered good beginner class choices. While all three have their higher-tier gameplay skills to learn, a lot of problems can be solved by dousing everyone in fire, throwing a wall of bullets at it or spamming the area with so many grenades that the massed splash damage will do the trick, respectively.
<ul><li> By extension, the Pyro is practically a trope victim. Since all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">(her?, it?)</a> primary weapons deal damage through fire, all but one/two of his secondaries also light things on fire (the exception being the fairly generic shotgun or the Reserve Shooter which scores minicrits against airborne foes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4teeu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4teeu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4teeu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It doesn't help that Pyro can airblast people in the air</span>), and one of the best melee options (the Axetinguisher and it's reskin the Postal Pummeler) relying on the target being on fire, it can be safely assumed that fire will be making your kills. This puts the Pyro in a bad position as the number of ways to counter ongoing burn keep increasing.
</li><li> The Heavy is in a similar boat. Too slow to really benefit from melee weapons and having only a choice between some underwhelming shotguns and a support item lunchbox, a Heavy is going to be solving virtually every conflict by way of minigun. Indeed, this is the Heavy's main balancing factor. The minigun is one of the most destructive elements on the field but any way around it (high mobility scouts, long-range snipers, spies, etc.) and the Heavy is best off getting back-up rather than handling it themselves.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> All characters solve their squabbles with relatively non-lethal combat magic. The first boss is almost never related to the real incident of the game; nonetheless, delivering beat downs to at least three random <em>youkai</em> will always point a heroine in the correct direction of the person responsible. Then you deliver a beat down to <em>that</em> person as well, and come back in a week to deal with their quirky entourage. Getting hit in the face with a bullet is practically a "hello" in Gensokyo.
</li><li> Many characters come with a special gimmick and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian</a> spellcards play on as many non-lethal applications of this power as they can imagine. Other characters, based on folklore and <em>youkai</em>, have theme-tinted techniques. The fandom takes this to extreme limits by developing world-building routines that can be based around thorough mundane application of their power. In an aversion, some residents have rather abstract powers that are hard to understand or have set limitations (e.g., Remilia).
<ul><li> While Yukari has many different problem-solving assets, such as personal power, numerous powerful connections, her vast knowledge and intellect, or her considerable political clout, nine times out of ten she simply delegates tasks to either her Shikigami Ran or her employee, Reimu, on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">being too lazy to handle it herself unless she absolutely has to</a>.

When worried about the safety of the Vytal Festival, he brings a massive fleet to Vale, and after the Fall of Beacon, closes the borders of Atlas and turns it into a police state, with soldiers and robots patrolling the streets. While Ironwood feels the displays of power will comfort the people while intimidating their enemies, these acts only raise tensions, making it perfect for Salem's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">Divide and Conquer</a> methods.

Recognizing a true "overabundance" of bees at a workplace that didn't think through the implications of Bring a Shitton of Bees to Work Day? Add bees. Bee convention that actually wants bees?

<ul><li> Fighter thinks very much this way. He's dumb enough to miss important clues to the workings of the world around him, but he's also exceedingly skilled with his swords (not to mention fixated on them). At a certain point he creates "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantChucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantChucks">swordchucks</a>" (a combination of swords and nunchucks, that allows him to wield four swords simultaneously). His spiritual mentor appears to him in the form of a giant sword wearing glasses. Oh, and when conversations don't involve swords, he completely ignores them.
</li><li> This trope in regards to Fighter is taken to its logical extreme when he faces his own worst vice, the manifestation of Sloth, which accuses him of always falling back on his sword techniques instead of improving himself in new ways, like using his mind. Fighter gets past it by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing it with his swords, saying "my mind told me this would be faster."</span>

He has no head for strategy and hates thinking too hard, but as he once put it "there's a level of force against which no tactics can succeed", and takes extra pleasure in killing wizards who accuse him of being dumb and repetitive. But while he hates battle tactics, he's absolutely brilliant at psychological manipulation. Examples include the rubber bouncy ball <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">engraved with the Symbol of Insanity which causes an entire room of paladins to start killing each other</span> and the brutal "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Butch and Bitch</a>" speech in <em>Start of Darkness</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where he gets Redcloack to kill his own brother so the guilt will tie him to Xykon forever</span>.

In the main comic, he survives weeks of torture, uses the opportunity to talk to a minion and begins to convert him to good, and once he escapes he reveals that he learned most of Xykon's spell list "one saving throw at a time." He claims that surviving is pretty much the only thing he's good at, and if he had another skill that didn't require him getting stabbed, he would gladly use that instead.

<ul><li> The Mane Six tend to try and use the Elements of Harmony for every major threat, often with little success. The protagonists pursue and acquire the ancient, extremely powerful set of magical artifacts known as the Elements of Harmony, which are capable of extreme feats of power. But, because they keep getting stolen, they are given the Elements permanently in Twilight Sparkle's house, which backfires when Twilight accidentally casts a spell on them which switches their lives around. Finally, when big black vines overrun Equestria, they yet again break out the Elements of Harmony to combat the threat, only to discover that they must return the elements to the Tree of Harmony to fix the problem.
</li><li> For pretty much everything else, their scheme tends to be "friendship: apply directly to the problem". Given the title of the show it's not too surprising. Reforming former villains Discord and Starlight Glimmer basically involved "be their friend and they'll pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>" which worked.

Even after pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, she still struggles to learn that not every problem can be solved by casting a spell: "All Bottled Up" had her try and solve of a problem of not using magic by using even more magic and "Every Little Thing She Does" had her decide that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raping</a> them into effectively being her servants was a good plan.

This culminated in disastrous invasions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>.
<ul><li> Napoleon's tactics and battleplans in warfare could all be boiled down to "place a lot of artillery where it will hurt the enemy the most and fire until they break and run". Said approach earned Napoleon many victories when he should have lost (Austerlitz, for example: had he failed to conquer the Pratzen plateau that dominated the battlefield and place his artillery there, the Austro-Russians would have won), but if the artillery was somehow reduced in efficiency he became defeatable (at Leipzig, Napoleon was facing a dozen different corps with independent command from four nations, and by the time one was at the breaking point he couldn't give the <em>coup de grace</em> because of attacks from two others, while at Waterloo, Wellington resisted long enough for the Prussian attack because he had placed his troops behind a hill to neutralize direct artillery fire and mud from a nightly rain had reduced the effectiveness of grenades).
</li><li> Hitler and his generals became so wedded to the blitzkrieg strategy that it precipitated two key defeats. In Stalingrad, an army trained for a fast and overwhelming victory in the open became bogged down in urban warfare it was not meant for. At Kursk, the Germans sought to stake everything on one final blitzkrieg to open the road to Moscow, only to realise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">you can't blitz a prepared defence-in-depth</a>. These two battles so weakened the German army that Russian victory became inevitable.

Once the United States brought its powerful industry to bear and all bets were off, the IJN was still looking for that single decisive battle, with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea">disastrous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf">results<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> In Shaolin Kung Fu, it is often skill and physical capability rather than technique that decides a fight.

</li><li> True of most martial arts masters. Famed Taiji master Yang Lu Chan used to beat everyone with the same move: grasp the bird's tail. As the quote above demonstrates, the masters of any martial art are very aware of this. To provide another example: one of the best American karateka used only three techniques in his fights — jab, cross, and front kick. He was just really good at them.

</li><li> Similarly, almost every task in UNIX shell scripting can be jury-rigged with creative stream redirection and the use of one of three programs: grep (a regular expression, or regexp, text-finding utility), sed (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">a regular expression, or regexp</a>, text replacer utility) and awk (an inline programming language that takes, you guessed it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">a regexp</a>, searches text for matches and then executes a routine for every match). In fact, awk was the basis for what later became Perl.
</li><li> It is slightly sad how far a sports coach can get with a tactical repertoire consisting entirely of "Plan A" and "Plan A with slightly different players".
</li><li> In the 1960s, RCA conceived of a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance_Electronic_Disc">Video Disc<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> home video format instead of what would become the far more common magnetic tape format, because doing so would allow them to re-use their vinyl record pressing machines and other phonograph-related infrastructure. Problems with the finicky technology took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">17 years to work out</a> and user experience issues like constantly flipping discs and changing worn playback needles were ignored. When the Disc format <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">utterly failed</a> against rival tape formats, RCA never recovered and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">ultimately lost its place</a> as the most dominant consumer electronics company in the United States.
</li><li> A sports example: The basketball player Shaquille O'Neal was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">a pretty bad shooter and had a very limited offensive repertoire</a>, yet he is #5 on the all-time NBA scoring chart. O'Neal had three moves - a dunk, a lay-up, and a jump-hook - but combined with his insane physical gifts (7 feet, 330+ pounds and explosiveness) and footwork he really didn't need any more moves.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a>, most pitchers have multiple pitches they can throw so that batters have to guess what they will throw next. Occasionally, though, pitchers get by with only one — and in some cases, thrive. The most famous example is Mariano Rivera. He has only one pitch — a 'cut' fastball, or a fastball that moves away from right handed batters. He has ridden this one pitch to be widely acknowledged as the greatest reliever in major league history.
<ul><li> The reason this typically doesn't work in baseball is because if hitters know what is coming, it is much easier for them to see where the ball is going and know to swing or not and when to swing. In some cases like Rivera's, it doesn't matter because the one pitch is so dominant that even though hitters know it is coming, they can't stop it. Another way to get by this is to throw a knuckleball — a ball with barely any spin on the ball. The lack of spin counter-intuitively causes the ball to have crazy motion, so that no one, even the pitcher, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">knows exactly where it's going</a>. Some pitchers, such as R.A. Dickey and Tim Wakefield, have succeeded by throwing a knuckleball almost exclusively.
</li></ul></li><li> Boxing. It has a grand total of four offensive techniques (Jab, Cross, Hook, and Uppercut), and five defensive techniques (Slip/Turn, which consists of turning the body so they miss; Bob And Weave, which is essentially ducking, Parrying/Blocking, which deflects the blow to the side; Cover-Up, which uses the forearms as a buffer against the body/face; and Clinch, which is basically a grapple). Every style and form is based off of using these nine techniques to devastating effect. On a simpler level, boxing only strikes with the closed fist.
<ul><li> Boxing defense is argued by some to be even simpler than that. Teddy Atlas is fond of saying "There are three ways to defend against a punch. You can block, you can dodge, and you can counter, and too many fighters only learn to do one of those things."
</li><li> If you think about it, boxing offense is also simple, as the aforementioned attacks above are just variations of how you can hit your opponent with your fist. Boxers mostly need to know two things, how hard they should hit the opponent and where they should hit the opponent.
</li></ul></li><li> When the M14 rifle was developed following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a>, the American military decided, to ease up on logistics requirements like what they had to go through during WWII (three or four different ammo types for six or so weapon systems), the M14 would replace every single long gun in the arsenal. Being a full-size battle rifle with heavy recoil and a small magazine capacity, this failed quite hard - it turns out that, rather than becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> as expected, a ten-pound weapon with 20-round magazines is simultaneously too heavy for quick movement and close-range spraying, but <em>also</em> too light for effective sustained fire for suppression at range, with the magazine capacity hindering it in both cases; the weapon only even still sees use in the modern day because, when locked to semi-auto, it makes a pretty good marksman's rifle. Even today, when standard-issue weapons do actually use the same ammo for different purposes, there are still differing weapons for each of those purposes (e.g. if you need suppression fire, you let the belt-fed machine guns that can quickly replace an overheated barrel do it, rather than forcing the role onto assault rifles with magazines of a couple dozen bullets and no facility for replacing the barrel in the field).
<ul><li> This trope is also seen in how various countries have reacted to the rise of cheap and effective body armor. NATO countries have focused on creating a new class of weapons, using smaller bullets with sharper tips fired at higher velocities to stab through armor. Russia simply made overpressure variations of the existing 9x18 and 9x19mm cartridges to hit armored targets harder. Though, it should be said that the Russians also created a new caliber in effect, since the "overpressure 9x18mm" first needed a new bullet design to maximize penetration, and then a longer cartridge case to hold the increased charge, and then a new gun to cope with the overpressure, leading what was originally a mere hot-loaded cartridge to becoming the 9x21mm Russian, and a series of firearms developed to handle it.
</li></ul></li><li> The primary way that Greek generals adapted the phalanx for various tasks was to simply make it denser and thicker. Epaminondas was said to have made a phalanx fifty men deep to fight off the Spartans.
</li><li> Go ahead and ask an electrician how often he uses his screwdriver as a chisel or his linesman pliers as a hammer, and when you're done go ask a plumber how often he uses his wrench as a hammer.
</li><li> Money. If you have enough of it, you can make anything happen (well, anything humanly possible) by paying the right people.
</li><li> Germany was blessed with a lot of coal, contributing to its industry in the Ruhr and a strong railway system, but it has often lacked other resources. Two regimes in German history, the Nazis and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">the GDR</a>, pursued economic self-sufficiency for Germany and were forced to really stretch what could be done with coal.
<ul><li> Hitler's policy of autarky for Germany proved counter-productive, since as long as they refused to export anything they could not earn foreign currency with which to import food, petrol, rubber, and many other products. Fortunately there was a very large and innovative chemicals industry in Germany, and during the 1910s and 20s German scientists had figured out processes for converting bituminous coal into synthetic fuel and a wonderful array of other synthetic products. During World War II, they synthesized coal into aviation gasoline, petrol, rubber, methanol, ammonia, and nitric acid. At Heydebreck they synthesized food oil, and tested it on concentration camp prisoners. Unfortunately for Germany, synthesis was unsustainably expensive compared to normal petroleum extraction, and while their ally Romania produced a lot of oil it wasn't enough. Their attempt in 1941 to conquer the Soviet Union in just three months—in the process capturing all the agricultural land and oil fields needed for self-sufficiency—backfired horribly and turned into a four-year-long, unwinnable struggle. Towards the end, when the oil production facilities of Germany and Romania were being increasingly disabled by the Allies, they resorted to de-motorizing many of their ground units, converting civilian vehicles and training tanks to run on wood gas, and designing an interceptor airplane to be propelled by a ramjet using <em>granulated coal</em> as fuel!
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, when the NATO and Warsaw blocs weren't trading with each other, the Bonn Republic in West Germany had (and still has) notable quantities of black coal within its borders, while the German Democratic Republic in East Germany only had lignite, or brown coal. Lignite is the lowest grade of coal because it is just this side of peat, contains way too much sulfur, and comes out of the ground so wet that half of it is water. It is so dirty, even oil or regular coal is an improvement in terms of the environmental record and it is mostly mined open pit, meaning whole villages had to be moved to access it. On the other hand, there is nothing in organic chemistry that cannot be made from lignite and water. Lignite can also be burned as a fuel. At the end of years of experimentation, chemical engineers had found a way to make <em>margarine</em> from it. That's right, they even tried to feed their citizens something made from lignite. The GDR had a huge chemical industry which - after the USSR cut petroleum supplies - ran almost exclusively on lignite.
</li></ul></li><li> In urban planning this could be renamed to "when all you have is cars, all solutions will look like streets". While there has been a major paradigm shift in Europe and some American cities are also slowly moving away from this philosophy, in many cases this is still the main line of thinking. Congestion? Build more freeways! Downtown business in trouble? Nothing that a bit of freeways won't solve! Your city is losing residents? Well, it's probably because they do not have enough freeways! And if the freeways don't fix it, don't forget to add ample parking.
</li><li> Solving mathematical equations with higher exponents: When all you have is a function for solving a(X^2)+bX+c=0, just change functions until they fit that formula (the cubic and quartic polynomials can be solved this way). Downplayed in that it can't be done with everything, and there are methods to solve things which can't be rewritten into this.
</li><li> This trope is the reason why factoring a base 2 polynomial is taught before the quadratic formula. Had it been the other way, some students may choose to forgo the faster factorization in favor of using the formula every time.
</li><li> Controversially, police in the US are notoriously deadly for this reason. In the heat of the action, using batons, nightsticks, or even just talking down the suspect take a backseat when a gun is right on your belt.
</li><li> Evolution is fond of this, because it's easier to duplicate and adapt one gene to do something else than make an entire new gene specifically tailored for a new purpose. One example of this is that a lot of the genes related to limb formation and growth are also used to produce other, non-limb extremities.
</li><li> Knots: Forget everything your scout leader taught you. The "rope through the loop"-knot, or occasionally multiple, can solve almost every rope-related problems.
