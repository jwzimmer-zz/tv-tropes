<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the titular character has two specific relationships invoking this trope.
<ul><li> The first is with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher">Academy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher">instructor</a>, Iruka Umino, who openly states that Naruto is like a little brother to him and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> to Naruto in the first episode of the series. It's this influence in Naruto's life that has kept him from becoming a psychotic killer  like, for example, Gaara. By the end of the anime series, Iruka is fully acknowledged as Naruto's father figure.
</li><li> The second is Jiraiya, who often treated Naruto like a grandson. This relationship is later confirmed after Jiraiya's death by Iruka, who tells Naruto that Jiraiya was always bragging about him and had mentioned multiple times that he thought of Naruto as a grandson.
<ul><li> Furthermore, it's revealed that Jiraiya was Naruto's godfather and a father figure to Naruto's father, Minato Namikaze. However, a combination of factors (Jiraiya's espionage missions and probably being unprepared for parenthood given he is an eccentric "super-pervert) meant he was largely absent for Naruto's early years, but they quickly bond when they train together.
</li></ul></li><li> Tsunade is third and only mother figure to Naruto, though she didn't care much for him at first, Naruto reminded her of her little brother Nawaki and lover Dan Kato due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a> nature and dream of becoming Hokage. After assisting her and Jiraiya in fighting Orochimaru (where she saved his life) Tsunade gives him the first Hoakage's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">necklace</a> and a kiss on the forehead for good measure. Though she finds his reckless behavior troublesome, saying he has inherited Jiraiya's antics. But when the fourth Raikage doubts Naruto, Tsuande gives him her undying support and how proud she is of him. She also motherly to Sakura and has passed down all her teachings to her
</li><li> Kakashi is of course one as well, but was separated from his sensei's son due to the instance of the Third Hokage (and Kakashi's own truama along with being in the ANBU Black Ops). Upon meeting Naruto when forming Team 7 he grew to like him, but found it easier to train Sasuke. After two arcs Kakashi, no longer held back in acting fatherly towards Naruto, often checking up on him in his apartment and making sure he was eating well. When Naruto learned his wind jutsu, Kakashi tried to give him a hug but Naruto only freaked out over his sensei being so weird. Towards the end of the series Kakashi tells how proud he is of Naruto especially in comparison to Sasuke.
<ul><li> Kakashi is also a father figure for Sakura, especially considering her actual parents never appear outside filler.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>, Tamahome's mentor Tokaki urges him to leave with Miaka and the Suzaku Seishi as the building they're in begins to collapse, all the while telling him to take care and that he cares for his protegee like a son. As in most other cases, Tamahome's father was already dead when Tokaki said this, but what's touching is when Tamahome then calls Tokaki "father".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub">Lone Wolf and Cub</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The very last panel of the series is of a fatally wounded Retsudo Yagyu declaring the recently orphaned Daigoro his "grandson of the heart".</span>
</li><li> Madame Red, Ciel's maternal aunt, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> thinks of him like one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This would save his life and cost Madame Red her life.</span>
</li><li> A rather strange example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat">Skip Beat!</a></em> occurs when the main character, Kyouko, is given an "assignment" to improve her characterization technique by a famous actor that she's been tasked to help during his stay in Japan. She has to act the part of his son for a day or two, and by the end of the exercise they have bonded and he tells Kyoko that she can keep calling him "father."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em> the Magi Scheherazade feels this way towards her subordinate, a young magician named Titus Alexius, who also feels the same way, saying that he considers her his mother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Given that Titus is her clone, one could say that they are indeed parent and child.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Muten Roshi</a> at his best non-perverted moments is like a grandfather to the Turtle Hermit's School, especially to Goku.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> anime, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> between Gohan and Cell, Piccolo says that Gohan is a like a son to him.
</li><li> Future Trunks saw future Gohan in this light due to Vegeta getting killed off in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, Trunks loved Gohan enough that his death at hands of No. 17 and No. 18 is what pushes him into becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> in one of the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> moments in the series. Trunks is amazed to see Gohan alive in the present time, though he says nothing to about his bond with Gohan. Present Gohan is a big brother figure to kid Trunks too.
</li><li> Uub sees Goku in this light in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>; Goku even gives him the Flying Nimbus at the end of manga.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: In the Soul Society arc, Yamamoto tells Ukitake and Kyouraku they are like sons to him just to emphasise exactly why he's he's not simply going to whip their hides for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarsOfMoralCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarsOfMoralCharacter">betraying him</a> but will instead obliterate them off the face of the earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> there are plenty of examples:
<ul><li> Shanks is the big one for Luffy, not only inspiring Luffy to become a pirate but sacrificed his arm to save Luffy from a sea king and gave him his strawhat and told Luffy to give it back to him once he had made as pirate. When asked by Whitebeard how he lost his arm, Shanks said simply he made a bet on the future, this connection caused Luffy's marine grandfather to bear a grudge against Shanks for "filling Luffy's head with poison". During the aftermath of Marineford, Shanks asks his old rival Buggy to give Luffy's hat back to him saying it isn't time to return it yet.
</li><li> Dr. Kureha never tells him directly, but bids Chopper farewell by saying, "Have a safe trip, my stupid son."
<ul><li> In the same vein is Dr. Hililuk, the first human to befriend the misfit reindeer.
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Hililuk</strong>: In a few moments, a monster will arrive here. He's my son. Please, don't hurt him.
</div><ul><li> Whitebeard calls his crewmembers and allies working under him as his sons. They in return also call him "Dad".
</li><li> Former pirate turned chef Zeff was one to Sanji, who taught everything regarding cooking, fighting style and manners. This becomes especially prominent when we meet Sanji's biological family, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a cruel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who turned most of his children into sociopathic living weapons with the exception of Reiju, the only girl, and Sanji was spared due to the rushed actions of their mother. Sanji makes it clear that he does not see Judge Vinsmoke as his father, but "Red-Leg" Zeff.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Master Makarov of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> guild considers all of the guild members to be his children (and one of them is his actual grandson). In one chapter, when Erza Scarlet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is having a near-death experience and seeing the world as if she has died</span>, he specifically mentions loving her like a daughter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> has this between the Elric Brothers and their alchemy teacher in Izumi. Beyond learning alchemy on her, she served as a stern disciplinary figure to them and martial arts teacher. This becomes more poignant when we learn that in the same way the Elric Brothers' hubris in trying to bring back their mother cost them, Izumi made the same mistake trying to resurrect her stillborn child. In a roundabout way, they did get what they wanted in finding each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> gives us a particularly heartbreaking example in the final chapter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Shinohara is left comatose with little hope of recovery, his wife finds Juuzou sitting at his bedside. While talking, she reassures him that her husband loved him like his own child. After she leaves the room, Juuzou promises to work hard for Shinohara's sake and tenderly kisses his forehead, showing that the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> has finally learned how to care about others</span>.
</li><li> Hiroko, Saki's best friend to Kousei, Saki's son, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em>. Even though she doesn't make an appearance until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> in episode 10, she's been established as something like Kousei's second mother and even refers to him as her son.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. Since Fujiwara helps Shirogane with a variety of subjects such as sports, music, cooking and even folding balloons, she's called him her son when emotional; her stupid, hopelessly annoying son who can't do anything right, destroying her image of him. But despite even gaining a trauma when it comes to helping him, she just can't help but teach him when he's failing, even once getting jealous when Kaguya started teaching him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> I raised that boy.
</div></li><li> In the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, during the anime-only Virtual Nightmare Arc, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">Virtual Ghost</a> of Seto Kaiba's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive adoptive father Gozaburo</a> angrily tells Kaiba he treated him better than his own son.

<ul><li> Alfred may officially be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne's</a> butler, but he was always more of a surrogate father to him after Thomas and Martha's untimely deaths (at least in Post-Crisis.)

My son has died."
<ul><li> It's similarly inverted: in the same series, Alfred finds a video will that Bruce made for him. In it, Bruce remarks that Alfred isn't <em>like</em> a father to him—he <em>is</em> his father.
</li><li> Bruce himself treats the Robins as his sons, most notably in Dick Grayson though it extends ove to Jason Todd and Tim Drake. He adopts Cassandra Cain as his daughter and he does come around to view Stephanie as sorta one. Meanwhile, Damien is his actual blood son, but things are a bit complicated due to him being raised by his mother Talia for the first decade or so of his life without his awareness.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">Barry Allen</a> considers Kid Flash and later the third Flash Wally West as his own son. The two are quite open about this, with Barry referring to Wally as his son frequently, to the point that his own kids were somewhat jealous of Wally. Barry even gave Wally his father's family watch as a high school graduation present to signify this. It became a key point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>, where thanks to their strong bond bypassing even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">reality altering powers</a>, Barry was able to bring Wally back into world from Speed Force.
<ul><li> The Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, had something like this for the rest of the Flash Family, particularly during Wally's era. He at one point formally adopted Bart Allen, has told Jesse Quick multiple times she's like a daughter to him (and she's remarked on how much of a second father he is to her), and Wally he regularly treated like his son. He was more like a much older brother figure to Barry however, as the two weren't nearly as close so he had less time to spend with them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ancient One refers to his disciple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> as "the one I am pleased to call son" or simply "my son."

<ul><li> In the Ultimate Six comic mini-series, the group (only five at the moment) break out of a SHIELD prison and Osborn says they need to look for 'his boy.' When Otto Octavius asks where Harry is being kept, Osborn's response is: "What are you talking about? My boy's name is Peter."

</li><li> Perry White on a few occasions has stated Lois Lane was like a daughter to him. He even sat along side her parents at Lois and Clark's wedding.

<ul><li> In the "NYPD Blue" parody, one character says that his boss was like a father to him, but it's pointed out that the speaker was abused as a child.

After daily jokes (such as the chick refusing to eat Italian food, and Garfield saying "NO SON OF MINE WOULD REFUSE LASAGNA!"), the fat cat sends the little bird away. The chick sadly says "Goodbye, Daddy"...and Garfield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">sheds a tear</a>.
<ul><li> It's heavily implied that Jon loves Garfield and Odie as if they were his children (especially considering he doesn't have any of his own). In a lengthy arc, he's so distraught at the thought of losing them that he travels to a pet shop to try to adopt new animals.
</li><li> Similarly, Garfield tends to treat Pooky, his teddy bear, as his baby. In early strips, he would panic whenever Pooky was "hurt" (an arm falling off, being unstuffed, etc.) and demand that Jon fix him right away.

<div class="indent"><strong>Giles:</strong> Spike's like a son to me.
</div><ul><li> To clarify, that was a zany dream. Spike is not like a son to Giles. Xander, however, is, and Willow and Buffy are like daughters.
<ul><li> When everyone lost their memories in <em>Tabula Rasa</em> and started trying to reconstruct their relationships, Spike decided he was Giles' son while Giles seemed to think Spike must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">his younger brother</a>. It's only because they both speak with English accents, Giles looks a bit older (Spike is actually a century older than him!) and they feel an instinctive resentment toward each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Dickish Head of the Watchers Council Quentin Travers is the first person to say what Giles has been too shy to tell Buffy himself: "[Giles has] a father's love for the child". Quentin means it in a dismissive way, but it clearly means the world to Buffy to hear this when she's been dropping hints to Giles about wanting him to hang out with her socially now that she's realizing her real dad is no longer making an effort to see her, even on her birthday. Throughout the series Buffy is more comfortable with telling Giles how she feels ("Giles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove">I love you</a>]]", "I want you to give me away [at her spell-induced wedding...but the sentiment about Giles is genuine]") while Giles - in his British repressed way - is more likely to take a roundabout way ("You're everything a Watcher-everything <em>I</em> could have hoped for", "Wish I could play the father/And take you by the hand") or express his love through gestures like helping out when her mother gets sick, paying her bills, verbally and physically defending her from men she can't slay, culminating in his attempt to help her fly out of the nest by going back to England. It kind of works and it kind of doesn't, and they both have regrets about it, but reunite as a team and a family in time for the series finale.

Fran is calling Maggie, Brighton, and Grace "her kids" by the fifth episode, and her love for them is clearly more maternal than professional.
<ul><li> It's later inverted with Mr. Sheffield and Sylvia, Fran's mother, later in the series, after Fran has finally married Maxwell. When Fran is briefly hospitalized, Max and Sylvia rush to the hospital together, and he does his best to calm her down, calling her "Mom." Sylvia notes that he's never done that before, and he explains that she's been a better, dearer mother to him than his birth mother ever was. It's especially surprising because Sylvia's behavior borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">invasive and annoying</a> at times, particularly when she shows up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eat the Sheffields out of house and home</a>.

She's not just some cheap floozy—she's like my own daughter!"
<ul><li> Marie and Debra largely avert this trope, especially because the former is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">extremely doting and controlling toward Ray</a>. However, it's occasionally hinted that Marie sees Debra fondly; for instance, she's arranged to leave all of her recipes to Debra in her will.

McGuirk even becomes noticeably jealous of Brendon's relationship with his <em>actual</em> father for much of season two.

Even more of a subversion when Danny destroys his chances of creating a Danny clone and continually fights him. It gets to a point in the show when he stops pursuing him and wants to make his life miserable and maybe kill him. He also tried to take Danny's sister Jazz in at one point. That didn't work out too well, either.

After the war, he claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> said to him "If I had a son, I wish he'd resemble you" during one of their conversations. The veracity of this is still debated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> tended to see his brothers (even his elder brother Joseph, at times) and younger friends like Marmont or Junot in this way. He took care of their advancement (sometimes against their will) and their marriages (again, sometimes against their will), expecting that they would repay him at least with gratitude. Not all of them did.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, who had no biological children of his own, had this relationship with two of his young aides-de-camp during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>:
<ul><li> He had an especially strong relationship with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarquisDeLaFayette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarquisDeLaFayette">Marquis de La Fayette</a>. When Lafayette was wounded during the Battle of Brandywine River, attempting to rally the troops, Washington told the surgeons to treat him "as if he were my own son." Lafayette would later name <em>his</em> son Georges Washington de La Fayette.
</li><li> Washington was also noted to have a quasi-paternal relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, although never as strongly as with Lafayette. Washington served more as a kind but stern father figure to the (orphan) Hamilton, which Hamilton probably saw in more parental terms than Washington did. That said, it's telling that when Washington became President, Hamilton was his most trusted advisor and the closest thing he had to a confidant.
