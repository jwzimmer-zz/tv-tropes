<ul><li> The meta mistake for most items below that aren't just wrong/dangerous can be thought of as Last Resort First. There are <em>some</em> circumstances where trained people will use them, but there are supposed to be a lot of less flashy, less risky things to go through first. Desperate life-saving measures are, well, desperate and offset against loss of life. Of course, in fiction-land, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a> is king...
</li><li> Moving injured people in any situation is often handled badly. An injured person should only be moved if the immediate danger can't be moved <em>away</em>. Otherwise, the character should wait for professional assistance, and can double their usefulness by keeping the person from trying to move themselves, holding their heads steady (to minimize the risk of exacerbating a cervical spine injury if there's evidence they may have fractured it) if possible.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry">Over-the-Shoulder Carry</a>, traditional Fireman's Carry, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry">Bridal Carry</a> are all <em>absolutely awful, last-ditch only</em> ways to carry an injured person away from danger, regardless of the injury. They increase the risk of spinal injury, or exacerbating injuries like gunshot wounds and stabs.
</li><li> Car wrecks are one of the most common mechanisms of injury resulting in spinal compromise (see above). Pulling someone out of a wreck without precautions is an "emergent move" only justified when there is a serious life threat present. Thus, unless you actually see or hear gasoline leaking + smoke, or one or both cars is <em>actually</em> on fire, <em>leave people in the cars</em> until qualified firefighters and paramedics arrive. Dragging a downed motorcyclist or cyclist is even worse, unless he or she is in immediate danger.
</li><li> Similarly, as noted in the examples, pulling/carrying a collapsed performer off a stage, <em>especially</em> when the cause of the collapse is unknown and/or there's a high possibility of neck/spinal cord injury (e.g. falls, someone who was headbanging/windmilling/doing headstands/otherwise moving their head and neck around intensely immediately before the collapse and/or showing pain in the neck/back/shoulders before it, someone who got hit in the head or neck or back with something). Instead, halt the show, remove stuff around them that could hurt them, and <em>wait for proper medical assistance to arrive.</em>
</li><li> Childbirth is rarely a medical emergency and almost never occurs in a few <em>hours</em> in first-time mothers, let alone within minutes in the back seat of the car on the way to the hospital. Odds are very good that Mom and Baby will be fine without radical action, even if Baby actually comes out in your avalanche cut-off cabin. Those doctors who aren't around (and that you could probably <em>walk</em> to if in a city) mostly catch Baby and hand her to Mom with the cord still attached. All of that means you should not resort to said radical, otherwise dangerous action to get medical care i.e. drive recklessly.
</li><li> Treating burns with butter or oil. Butter or oil will <em>worsen</em> any burn from sunburn to third-degree burns, and possibly get it infected. If the skin is recently burned/still burning and the burn is 1st or 2nd degree (most sunburns, brief contact with a hot object, dropped cigarette or cigar on leg, etc), immerse it in or spray it with cool water to stop ongoing damage. If it's third degree, then try to keep it cool and clean, but call 911 (112 in the European Union as well as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_%28emergency_telephone_number%29#Implementation">other countries<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and wait for the professionals to arrive rather than using cold running water.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison">Suck Out the Poison</a>: Orally sucking out snake venom was and still is common practice in various societies, but most venomous snake bites aren't going to kill a healthy person so its seeming effectiveness is illusory. As soon as the venom hit the bloodstream most of it probably got carried away from the wound. For the sucker there's the obvious risk of bloodborn pathogens in addition to any lingering venom (especially if the sucker has even a tiny cut or sore in their mouth). Mouths, saliva, and fingers all contain tons of microbes that risk infecting the wound (ditto for anything used to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutOutThePoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutOutThePoison">Cut Out The Poison</a>, another bad idea). On top of all that, venomous snakes don't always inject venom when they bite. Best treatment is to keep the person calm and still (so the venom doesn't disperse throughout the body as quickly on an elevated heartrate), and lie down with the wound below the heart if possible while waiting for emergency help.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LodgedBladeRecycling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LodgedBladeRecycling">Removing impaling foreign objects from wounds</a>. Generally they've smashed all the bits they're going to smash, and are now acting as a plug on the wound  and an infection can be fought off with antibiotics at the hospital. Pull the plug, and you may be dead in minutes. Barbed weapons might tear more flesh, and if they don't, you're unlikely to be able to pull it out at the exact angle it went in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut">We Have to Get the Bullet Out</a>. A bullet can remain undetected inside somebody for years and not cause any problems. Generally, the only times a bullet needs to be removed is if it is still traveling in the body, becoming dislodged can lead to a fatal injury (in which case the doctors want to remove it in a controlled environment rather than it becoming dislodged on its own at random), or if it is serving as a source of infection or immune reaction (far more likely due to the wound itself, not the bullet on account of the high heat levels involved in firing). Getting the bullet out is usually the <em>last</em> thing surgeons bother to do. Funnily, much of the reason it's such a common assumption is that for a long time, having to remove projectiles from wounds was indeed a pretty good thing for any medic to do. Musket balls are larger and slower than bullets, meaning they were more problematic to leave in the wound and had a habit of taking bits of clothing with them, and arrowheads are even larger and slower than that (ironic, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">their own associated trope</a>). This meant leaving them in was a good way to get an infected wound.
</li><li> Trying to make someone vomit poisonous or infectious things they have consumed. If they aren't already vomiting (which <em>does</em> happen with some substances, alcohol being the most notorious), you should just get them to a hospital. Supportive treatment begun early (or antidotes/antitoxins where they exist) often does far more good than trying to purge the substance from the body. Finally, in some cases a drug, alcohol, or other overdose can cause unconsciousness and someone vomiting can breathe in their own vomit (pulmonary aspiration), complicating their potential survival with a nasty case of pneumonia or asphyxiation. If the poison was a strong acid, alkali, or a petroleum product, vomiting could cause further damage to the esophagus and mouth. It is important to note that many countries offer a poison control hotline,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09y3k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09y3k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09y3k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">1-800-222-1222 in the United States</span> which can offer expert advice and specific instructions for the particular poison ingested (if known). If these guys say to induce vomiting, do it; however, as noted before, this is a situational precaution, and should not be attempted unless it is known for certain it is the right thing to do.
</li><li> Administering a laxative, suppository, or enema to someone who has stomach/intestinal pain of unknown cause. If they have appendicitis, this can rupture their appendix, leading to at least a horrific infection and possibly their death. If they have any immobile blockage (say, a tumor or an object), their entire large intestine can rupture, leading to almost certain death. Laxatives, suppositories, and enemas should only be administered if the primary illness is constipation with no lower abdominal pain worse than mild discomfort that has persisted no longer than a week, and when the obstruction is known to consist only of fecal matter. Otherwise, the proper course of action is to get them to a hospital, where proper imaging and tests can be done to determine the cause of the pain, and there's surgeons and antibiotics available for any sudden problems.
</li><li> Administering lots of acetaminophen/paracetamol/Tylenol/Panadol for pain or fever or similar. Acetaminophen/paracetamol has a surprisingly low dose before it can cause liver damage (especially in heavy drinkers, steroid users, hepatitis A, B, or C patients, or others who may have compromised liver function). If the recommended dose of acetaminophen doesn't help, give up on it and use alternative analgesics. And if someone drinks a lot or has hepatitis, don't <em>ever</em> give them acetaminophen in the first place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable">CPR</a> alone has so many, it has its own page.
</li><li> Disregarding the security of an accident scene or even personal safety, in violation of the most important rule: Avoid increasing the number of casualties. Rushing onto the freeway isn't any more safe because there's an upended car on it. This one's popular in real life  paramedics get called out at least weekly in some areas for accidents caused by people running onto the freeway to help. It may seem cold, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em> outcomes aren't the goal, especially when there are many Private Ryans.
</li><li> Approaching a person in obvious mental distress in a threatening and dominating way or suddenly trying to grab them. This one is often done in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> by police, and often leads to the person acting out, escalating the problem. If someone is in obvious mental distress (appears to be attempting suicide, appears to be hallucinating or tripping, uncontrollable crying or rage), the proper response, if no one else is at risk, is to back off and allow the person space, and to approach, if at all, slowly, calmly, and ideally with permission. Someone in mental distress, for whatever reason, often will respond to compassion and respect much better than they will to orders, threats, or being touched (i.e. in their mind, suddenly physically assaulted).
</li><li> Aquatic problems can be even worse. Basic aquatic safety and lifesaving courses will tell you to stay the hell out of the way if there are any professional lifeguards around, and anybody without at least basic training is far more likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">to make the situation much, much worse</a> than better when they get grabbed by the original victim.
</li><li> In Hollywood, if CPR is ineffective, it is perfectly fine to start striking random hammerfists to the center of the patient's chest in an attempt to restart their heart. In real life, this is called a precordial thump, and is not a free beating, but a <em>precisely aimed</em> blow delivered by an <em>expert</em> in an attempt to interrupt a life-threatening rhythm, in the event that a defibrillator is not available, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">can only be attempted once</a>.
</li><li> The Miraculous Bitchslap Of Life. Somebody isn't breathing, or there's no pulse, and their buddy gets all emotional and angry and slaps them a couple of times, perhaps accompanied by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe">How Dare You Die on Me!</a> speech. After a few seconds, they come around. Needless to say, if someone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> is badly-injured enough to fall unconscious, slapping them is <em>far</em> more likely to make the injuries worse than to rouse the subject from their stupor.
</li><li> Putting someone's head back when they have a nosebleed  you risk making them choke or puke from swallowing the blood. You're supposed to pinch the bridge of the nose and lean forward until the bleeding stops.
</li><li> Person has hypothermia? Throw them in hot water! In real life, this would cause their core temperature to shoot up way too quickly, inviting the colder fluid from the extremities in while simultaneously risking burning them. The resulting diffusion would make the person even colder overall, or mess up their heart, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">even worse,</a> the sudden return of circulation to cold extremities might result in a fatal drop in blood pressure.
<ul><li> On top of all that, if there is a solid chance of re-freezing (ex. low supplies, wanting to continue hiking), thawing the tissues just to have them freeze over again could cause more damage than leaving it as-is until steady warmth is available. I.e. what happens to meat that's frozen, thawed, then frozen, then thawed again in your freezer, except still connected to something living.
</li></ul></li><li> Giving alcohol to someone stranded in cold weather or especially suffering from hypothermia, with special mention to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintBernardRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintBernardRescue">it often shown as being delivered by St. Bernards</a>. Alcohol only gives the <em>illusion</em> of warmth when you're freezing: it dilates blood vessels, bringing more of that core warmth to the surface-i.e. just the place for the cold to suck it away all the quicker. It might make you <em>think</em> you feel better, but it's actually killing you faster if you're not actually warm at the time.
</li><li> Beginning care on an adult who has capacity without consent.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g3nd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1g3nd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g3nd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Capacity is defined as the ability to make one's own decisions rationally. Competence is a legal term meaning that a court has deemed a person unable to make their own decisions. However, capacity can be determined clinically; you don't need a court order for every emergency patient who's too drunk, high, or in such mental distress that they're a danger to self and others.</span> The person can sue for assault and battery, and this applies even to choking victims.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rcch');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rcch" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rcch');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Just so this article doesn't stop you from helping people in real emergencies, if consent is given, or if consent can be reasonably assumed (Someone screaming "Please help me" is enough to give a reasonable assumption that they want your help), then you're protected by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law">Good Samaritan Laws<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even if you fail to save the person.</span> Note that this only applies to conscious adults  conscious children are either assumed to give consent, or you must obtain consent from the child's legal guardian (parent or otherwise) on the scene, and if there is no one else on the scene, it's assumed. Unconscious <em>anything</em> is also fair game under the doctrine of implied consent, which is the assumption that an unconscious person would want you to help them even if they can't communicate it. The exception to implied consent is the DNR or Do Not Resuscitate order, in which a patient puts in writing that they do not want help if they fall unconscious, but this is unlikely to apply outside of a hospital or dedicated care facility.
</li><li> An untrained person using a shirt or other article of clothing as a makeshift tourniquet to stop bleeding from a gunshot wound. While this allows for some fanservice as the character tears away their clothing, it's a very <em>bad</em> idea. Like moving an injured person yourself this is cutting straight to one of the most extreme options that are supposed to be offset against "death." The US Army, who have been using makeshift tourniquets out of cravats and windlasses (basically bandannas and sticks) for decades, have shown that advances in combat medicine allow a limb to have a tourniquet applied and blood flow completely cut off for up to 2 hours without permanent damage and up to 4 hours while still keeping the limb. This has gained modern tourniquets such as the CAT (Combat Application Tourniquet) a place in the gear of most modern combat soldiers, and indeed, is the US Military's preferred method of treatment for significant extremity hemorrhage and/or total limb amputation. The current consensus is that when used properly tourniquets work, but should only be used under specific circumstances by <em>professionals</em> unless the situation is that dire. "Dire" in this case meaning that the person is almost certain to die from blood loss before <em>any</em> professional medical aid arrives on site, typically meaning a limb being fully severed.
</li><li> Treating epileptic seizures by putting things in the victims' mouths to prevent them biting or choking on their tongues. Some objects can cause the victim to break their jaw from biting on it. You can also get your fingers bitten from trying to reach into a epileptic's mouth during a seizure.
</li><li> Using a defibrillator to shock someone in asystole (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flatline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flatline">flatline</a>). Prevalent enough to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator">its own trope</a>, but basically if you do this all you're doing is cooking the heart muscle and making it even less likely the person will recover. Most automatic defibrillators made today will flat out <em>not</em> deliver a shock to a flatline because it has no rhythm to work with. The actual process of making a heart beat again after it's gone into asystole involves injecting hormones like vasopressin, atropine and/or adrenaline and is both considerably less dramatic and less likely to succeed, and even if they regain a normal heartbeat they may not live long enough to even be discharged.
</li><li> Believing that the "normal" body temperature is always exactly 98.6°F (37°C) and that illness always produces an elevated temperature. In real life, body temperature fluctuates throughout the day, and the typical range varies from person to person. Someone with a normal temperature can still be sick, and someone running as high as 100°F (37.7°C) might not be.
</li><li> (Repeatedly) taking a dressing off a bleeding wound and applying a new one. By doing this, you're not giving the blood enough time to clot, and you may be removing any clots that may have formed. The correct course of action is to add new bandaging over that which is already soaked through as needed, and even if you wind up with a huge wad of bandaging that's unruly that's still better than disrupting the clotting process.
</li><li> Instantly closing a wound (which may or may not have been created in surgery). While most wounds get cleaned and immediately shut, deep wounds, especially infected ones, often stay open. Treatment of big abscesses or infected wounds often involves opening it, cleaning it and then leaving it open for a few days (with a bandage <em>in</em> the wound to keep it open and a plaster over it to keep it clean and avoid fluids slipping out). This allows the tissue to heal from bottom up and the doctors to check on the infection and keep it clean. Instantly sewing it shut would close the hole, inviting bacteria to create a new <em>or even worse</em> infection which could lead to a lethal blood poisoning (it usually leads to a sepsis  multiple organ failure).
</li><li> Wounds and Water. There could be a page dedicated simply to the assumption in fictional media that a wound should not get in contact with water unless it's a burn. Everyone who has surgery will usually find that swimming pools and sauna are forbidden, but showering is fine as long as the wound itself is not covered in soap (having it run over the wound is OK, though). In some cases, the patient is even encouraged to wash the wound, such as when there is the risk of infection. Certain abscess cases even involve the patient holding the shower head straight at the wound and using the water pressure to clean the wound thoroughly. Note, however, that getting the <em>dressing</em> wet is a different matter; a normal adhesive dressing pad will stand up to the shower but shouldn't be fully immersed in water, and stuff like compression bandages must be kept dry at all times.
</li><li> Assuming a victim is fine because there is nothing currently flowing out of them, stuck in them, latched onto them, etc. Anyone trained in first aid can tell you that shock (the body failing to circulate blood properly) is actually one of the more dangerous threats posed to almost any accident victim. Many cases of shock can stem from what amounts to the body creating errors while responding to stressful stimuli, which means that even a comparatively minor wound (such as a cut on the thumb) can throw a person into shock. Symptoms can be anything from anxiety and confusion to irregular pulse and blackouts, and it's not unheard of for a patient who at first glance does not appear to have any life-threatening injuries to die from shock simply because the body unintentionally shut itself down. One of the best ways to prevent shock is to simply interact with the patient in a reassuring and calm tone, as well as keeping them warm and ensuring proper blood flow to the head and vital organs (usually achieved by propping up the legs).
</li><li> Performing surgery without any form of protective garments. While it's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">Beast Men</a> who are the main problem with this, even without the massive amount of hair that could fall into the person's body during surgery, the average person carries millions of bacteria on the skin of their arms alone, and could lead to infection of the patient without said protective gear. That's why doctors wear gloves even it's something as simple as giving blood, and why doctors are shown washing their hands before surgery: it's there to protect the patient as much as it is to protect the doctors.
</li><li> Giving <em>anything</em> by mouth to someone who is unconscious or barely conscious. If you do, they're likely to choke. IVs exist for a <em>reason</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealItWithFire">Cauterizing wounds.</a> To be more specific, it can be a solution if the person is bleeding badly, and better care is on the way. Otherwise, you're basically going to be giving yourself gangrene and <em>increasing</em> the chance of infection. This applies even more with the things people often use to cauterize themselves (like torches), rather than the electrocauterization favored in the few cases where the situation actually calls for it.
</li><li> Slapping the back of a choking person while they are upright; gravity may cause the object to slip further down the windpipe.
</li><li> Pouring water on yourself to protect from fire or high temperatures. This sounds intuitive, as water can take heat away from the body, but not when you're continuously exposed to hot air. Wet clothes absorb heat more easily than dry ones, which increases the chance that you'll suffer burns and even scalding as the water turns to steam. The only wet thing you'll really want to use is a damp cloth to press over your mouth and nose to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em>, whenever someone has nearly drowned, the usual method of revival is to pull their arms (or front paws, in case of Rantanplan) back and forth, thus pumping the water out of the body. The same technique has been used in older cartoons, since Silvester Method of artificial respiration and dates back to the 19th Century (or early 20th, at least). There's also the Holger-Neilson method, which was used prior to the innovation of modern CPR in 1960. Both have since been shown to be highly dangerous.

So in both cases the method used in the film is not the one being recommended at the time, but an older treatment.</span>

<ul><li> You can increase your health (even above 100%!) with alcoholic drinks and painkillers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall">Deus Ex: The Fall</a>.</em> <em>This still works, <strong>with no ill-effects</strong>, if you take them at the same time.</em>
<ul><li> You're also a <em>heavily</em> augmented human being with an optional extra that actively affects pheromone production/emissions. Suffice to say you're probably not metabolizing those substances in a normal way.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a>: Chaos Theory</em>, the antagonist commits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">Seppuku</a>, and you need him alive. Solution? Oh, just rip that knife right out of him. Worse, Lambert will explicitly call this "stabilizing" him. Just for good measure, shoot the windows out of the <em>underwater base</em> (did we mention you're in an underwater base?) so you can carry him while swimming. Also, in this life-or-death situation where seconds count, Sam takes the time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">respectfully set the knife down</a>.
<ul><li> In the same game, players can heal damage by using a first aid cabinet. While this seems fine at first glance, it soon becomes apparent he just grabs the first bottle in reach from a cabinet he doesn't own, and then takes a large swig without reading it. If this wasn't bad enough, multiple uses mean he grabs different bottles each time, <em>meaning he could be swallowing pretty much anything.</em>
</li><li> The original game seems to poke fun at this, however, where an NPC in the Kalinatek mission requests you carry him to the medical office to treat gunshot wounds. Fisher promptly carries him there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry">across his shoulders</a> like he would for any other unconscious or dead guard he's stuffing in the shadows to avoid alerts - and said NPC exposits for maybe a minute more before bleeding out and dying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> requires the player to perform quick "medical care" in the field when injured if his or her health drops to one bar. This generally involves resetting broken bones with your bare hands (which promptly begin working immediately), pulling pieces of shrapnel and stray branches from your gut (which doesn't cause the wound to start spurting blood all over the place), and removing bullets with (dirty) pliers, all without even bandaging the wound up and immediately getting back into the fight. If your health is at least two bars, healing involves simply injecting yourself with a shot of morphine. If a buddy is critically injured, you can heal them simply by injecting them as well. Otherwise, the only options are comforting them in their passing or blowing their brains out to hasten it.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">The sequel</a> tones it down and adds a little realism to it.<em><strong><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8er4w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8er4w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8er4w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The term "little" is the key word here.</span></strong></em> Makeshift surgery is reserved to when you have no medication or other healing items, removing foreign objects has Jason immediately bandage the wounds to try and reduce bleeding, and the act only heals a little. It should be noted, however, that Jason still does downright stupid things that include <em>removing a bullet with a dirty stick or his teeth.</em> And, as an extra aside, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">RPG Elements</a> in the game allow you to upgrade how effective makeshift surgery is, meaning Jason at the end of the game can potentially remove a bullet with a dirty stick or set a broken thumb to <em>completely</em> recover from all the damage he's recently taken. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em> reuses these animations so Ajay is just as adept at full-body healing by treating his arm.
</li><li> This is parodied mercilessly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a></em> — your first aid animations consist exclusively of ridiculous things, like fixing your cybernetic arm with a welding torch he pulls out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace">nowhere</a> and flexing a grip strength bar to generate electricity.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note91e8j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note91e8j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note91e8j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The protagonist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">cyborg</a> so the part about repairing an arm or generating electricity <em>might</em> make some sense, but how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Rex 'Power' Colt</a> is able to rebuild his normal organs is anybody's guess.</span>
</li><li> And vaguely justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCryPrimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCryPrimal">Far Cry Primal</a></em>; it's the Stone Age, after all, so medicine as a concept doesn't really exist yet. Resetting broken bones, removing arrows and other foreign objects and eating a big chunk of meat (the game's replacement for syringes) is about all that could reasonably be done. Interestingly, some of the animations involve the protagonist covering smaller wounds with a type of brown paste.
</li><li> Played With in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5">Far Cry 5</a></em>. The game lacks any healing animations such as removing bullets and resetting bones. Instead, the deputy actually bandages themselves up with a collectible medkit. It makes sense, given that unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">protagonists</a> of previous games, the deputy would have some kind of first aid training. However, if you or any allies fall into critical condition, all you have to do is pick them up from the ground to completely heal them. And yes, any companion can revive you. This includes the animal Fangs for Hire which revive you from critical injuries by licking your face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>, similar to the RE2 example, you heal yourself or others by wrapping bandages on your/their clothing, and always in the same spots, too. Or, if you're in a hurry, by swallowing an <em>entire bottle</em> of painkillers, enough to <em>kill</em> an average person.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10jf21');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10jf21" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10jf21');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In some fairness, the bottles rattle about enough when equipped that there can't be very many pills left, also explaining why they're single-use like the medkits - but it's still far more than the one or two pills an actual safe dosage would ask for.</span> Lampshaded in the sequel, as the survivors will tell each other as they're doing it that they don't know exactly what they're doing. It still works, somehow.
<ul><li> The sequel also has adrenaline shots which the survivors will jam into their thighs pretty hard and not even bothering to check where on the leg they are injecting the stuff, and you can use it several times without any drawbacks. Adrenaline is mainly used for people with an allergic reaction or suffering from a heart attack to help stabilize the body.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">a programming oversight with the survivor AI</a>, they will often try and heal players at the most inconvenient times, such as when they're trying to move somewhere safe, or in rare cases in the middle of combat - getting stuck right in the middle of Spitter goo and having your feet melted off because Coach decided the cry of said Spitter was the call to heal you is infamously a more common occurrence than it should be. The only way to get them to stop is to stop what you're doing and pull out your own first aid kit or pills, which you may not have. On the higher difficulties, this distraction can be lethal.

In this case it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">Rule of Perception</a>, since if she takes the uniform off, applies the bandage, and then puts the uniform back on, all off screen, the bandage won't be visible, leaving the audience to wonder if she <em>did</em> anything. This is corrected in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2Remake">2019 Remake</a>, where Ada dresses Leon's wound by removing his entire left sleeve before wrapping his injury.

She then proceeds to pull it out, and said wound getting aggravated or worse impedes her progress more than once over the course of the game.
<ul><li> Roth also gives Lara CPR at one point, and while it looks better than some examples, he administers it right next to a burning plane that explodes <em>right</em> after he is done, which violates the <em>first</em> rule of emergency medicine which is to ensure scene safety.

<ul><li> You can also administer treatments that are a bit different, not so much as <em>evil</em> as <em>ineffective</em>. For example, giving olive oil to someone with a cold (which likely won't do much), or giving them vinegar (not exactly what they need; but it <em>might</em> kill bacteria in the throat) or putting alcohol on a sprain (probably not going to relieve pain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink">unless it's the drinking kind of alcohol, and you put it in their mouth</a>).

<ul><li> The Doktor is more or less this trope incarnate.

Also: "Don't worry, ribs grow back! <em>[whispers to his bird]</em> No they don't." All of this is done without gloves. Gloves he later puts on to kill people with.

<ul><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum">Avernum</a></em> games, which ran on the same engine, had the same rule. Since for some reason, the First Aid skill could only be used once per day, and players typically didn't bother to put points in it, this generally meant you were better off just using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">White Magic</a> to heal yourself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a>: Vegas</em> and <em>Vegas 2</em> you heal your injured teammates by jamming a needle into them. Anywhere on their body. Your ally could have been filled with lead and all that's required to get them back in the fight is a needle stab to the face, groin, or foot coupled with a quick, motivational "You're good to go." To top it off, the needle is removed in a manner that's very likely to snap the end off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> makes the curious mistake of having the <em>computer-generated NPCs</em> do CPR wrong. The usual justification for the sort of "bent elbows" CPR (see <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZguxm-Sqtc#t=7m20s">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) common in media mentioned in the opening of this article doesn't really apply. In this case it seems to be a case of art imitating art, even after the reason has disappeared. Another theory is that in the age of motion capture work being used to give the most natural realistic looking movements in games, the team used to play the NPCs couldn't do straight arms without hurting the actor playing the injured person, so it's been grandfathered in even though actual actors are no longer used.
</li><li> Averted in later versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericasArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericasArmy">America's Army</a></em>. You are given an "Individual First Aid Kit" but are made to sit through a lesson which teaches you what treatment to use for each symptom before you're allowed to use it. All are correct battlefield first aid techniques taught by the Army to average soldiers, although the lesson is condensed. However, during a firefight, when a team member goes down, it's often fairly hard to pay attention too long to the symptoms with bullets whizzing by—though one could say that that's the point. Gameplay wise, this just amounts to running up to an injured ally and holding the 'Use' button to patch them up, and ironically, there have been reports of people using what they learned in the game to save lives in the real world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobinsonsRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobinsonsRequiem">Robinson's Requiem</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuIgzFW7B2I">To wit.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> The sequel somewhat averts this, as he looks more and more roughed up, bandaged and wounded through the course of the game. The Painkillers could mainly be a way to 'continue' fighting, despite the wounds. A little far-fetched, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> is supposed to be.
</li><li> The third game shows that this behavior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">isn't entirely without consequence</a> — nine years later, Max is a barely-functional addict for those painkillers after downing them like candy for the entirety of the first two games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGetaway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGetaway">The Getaway</a></em> is a particularly fine example. You've been shot multiple times? No problem! Just lean on this wall for a bit. It even launders clothes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, you heal with poultices. As in, the stuff you rub on the wound (though it's likely just being used as an alternate word for "potion"). The animation accompanying use of a poultice is drinking it. Though oddly, the icons are actually poultices. Guess they just had the animation the same as Lyrium potions to save time. This gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> where one character complains to another that his healing potion tastes terrible, to which the healer snarks that you're not supposed to <em>drink</em> a poultice.
<ul><li> Which is the inverse of potions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>, which are used by sprinkling it over someone. Or occasionally <em>throwing the bottle</em> into their face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Return to Mysterious Island 2: Mina's Fate</em>, Mina's leg wound must be treated by using <em>decapitated ant heads</em> as impromptu sutures. This much is an actual medical technique, <a class="urllink" href="http://dareiread.blogspot.com/2008/02/ant-head-sutures.html">used by the Maasai people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. You make the living ant bite the two sides of the wound together and rip its body off, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.inriodulce.com/images/ArmyAntSutures.jpg">leaving the pincers still in you<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, and it tends to actually work. What makes this fall squarely into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">Worst Aid</a> territory is that you then apply raw herbs and a puddle-dipped rag to the wound—and that all of these items are procured by a wild <em>monkey</em>, all species of which are likely carriers for pathogens transmissible to humans.
</li><li> In the multiplayer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>, the Medic's only answer for reviving downed teammates who have been shot, stabbed, burned, or even <em>blown up</em> is to stab them with a syringe full of mystery chemicals. Plus, in the case of heavily wounded teammates, some medics won't even bother going through the effort of healing them and will kill the wounded teammate so he can revive him to full health instead.
<ul><li> Likewise, modern-set <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> games do the exact same thing, except with defibrillators instead of syringes.

If you do this to a leech in real life, it will vomit into the wound and increase the risk of infection. The <em>correct</em> way to remove a leech is to gently pry its mouths (yes, <em>mouths</em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">they have two of them</a>) off of the skin. Usually it's done with one's fingers, but Snake still resorts to using the cigar...even though he's equipped with a combat knife.

If your Medicine skill is sufficient you'll perform proper treatments (with congratulations from the attending doctor, who presumably is taking notes), but if it's insufficient you'll end up killing the patients in rather horrific ways, such as attempting a tracheotomy on a patient with a simple allergic reaction (he bleeds to death). You can also kill Caesar with improper brain surgery during "Et Tumor, Brute?" - or, wrapping this trope around into ridiculousness, heal him of that tumor with no medical skills, a lot of Luck, and <em>no idea how the hell you even did it</em>.
</li><li> The Y-17 trauma harness in "Old World Blues." See all the notes about how you should be very careful when moving a patient, and preferably not move them at all? Try a suit of armor that takes over the wearer's movements when they're badly wounded and then tries to walk their body to the nearest hospital. It's noted that the Y-17's method of transport killed most of its users far more effectively than their actual injuries, and even if it didn't, the harnesses also had issues with being overly sensitive (some would start walking back to a hospital at the slightest injury, if not for no reason) <em>and</em> the possibility that there was no defined hospital for them to walk back to — most Y-17 suits you can find are still walking around with the skeletons of their long-dead patients inside.

Its secondary attack allows the wielder to place on the ground point-up and <em>slam a victim onto the tip five times</em> before throwing them away like trash. This transfers five amounts of health from the victim to the wielder. Since you need to use a weapon many times before unlocking the next attack, it's not uncommon for healers to follow allies around and injecting them even when they're healthy already.

If Kenny is taken there, he will die, but it's a miracle that <em>any</em> of the kids taken there survive due to regular incompetance ranging from the head doctor just not having the faintest idea what's wrong, looking ridiculous by confirming that an exploded body is indeed dead, and diagnosing acts of physical bullying as serious medical emergencies, all the way down to such medical mishaps as replacing Kenny's heart with a baked potato in the movie; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut">South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</a></em>, sending Butters to a vet because he was made up as a dog in the episode "Good Times with Weapons", and the incident from the episode "Tonsil Trouble" where Cartman went there to have his tonsils removed and ended up with AIDS.

<ul><li> This is sadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, and happens many times, from negligent medical personnel to well meaning but ultimately clueless Samaritans.
<ul><li> Also, this is seen throughout most of history, due lack of medical knowledge, most medical treatments either didn't do anything to help, or actively worsened their condition. For example, medical bleeding was used on such a wide range of ailments, such as the plague, swelling, or the common cold, but it drained out the white blood cells needed to fight the infection.
</li></ul></li><li> Some British tropers who were in secondary school in the second half of the 1990s might recall an "instructional" First Aid video about putting someone in the Recovery Position when unconscious. The example used? A cyclist involved in a hit-and-run, a scenario with a <em>very</em> high probability of spinal injury. This might be a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, as recovery prospects for spinal injuries are a lot better than they were twenty years ago, but it's still cringe-worthy in hindsight.
<ul><li> Oh, and this same first-aid course apparently consisted of CPR, the Heimlich Manoeuvre and the Recovery Position and that was <em>it</em>. Nothing on recognising the symptoms of a stroke or heart attack—the subjects of major public-awareness campaigns so that people seek medical assistance before their condition becomes life-threatening—or dealing with burns, bleeding or a broken bone.
</li></ul></li><li> In one famous case, lifeguards were resuscitating a victim, but instead of breathing, they were saying, "breath, breath" as they did in practice.
</li><li> Lot of people give CPR the same way many actors do—with their arms bent and using almost no pressure and breathing in mouth without covering the nose. Others start right, but stop when ribs break, thinking they did it wrong. One of first things said in first-aid courses is "If you hear loud cracks, don't stop. Those were ribs. They won't need them if they die." The 2010 standards revision suggests that compressions are more valuable than ventilations and move some air on their own through the pressure on the chest, so anyone without training is requested to do compression only CPR.
</li><li> In Italian driving schools the teachers explain how to rescue victims of car crashes by keeping away anyone who isn't trained in first aid, specifically to prevent well-meaning but ignorant helpers from accidentally killing the patient.
</li><li> United States President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">James Garfield</a> was shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a> by a crazed office seeker in 1881. If the doctors had confined themselves to sewing him up and giving him chicken soup, Garfield probably would have lived. But since it was 1881 and the work of Louis Pasteur (the germ theory of disease) and Joseph Lister (antiseptic surgery) was not universally accepted, especially in America, the doctors spent much of the summer sticking unsterilized instruments and <em>their bare unwashed fingers</em> into Garfield's back as they tried to find the bullet. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut">We Have to Get the Bullet Out</a>. Garfield fell victim to out-of-control infection and died eleven weeks after he was shot. In fact, Garfield's assassin defended himself at his trial with the argument "The doctors killed Garfield, I merely shot him" (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth">technically true</a> if you ignore the fact that the doctors wouldn't have been giving Garfield the treatment that led to the infection <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingthePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingthePoint">had he not been shot in the first place</a>). The jury still found him guilty.
<ul><li> Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> decided to <em>leave the bullet in</em> after somebody tried to assassinate him, remembering that taking it out killed Garfield, surmising (correctly) that the absence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a> meant he was alright (the bullet had struck his metal glasses case and the notes to the speech he was going to give). He was also just that badass. He gave his speech anyway (starting by saying "Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose"), <em>then</em> sought medical treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> The practice of bloodletting (removing significant quantities of blood) was a common practice in the 18th century that may have (if not directly caused) hastened the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> following the first President becoming ill suddenly in December 1799. The rationale behind the practice was to remove the "bad blood" in the hopes that the disease would go with it. There is actually a use for bloodletting, and it is still used today, but only for a VERY VERY specific condition, called hemochromatosis, an excess of iron in the blood. The condition can result from a genetic defect (which makes it chronic), or an excess of iron introduced from blood transfusions. In these cases, carefully controlled amounts of bloodletting are used to relieve the iron overload. In this case, it's not called bloodletting, but therapeutic phlebotomy. This condition was not something that was known before the modern day.
<ul><li> Bloodletting was an ancient procedure, invented by the ancient Greeks. The original idea was that there were four "humors" of the body (blod, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) that needed to be kept in balance. It was thought that most diseases and even mental disorders were caused by excess of one or more of these humors. How the practice lasted so long when it at best did nothing and at worst killed the patient is anyone's guess.
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulderCarry">Over-the-Shoulder Carry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section, this as a result of the poor medical training most band crews/roadies tend to have probably exacerbated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi">Yoshiki Hayashi</a>'s neck and back injuries. Crew and roadies carried him off the stage in ways that, if you have any knowledge of spinal cord injury, are absolutely <em>cringeworthy.</em> After he actually broke his neck onstage in 1995, he was carried offstage by untrained roadies rather than left in place to be properly removed from the stage by paramedics with proper stabilizing equipment, and his crew did the same thing after he collapsed from exhaustion in 2008 despite having existing spinal cord injury and no neck brace at the time.
</li><li> If someone cannot walk under their own power and/or has had previous neck or back injuries (especially if they both can't walk/are unconscious AND have previous neck/back injuries), the proper way of handling the emergency is having someone call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyServices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyServices">Emergency Services</a> (911, 119, whatever your local number is) and mentioning the nature of the emergency, removing anything around them that could endanger them from being sharp or falling on them or being otherwise hazardous, and <em>not moving them.</em> Let the professionals do it.
</li><li> The aforementioned "treatment" for frostbite, rubbing snow on the affected area, was used until the 1950s which resulted in gangrene.
</li><li> In the days before anesthesia, British surgeon Robert Liston was famed not only for his skill in amputations, but his <em>speed</em> as well. Anecdotes from the era describe him as a doctor who took such great pride in the speed of his operations that he would declare "Time me, gentlemen!" before performing an amputation. One anecdote, in particular, speaks of one surgery with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">300% mortality rate</a></em>, killing not only the patient and a nurse holding down the (fully conscious) patient with gangrene when he cut off the patient's leg and the nurse's fingers, but a spectator who thought he got cut when Liston's bloody saw cut his coat, causing him to have a panic-induced heart attack.
</li><li> Telephone directories may include a brief First Aid and Survival section. One notorious passage from a few decades ago advised shaking an unconscious person by the shoulder while shouting Are you all right? Critics pointed out that this is especially useful if the person turns out to have a spinal injury.
</li><li> During his last wrestling match in March 2015, Mexican wrestler Perro Aguayo Jr. or Hijo del Perro Aguayo received a dropkick that propelled him against the ropes, with his head violently whiplashing against them. He remained limp, and throughout the rest of the match, both his fellow wrestlers and his ringside helpers carelessly tried to revive him by shaking him several times. Ultimately their blatant disregard for medical procedure mattered little, Perro had tragically died almost instantly. Still, it remains a glaring and very modern example of this trope in real life, one that was witnessed in real time by thousands both in the audience and those who were watching the event from their homes.
</li><li> In a particularly horrifying case that took place in the United Kingdom in 2014, a doctor <a class="urllink" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/decapitated-baby-doctor-mothers-womb-delivery-death-vaishnavy-laxman-tribunal-ninewells-hospital-a8344696.html">decapitated a newborn infant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after yanking on its body even though the mother's cervical muscles had spasmed and clamped around the child's neck; inexplicably, the nurse never even considered administering muscle relaxants and had simply opted to pull as hard as they could.
</li><li> In late 2017, a video began circulating from a wellness/alternative-medicine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> page, detailing a way (allegedly from a Chinese medical professor) that a layperson could save a stroke victim. It involved pricking their ears and fingers, which was supposed to somehow stabilize them and get the stroke to pass (or at least get their face to stop drooping) and <em>then</em> taking them to the hospital. Anyone with even a <em>minimal</em> amount of knowledge about strokes should know that you <em>immediately</em> call 911 (or 999, or whatever the number for emergency services is in your country) and get them to a hospital as quickly as you can, and let <em>trained</em> ER and stroke-unit staff take care of it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12be6s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12be6s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12be6s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Use the acronym <strong>FAST</strong>: look for <strong>F</strong>acial droop, <strong>A</strong>rm weakness, <strong>S</strong>peech problems, <strong>T</strong>ime to call EMS. Some also add <strong>B</strong>alance and <strong>E</strong>yes to that, forming the acronym <strong>BE FAST</strong>. </span> Pricking their ears and fingers won't help, and delaying treatment leads to brain damage, which could lead to the patient either dying or becoming <em>severely and permanently</em> disabled. The viral video is deconstructed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D-dzYkz7g4">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by an <em>actual</em> doctor.
