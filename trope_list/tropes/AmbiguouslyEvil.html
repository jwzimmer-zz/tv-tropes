<ul><li> Madiath Mesa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAsteriskWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAsteriskWar">The Asterisk War</a></em> is a worker for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Integrated Enterprise Foundation</a>, which would put him against the protagonists at first glance. However, his real intentions and goals are not revealed and he can be helpful to the protagonists once in a while. He defeated Haruka and caused her to fall into a coma, but is keeping her safe and waiting for her awakening. He also trains Ayato in how to unlock his final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a>.
</li><li> Schneizel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is, for most of the show's run, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Lelouch</a>. But for the most part, he comes across as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> or even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out, he's the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and is really quite evil.</span>
<ul><li> Lelouch fits this trope to a T. How sympathetic and selfish are his goals? And does his goals justify his means of trying to achieve them? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, though, this is made less ambiguous by his Zero Requiem. Lelouch adopts the role of an evil emperor and arranges his own assassination by Zero, now being played by Suzaku, so that the world can finally be at peace.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Near, at first. With his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a>, his robotic, stone-cold personality... it's hard to tell how good Near really is. However, much of his goal is to avenge his mentor L, and "How to Read" confirmed that he is a sensitive person.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, Shigure is usually a goofy slacker who is also something of a pervert. There are moments though, when he says some <em>very</em> creepy things. Unlike other characters like Rin or Tohru, he shows no interest in ending the Zodiac curse himself and says he's perfectly content to sit back and let other people do it while he reaps the benefits. He does want the curse ended, but it's mainly because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's in love with Akito and knows he can't have her all to himself as long as she's obsessed with all of the Zodiac members</span> rather than wanting everyone free. Despite these selfish views and the fact that he openly admits to being "the worst sort of man", he really doesn't do anything bad and some of the things he does, like agreeing to let Yuki and Tohru live with him, are very beneficial to the protagonists in addition to furthering is own ends..
</li><li> Heinz Windemere in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> mixes this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer">The Ditherer</a>. Although he reluctantly supports the Windemerean attacks on other planets, he is only doing it because he thinks its the best way to protect his people from foreign aggression. Also, he considers the possibility to make peace but he also wants the UN government destroyed. When Freyja begs him to stop the war, he ignores her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the finale, he teams up with Chaos out of pragmatism, not because he wants to bury the hatchet.</span> Calling him "evil" is a bit strong, but he is definitely an antagonist.

<ul><li> Gendo Ikari. At the start, he keeps it unclear whether he does care about his son, Shinji, and the world's safety or not. In the end, we learn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that it's neither, he's just obsessed with bringing back his wife and will use any means to do it</span>, but while he doubtlessly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">puts getting his wife back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">before anything else</a>,</span> the way he justifies his actions in episode 25 suggest that he <em>genuinely</em> believes that his version of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Human Instrumentality Project</a></span> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">the only way for humanity to survive</a>, his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">final words</span> make it pretty clear that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>did</em> care about Shinji, but happened to have the very same self-esteem issues Shinji has, and the same can be argued for Rei (given that <em>Fuyutsuki</em>, usually the more moral/sentimental of the two, calls him out on getting too attached to her)</span>, and he still opposes the <em>actual</em> villains of the show with the goal of doing what he thinks is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">protecting mankind</span>, ultimately making him more of a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a></span>. ...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">We think</a>.
</li><li> Kaworu Nagisa is another example; while he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is an Angel and tries to bring about Third Impact</span>, he eventually changes his mind and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decides to let Shinji kill him so humanity can live</span>. His motivations have been hotly debated, from interpretations ranging from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">naive but ultimately well-meaning boy who wanted the best for Shinji</span> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cruel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> who, when his plans for destruction of humanity failed, settled for pushing Shinji beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a></span>.

Then his 3D self makes a grab at Henry and scares him enough to try to leave. However, it's not clear why he's grabbing for Henry. Chapter 2 has Sammy Lawrence believing that Bendy is the one who will change him back into a human. The chapter also has more moving Bendy cut-outs and even a prank with the cut-outs moving between the orchestra pit and the balcony and increasing in number for failed attempts to solve the puzzles. 3D Bendy kills Sammy Lawrence, who was attempting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a> at the time, and chases Henry, but his motives for either of these actions remain unclear. If he catches Henry, he kills him, but then Henry revives. It's not clear if the death is canon to the story or simply a game mechanic. In Chapter 3, Bendy chases Henry whenever he sees him. He kills every thing that crosses his path in fact — all of them happening to be hostile. And again, he will kill Henry if he catches him and Henry will revive. Bendy also gets angry when his cutouts are destroyed. In Chapter 4, there are more beings who worship Bendy as their savior, and there is also a Lost One who is scared that "he" will find him again, but it's not clear if this refers to Bendy. 3D Bendy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> scares Henry in the vents</span>, but he doesn't attack him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>: Most of the big players in the backstory are heavily dependent on interpretation, the codifying dichotomy being that between the two Primordial Serpents, Kingseeker Frampt and Darkstalker Kaathe. Each will have you believe the other is deceiving you regarding whether or not to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> take Lord Gwyn's place as the fuel of the First Flame</span>. Frampt claims that not doing so will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, Kaathe claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> letting the fire die</span> will bring about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">Golden Age</a> of Mankind and that the current state of affairs are the unnatural extension of the Age of Fire. Neither case has a great amount of evidence to back it up.
<ul><li> Likewise, Gwyn himself is either the long tortured husk of a god sacrificing himself to save the world from the dark, or a selfish tyrant, unwilling to forgo the rule of giants and the subjugation of mankind. There's evidence of both interpretation s but it should be noted that everyone who speaks highly of Gwyn is explicitly a worshiper, relative or servant. We don't really get an outside account until Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2">Dark Souls 2</a></em>

He also claims that he didn't know the extent of Quentin's madness until too late, and never used the man's research until Meredith backed him into a corner. The writers have said that whether he is telling the truth is left for the players to determine.</span>
<ul><li> Flemeth from both games. She dismisses rumors without confirmation or denial, and there hasn't been a witness to or onscreen demonstration of her villainy. She's done more to assist the heroes, and her battle with the Warden was only in self-defense. Her power is said to come from demonic possession, yet neither her motives nor methods match any other examples. Morrigan discovers a ritual that supposedly permits her to possess others, but the reasons and results for using it have been cast in question.
</li><li> Her daughter, Morrigan, easily follows in her footsteps. Despite sticking with the Warden for the entire game, her true motives are left in the dark throughout the game, such as why she wanted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a child with the soul of an Old God</span>. She can also convince the Warden to slay Flemeth for her to prevent the aforementioned possession ritual, but Morrigan was the <em>only</em> one capable of reading Flemeth's grimoire where the ritual was mentioned, making it possible she lied simply to get her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">out of the way</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Witch Hunt</em>, Morrigan is initially reluctant to agree if the Warden requests to travel with her, believing that they — especially male Wardens who romanced her — wouldn't agree with or understand what she needs to do to enact her plans.

She is Mythal. What Mythal IS, that's the mystery, but most elves call her a goddess of love, motherhood, and justice. And then Solas, who is revealed to be THE Dread Wolf said to have betrayed the other elven gods, consumes most of her essence to continue the fight, making him ambiguous on whether he intends to uplift the elves or just sabotage everyone else.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> you come across something going by the name of Mouse during the Mage origin where your goal is to confront and defeat a demon. It acts as a helpful ally, pretending to be human, until you reach the end of the short mission where it hints about how it would be really helpful if you would agree to let it in so it could finally escape from here. This tips off the PC that this person is actually the true demon they were sent to face, but when revealed the demon is actually pleased that you saw its true nature and allows you to leave, implying itself to be one of the most dangerous types of demons in the process, Pride. Two game entries later we see that Pride demons are actually a corruption of Wisdom spirits, which are generally considered benevolent. So did you meet with a demon of Pride or a spirit of Wisdom back then? Is there really a difference?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, this is the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons</a>. While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">innate desire to dominate</a> leads to dragons being considered uniformly evil to most mortals, individual dragons can play with it in various ways. During the ancient Dragon Wars, most dragons were simply following the lead of their leader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse">Alduin</a>. In modern times, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, some dragons have shown the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">suppress their dominating nature and have even been able to work with mortals</a>, while many others simply prefer to be left alone.

In the game's secret ending, it turns out to have engeneered all the events of the game to ensure all three evil Ancients are killed in parallel timelines at the same time, destroying them for good. Whether it did this to protect humanity or to get rid of its competition is unknown. Though lore in the game indicates ancient people did worship it as a fertility god... basically, Mantorok is either the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Eviler Than Thou</a>, but it's impossible to tell which.

Joshua Graham implies that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> might have ties to Caesar's Legion</span>. He carries the flag of the Old World on his back, which has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">connotations</a>, and <em>Old World Blues</em> hints pretty strongly that he wants to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">do <em>something</em> in The Divide, related to waking up the Old World</span>. Though audio files from the same add-on detail him rescuing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Christine</span> from the Big Empty and nursing them back to health.

The game never seems to depict him as evil or even morally ambiguous, but he does some pretty shady things, to the point where he could easily have been the villain if he'd had a more prominent role in the story. His crimes include kidnapping a teenage girl with special powers and holding her hostage to force her homeland to build a massive lighthouse for him, stealing a magical ship and a life-extending draught from Lemuria, and abandoning his former friend Lunpa and stranding him there. Strangely, however, he's never called out on any of it, the heroes never question his motives or hesitate to work with him, and when it's mentioned he died offscreen in the sequel, the party -which includes the aforementioned hostage- seem sad to hear about it.
</li><li> The G-Man from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series has a rather ambiguous background, putting Gordon Freeman into stasis twice, while at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">the first game</a>, when Gordon chooses not to make the deal with him, the G-Man would just send him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">a dimension full of hostile aliens where he can't possibly survive</a>.

The Seraphites in the present are a bunch of crazy cultist murderers in a blood feud with the Washington Liberation Front. However, ex-Seraphite siblings Yara and Lev say that the current Elders in the cult are the people who've warped her beliefs and that there's nothing violent in what she taught. Adding further ambiguity is that if you ask Lev, he doesn't deny that she did blow up a truck and kill a bunch of soldiers.

</li><li> The Spathi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em> are a textbook example. They fight for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ur-Quan</a> and don't seem terribly upset about being party to the enslavement of all intelligent life, but while spineless and shifty they never come close to doing anything evil.

They are quite friendly, and will gladly ally with humanity...<em>but</em> there's something a little bit sinister about them. You meet them in Androsynth (evil cloned human) space, with no sign of the Androsynth anywhere. Demanding answers from the Orz as to what happened is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>, and they will attack if you keep bringing it up.

</li><li> Certain comments made by the Spathi leadership in <em>2</em> points to them being quite simply very, very cowardly. They are in fact upset about being party to the enslavement of all intelligent life — not really because they are opposed to enslavement, but because they don't want to risk themselves enslaving others (they actually wanted to be safely protected beneath a slave shield instead, just like the humans would be, but another slave race messed with the choice). Going against the Ur-Quan would be even more dangerous, which is why they keep co-operating.

By defeating him, he opens up a dojo where he can train your spirits to boost their attack and defense while lowering speed and jumping.

One of the most hotly debated examples in its time, the ambiguity of their true nature and morality is an extraordinarily unclear and controversial topic. Very little can be said for certain about this character's true goals, especially in regards to the game's backstory. They may have been sincere with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asriel</span> about wanting to kill only enough humans to break the barrier, or may have wanted to lay waste to their home village, or possibly to get revenge on the entire human race. <br/><br/>In addition, the game has many different story routes, and none of them are really "canon" or "non-canon"; what you personally played is what happened in your game. Therefore, it's easy to make a case in which the character is sympathetic if you only take into account the Pacifist run, but equally easy to argue for them being a villain if you only take into account a Genocide run, and the lines only get blurrier the more routes you take into account, in what order, and how many. Not too mention that it's difficult to say how much of the player's actions on any route <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chara</span> had a say in or not. <br/><br/>After completing a True Pacifist run, the player can walk all the way back to the first room of the game where they fell down, where they'll find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asriel</span>. If talked to, he'll say that he became so fixated on Frisk because he saw them as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chara</span>. However, he'll admit that this was an incorrect assumption, since, as a Pacifist, Frisk is "the kind of friend [he has] always wanted" whereas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chara</span> "really wasn't the greatest person" and mentions their vehement hatred of humanity. At the same time, they were beloved by the entirety of the Underground, despite the monsters' bad history with humans, are implied to have at least a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments in their past (Asgore's sweater, for example), and (if they are the narrator) are helpful, love dogs, and generally good-natured-if-snarky on the Neutral-and-better routes.

The bunny and dino are visibly creeped out by them when passing through their lands, and they all wear opaque glasses that shine in the darkness. One of the koalas stalks the bunny and dino with a sack on its back and snoops on the fortune teller's vision of the temple, implying that it was going to attempt to steal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the rabbit spirit or possibly other</span> treasure in the temple. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But when the rabbit spirit's temple starts collapsing, it quickly has a change of heart and joins them instead.

The reason he did this was to keep in check his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad scientists</a>, who were mostly waging an everyone-against-everyone war on ruins of a halfway-happened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> when he crashed the party.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">sorts of people</a> who <em>chose</em> the transformation and indefinite active military service are obviously dangerous, but "good sports" and honorable in their own strange way.

He has a spy among the protagonists, definitely has some sort of scheme going on, and actively goes out of his way to enhance his maniacal laughter with a device to simulate lightning, but he hasn't done anything outright evil yet. He did kill a king, but he was more of a tyrannical warlord than a benevolent ruler, and Deus did do it so he could help bring the country from a third world country into a modern nation.
</li><li> Amical from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Morphe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Morphe">morphE</a></em>. When he is introduced he is forcing people to fight one another to the death and kills 3 people in cold blood. After adopting the seedlings he legitimately cares about their feelings and becomes upset when he is accused of cruelty. The audience is always kept wondering if he just has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">a different set of morals as a mage</a> or if he is being pleasant for a greater and more sinister purpose.

Vaarsuvius is condescending and arrogant and doesn't really care much about saving the world; they just joined the Order in pursuit of Arcane knowledge and power, and are trigger happy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">their</a> use of magic. But they genuinely care for the rest of the Order, and are appalled by Belkar's psychopathy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They also made a deal with some fiends for some nasty dark magic to save their family from a vengeful black dragon, but used that magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">to destroy the dragon and all family members related to her</a>. They then held onto the power and used it to teleport the Azure fleet to an abandoned island where they could establish a base and get supplies, and used the magic to unsuccessfully fight Xykon. This eventually led to them losing their temporary power and divorcing their partner.</span>
<ul><li> Minister Malack, while working with the Empire of Blood and the unashamedly evil Tarquin, is mostly a pleasant guy who treats his differences in alignment and deity with Durkon as more of a friendly religious debate than enmity. He also seems to hold to a personal code of scruples. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out he's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampire</a>, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulEvil">Always Lawful Evil</a>.

</li><li> Yokyok of the Linear Guild. For the most part the Guild are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterparts</a> to the Order, but while their first Kobold member Yikyik was as evil as his opposite number Belkar, it's implied that Yokyok may differ as much in alignment from his party as Belkar does. His only goal is to get revenge for Yikyik's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">his father</a>) death by killing Belkar (who has it coming about a hundred times over). Nevetheless, he seems to have no qualms about letting the rest of the guild destroy a whole town if it means he can get to Belkar.

<ul><li> Everyone <em>thinks</em> Jhudora is evil, but no one has ever been able to prove it.
</li><li> The Oracle's true motives have never been made clear. She was introduced at the end of the War of the Obelisk as a seemingly benevolent ancient spirit. However, her actions are rather questionable. All she has done so far is to involve the six factions who originally fought for the right to open the Obelisk in perpetual battles simply for her amusement. She grants boons to the winning faction that last for one week, until it's time for yet another battle. It seems doubtful that a spirit who delights in watching frequent violence (and has multiple groups of powerful Neopians under her spell, constantly striving to gain her favour) could really mean well.

<ul><li> Notepad in the first installment. She's clearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>, but it's unclear whether she could be considered actually evil. The answer would depend on whether or not she deliberately drove the puppets insane or whether things simply got out of her control. So far, there's been no definitive answer either way.
<ul><li> The fact that she was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tortured along with the main puppets in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a></em> video and didn't appear with the others in episode six could indicate that she was the only teacher not affiliated with Roy.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Malcolm in the third installment. The way The Love Cultists talk about him makes him seem like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> (though they don't see it that way), but since he never actually says or does anything apart from moving his jaw it's unclear whether this doctrine actually comes from him or he's just a giant stone head and The Cultists are crazy enough to think he is giving them these messages.
</li><li> Though he seemed clearly evil in his first appearance, the fifth installment raises some questions as to the moral alignment of Colin the Computer. Specifically, the fifth installment implies that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red Guy's head exploding</span> (which may or may not have been Colin's deliberate doing) not only didn't kill him, but was actually a good thing since it freed him from the lessons. Whether or not Colin had any prior knowledge that this would happen is unclear. On the other hand, the sixth shows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the world Red Guy was sent to was so boring and dull that Red Guy actually preferred the lessons</span>, so it seems Colin-whether he planned for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red Guy to escape</span> or not-was a bad guy after all.
</li><li> Yellow Guy's father, Roy, is heavily implied, but not confirmed, to be evil. A number of the foods in the fifth video have "Roy's" on them, hinting that he might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">the cause of the puppet's situation.</a> He can also be seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithoutACrush">stalking them in the background.</a> In the HELP videos, after the puppets wake up to find they've been knocked out, kidnapped and tied up by an unnamed monster, Yellow Guy asks "Why are we at my dad's house?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drops the "ambiguously" in the sixth; he is confirmed to have been behind all the puppet's torture.</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MrDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MrDeity">Mr Deity</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lucy; she's generally the first to object to anything in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">the script</a>" promoting hatred or violence, and generally seems to reserve her tortures for those who genuinely deserve them, but she's also completely casual about arranging all kinds of eternal tortures for minor crimes in her first appearance, resolves in a meeting with David Silverman to "stop eating babies", and suggests inventing Nazism after Mr. Deity tells her to make an alternative philosophy to Jesse's.
</li><li> Mr. Deity himself could count as this. He rarely actually commits or condones evil acts, and he seems just as disgusted by many of the evil acts of his followers as anybody, but his refusal to actually prevent them is quite alarming; in the first episode, when given the choice of how much evil can be tolerated in his creation, he deliberately allows things like Down's Syndrome and natural disasters to exist for no real reason. He also loves the smell of blood and is responsible for the creation of Hell, the brutality and injustice of which is noted many times throughout the series.

By the fourth season, she's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> who will more often than not help out her friends.
<ul><li> Peppermint Butler can talk to you in your dreams, likes the taste of human flesh, just mentioning that you know him will get Death himself to do favors for you, and when Finn tried to expose his true aura, he embarrassingly remarked, "You don't want to see that." He's still a loyal butler to his princess, and occasionally helpful...that said, his princess is still on this list.
<ul><li> Also during his confrontation with the Master of Peace he turn two of the childs of him opponent in mosters to oblige him to give up, they looked happy, but Peppermint Butler used black magic, if the result of it in the pretendient of PB is a clue of how result it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">they are</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">propably less happy now</a>.And is weird that wanted to know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Vampire King</a>

Though she comes from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">evil</a> race and has willingly caused massive damage, she does not seem to have any real malice in her actions. Time will tell where she really falls.
</li><li> Lemongrab. He takes the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>" tropes and stretches them so far that we're not sure if he's evil or just extremely crazy and amoral. The worst thing he's ever done in the show is torture children in an electrical chamber, but it's possible that during this part, he was legitimately insane. He also appears to have a loving family, so it's complicated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">And then "Too Old" came along</a>, turning him into a tyrannical dictator who partially ate his clone and keeps shock collars on all his children...</span>
</li><li> Related to that, Princess Bubblegum. You can't help but wonder if she'll turn out to be evil by the series end. Case in point, her partial clone Goliad wound up going mad with power quite quickly, while her second "candy sphinx" Stormo is stated to be incorruptibly pure thanks to being a partial clone of the incorruptible Finn. What does that say about Bubblegum?
</li><li> The Ice King. He does a lot of bad <em>things</em>, but as the show goes on he's more and more depicted as mentally ill rather than truly evil.
</li></ul></li><li> There have been some hints given in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> that Rogers species are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. He can't live without being a bastard to everyone. In theory, he may actually be filled to the brim with doucheyness that causes everyone to be murderers or douches themselves. Add to that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntheBlood">Inthe Blood</a> for him to let out his "bitchiness" (before it takes the form of a poisonous bile that kills his species), in other words his entire race is essentially as big a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopath">Comedic Sociopath</a> as himself, willing or not (this is hinted at when his backstory is revealed, he was duped into being a crash test dummy for an aircraft traveling to Earth with the claims he was chosen to evaluate the human race, even placing an apathetic note to ignore the supposed crater and corpse the test would leave). Roger was clearly shocked that they'd use him as a test dummy, and originally there was nothing hinting that either Roger was the problem or he's actually a nice guy by the standards of his people. Other members of Roger's species are finally seen in "Lost In Space" with them being ruled over by the evil Emperor Zing. Of course, the emperor only went crazy due to Roger cheating on him, which Zing kept a secret from the rest of his people. and most of his subjects were disgusted by him when Jeff revealed the Emperor's deceit towards them. While its never stated why Roger was sent to Earth as a crash test dummy, the aforementioned episode strongly implies that Emperor Zing did this to Roger to get revenge on him for his affair as the rest of Roger's species, which makes sense because Zing was the emperor and Roger's offense towards him was in Zing's eye's tantamount to committing treason (and the reason why Zing chose Roger to go to Earth was because the man Roger slept with was a human from Earth).
</li><li> Nearly all of the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist</a> trope so far as to qualify for this, with Malory Archer and Algernop Krieger being the most extreme examples.

<ul><li> The masked and compelling Amon of Book I has a sympathetic backstory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">told by himself</a>, a number of legitimate points, a mysterious and horrifying ability that he initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">only used on the deserving</a> and a meticulous, effortless brand of manipulation that throws everything he says and all his motives into question. While he eventually goes past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> (even targeting children), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with his public backstory revealed to be a lie (with himself being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">Boomerang Bigot</a>), his true backstory is still a very tragic one, and</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brother Tarrlok</span> believes that Amon really does think that what he's doing is the right thing, thus keeping him under this trope.

They <em>do</em> try to eliminate bending from the world, but only in an effort to make things, well, equal. Though many are implied to be merely prejudiced and/or in it primarily for personal revenge, a good percentage of them see themselves as crusaders of justice fighting to reverse the perceived second-class status of non-benders by putting everyone on the same playing field. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Lieutenant</a> in particular becomes very angry when he sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">proof that Amon is a bender who's been using his own powers the whole time</span>.

<ul><li> Of course, there's also Varrick. If anything, being ambiguous is his schtick. Without a doubt he hates Unalaq, but there's signs he's not completely on Korra's side. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's been masterminding the Water Tribe civil war the moment Unalaq came and threatened his business. The conflict was inevitable, but Varrick decided to accelerate the war on his own terms by ordering his men to attack Unalaq.

All this to make a profit from the civil war, which was why he had to make sure the war goes on and that it escalates into something bigger.

When Star pushes for it in "Stranger Danger", the Magic High Commission is forced to admit they can't pinpoint any genuinely evil act (Hekapoo's worst memory of her is double-dipping sauce in a party and Omnitraxus's is her claiming that Rhombulus was annoying).

From the moment of their creation, Gems consider the Diamond Authority to basically be their gods, and the thing their type of Gem is made for to be their only reason for existing. To a Gem, good is serving your Diamonds will by doing the thing you exist to do to the best of your ability, and evil is... well, not doing that. If youre not directly under a Diamond, youre still serving under the Gem who is your rightful master according to the perfect order and will of the Diamonds. Gems openly talk about who they were made for or belong to without one trace of the way a human would hate to be spoken of as a piece of property or a thing that exists to be a means to an end. And even the Diamonds feel that it is their whole existence to be perfect leaders who perfectly enforce White Diamonds perfect order. Meanwhile, White truly believes that she is a perfect being and is spreading that perfection to the universe. None of them, from top to bottom, are motivated by personal power or gain.
