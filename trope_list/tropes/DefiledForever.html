<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>, it is apparently the preferred major tactical strategy of the forces of Seiryuu Star Warriors in neutralizing their rival forces of the Suzaku Star Warriors by raping/seducing their Celestial Maiden, and thus preventing her from summoning the patron god Suzaku (who required <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">Virgin Power</a>) who could then battle their patron god Seiryuu. Also used as a ploy into tricking their own Celestial Maiden into joining their side in the first place by turning on her best friend (who was the other CM). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, however, is a relatively uncommon male example of this trope, as it is later revealed to be what originally caused him to become evil.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden">Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden</a></em>, when Takiko discovers that the girl she helped is one of her celestial warriors... and doesn't stay a girl all the time. Takiko was very shocked when she woke up with a man in her bed, and freaked out, saying that she'd never be able to marry.
</li><li> A very common trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">yaoi</a> works, especially older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> laden ones, and occasionally in newer works. Thankfully, though, many newer works are just as likely to subvert or outright defy the trope. Just a few of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Boys' Love</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">yaoi</a> examples would be:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Soubi</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> after having been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> raped by his teacher</span> as a teenager, and now he's pretty much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>. Yeah, thanks a lot, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ritsu</span>. Also used to deconstruct the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsRiteOfPassage">Sex as Rite-of-Passage</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a>'s</em> Riki, who explains to his ex-lover that they can't get back together because another man's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">poison has seeped into his body</a> and he is now permanently tainted.
</li><li> Discussed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and ultimately defied</span> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KusattaKyoushinoHouteishiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KusattaKyoushinoHouteishiki">Kusatta Kyoushino Houteishiki</a>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample">Rare Male Example</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Masayoshi's brother Masami was sexually abused as a teenager and has many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">hidden issues</a> about it. He finally explains them to his boyfriend Tooru and says he considers himself soiled. Tooru then defies the trope via supporting Masami and telling him he's not defiled and that it's not his fault.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns">A Cruel God Reigns</a></em>: In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample">Rare Male Example</a>, Jeremy INSISTS that his body is rotting and that he gives off a bad smell as a result of the sexual abuse he is receiving from his stepfather. In a slight inversion of the trope, it is Ian, who is both the offender's son and Jeremy's love interest, that tries to convince him otherwise.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jeremy</strong>: It hurts to talk about my rotten smell with the person I like. <br/><strong>Ian</strong>: You don't smell strange. You don't smell rotten, Jeremy. <br/><strong>Jeremy</strong>: Did I make you dirty?
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>, two characters react this way to the 'threat' of being touched this way. When they complain about this, neither character would have an inkling of a thought of doing something inappropriate, so it's able to be played for humor.
<ul><li> Saki is worried about being seen as this whenever Hayate touches her.
</li><li> Hinagiku thinks she has been defiled and bemoans that she can't be someone's bride anymore when Ayumu drys her off after she faints in the hot springs. Ayumu says she'll still take her, and when reminded of her crush on Hayate, she suggests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">Polyamory</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterSchoolNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterSchoolNightmare">After School Nightmare</a></em>, as a kindergartener, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kureha</span> was brutally raped on her walk home from school; it's implied that this alone might not have been so bad, except that her father didn't give half a damn that his five-year-old daughter had been beaten and sexually violated, only complaining that she was now "damaged goods" that no man would want, and her own mother (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">who, incidentally, was frequently beaten by the father</a>) didn't even object.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em>, female lead Hinako is plagued by this way of thinking after she was abused by her stepfather and became pregnant in middle school. Much of the story is made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Daisuke</a> trying to get through to her despite her thinking this way about herself. The trope is very much defied by Daisuke's sister Izumi, who makes it perfectly clear to their somewhat old-fashioned and moralistic mother (and anyone else that tries to judge her) that she has no less self-respect for herself just because she got pregnant out of wedlock.
</li><li> Invoked and discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WolfGuyWolfenCrest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WolfGuyWolfenCrest">Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest</a></em>, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akiko Aoshika, the lead female, is gang-raped. The guy who staged her gang-rape, Haguro Dou, filmed said incident and is about to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">release it on the Internet for everyone to see to have her life ruined even further</a>. And for worse, Aoshika <em>already</em> considered herself defiled beforehand, having been sexually abused in her younger years.</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately defied: when she explains her backstory to lead male Akira Inugami (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">driven to tears</a> when he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a> the gang rape through a video), he tells her that no, not only she's not defiled, but <strong>he</strong> is the one who doesn't deserve her at all. This is reaffirmed via his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a> a few episodes later.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Guts is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample">Rare Male Example</a>. As a boy, Guts is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> raped by a fellow mercenary when his adoptive father sells him for three silver coins for one night.</span> This experience pretty much ruins Guts' life and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">turns him into the man he is in the present</a>. Then, he meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Casca</a>, and eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">they consummate their relationship.</a> But then Guts has an emotional breakdown right in the middle of the act and tries to leave because he thinks he's ruined and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">he's driven Casca away</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">But Casca doesn't</a> think this at all.
</li><li> And then it gets worse: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Their gang leader Griffith goes insane and rapes Casca.</span> She never gets over it, partly because by this point he's supernaturally crazy and anointed by GOD <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(said god is actually a manifestation of people's self-denial/ignorance of their evil)</span>.

The cinemas were flooded with overwrought melodramas dealing with virginal Aryan heroines driven to suicide after being raped or seduced by vile Jewish (or other racially "impure") men.

After her third "rape victim driven to suicide" role, she was given the monicker "Reichswasserleiche" (roughly translated as "Reich's Main Water Corpse") by the cinema-goers due to her favored method of dispatch usually being drowning. Needless to say, her own career drowned without a trace after the demise of the Third Reich.
</li><li> The 1940 anti-Semitic propaganda film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JewSuss1940" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JewSuss1940">Jew Suss</a></em> (also starring aforementioned Kristina Söderbaum and directed by her husband <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veit_Harlan">Veit Harlan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) is an especially notorious example of this trend.
</li><li> Söderbaum's first role of this type was In the 1938 film <em>Jugend</em> ("Youth"), also directed by her husband, where she plays a love-torn village girl who drowns herself after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">slut shamed</a> by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMonk">evil priest</a>.
</li><li> Kristina Söderbaum and Veit Harlan later made <em>Die Goldene Stadt</em> ("The Golden City") in 1943. Söderbaum once again played a naïve village girl who drowns herself after leaving her hometown for Prague, where she gets seduced and impregnated by her Czech cousin.
</li><li> Another 1943 German film <em>Romanze in Moll</em> ("Romance in a Minor Key") portrays a young Frenchwoman (this time played by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Hoppe">Marianne Hoppe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, another popular German actress of the period), who commits suicide by an overdose of sleeping medication after cheating on her husband with a lascivious music composer (played by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marian">Ferdinand Marian<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who also portrayed the Jewish villain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JewSuss1940" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JewSuss1940">Jew Suss</a></em>.)
<ul><li> Ultimately, the film turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>, because the heroine is not treated as a fallen and tainted woman and both her and her lover are portrayed in a sympathetic light.

There are even some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> that the other family members of the niece — and possibly even the niece herself - would want it that way.

</li><li> The movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus">Titus Andronicus</a></em> portrays the rape victim this way, as a way of justifying why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">protagonist</a> chose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">murder her</a>. Also crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>, since in the original play the implication that Lavinia is Defiled Forever is certainly present, but the fact that she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had her tongue cut out and her hands cut off</span> also appears to be a factor in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her father's</span> decision to kill her. Some productions make this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">marginally more acceptable to the modern viewer</a> by having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lavinia</span>, after naming her rapists, make it clear (non-verbally, obviously) that she wants to die, and by having her mention before it happens that she would rather die than undergo it.

Tess was raped by her employer while sleeping, and it's implied that she was raped again in the month in his service that followed before she slipped away in the dead of night. Because of this, her family and even her previously adoring and doting husband — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Angel</a> — consider her a ruined woman. Angel's reaction upon learning her dark and troubled past is especially egregious — he rejects her utterly, considering her an impostor and a monster that destroyed the Tess he was in love with (shockingly, he addresses she is not to blame for the rape). This comes on the back of his admission that he'd had a fling with either a prostitute or a desperate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">Christmas Cake</a>, and his being forgiven by her for it.

<ul><li> Worthy of note, however, is the fact that this viewpoint is only espoused by characters within the novel. The novel itself was actually considered groundbreaking for <em>not</em> playing the trope straight in the narrative voice.

Hester Prynne commits adultery and is punished by being forced to stand on a scaffold wearing the eponymous red "A" for <em>one hour</em>. The community's primary concern is getting her to say who the father of her baby Pearl is so that Pearl does not grow up without a father and, later, whether Hester is able to raise Pearl properly on her own. Hester chooses on her own to exile herself to the fringe of the community and keep wearing the scarlet letter because of her own guilt. The rest of the community, in fact, comes to think of her as a kind of saint because of her piety and charitable works. The only one who thinks Hester has been defiled forever is Hester herself, though the novel makes a point that despite Hester's mindset, she does not cripple herself to it and still manages to accomplish things in her life.

When word breaks out, people treat her like a prostitute until finally that's the only job she can take to save her daughter's life. As with the examples of Tess Durbeyfield and Hester Prynne, the novel is harshly critical of society's treatment of unmarried, non-virginal women (including prostitutes).
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WickedLovely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WickedLovely">Wicked Lovely</a> series — Ink Exchange is, when you take out the faeries and magickal tattoos, about Leslie reclaiming her life and body after being raped.
<ul><li> Same with Niall, as evidenced by his comments to Leslie about how they're survivors, although in his case he would have been Defiled Forever by mortal standards, but 1200 years is a long time to get over things.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyForbiddenFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyForbiddenFace">My Forbidden Face</a></em> (an autobiography written under a pseudonym) discusses this trope, though none of the characters in the novel get raped. The main character reflects that under the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taliban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taliban">Taliban</a>, a woman being raped would be forced to marry her rapist.

Margaret/Gretchen starts off as the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interest</a> popular in Goethe's time. Rumors spread when Faust knocks her up and Gretchen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother">Knight Templar Big Brother</a> Valentino decides to kill her "defiler".

Goethe does, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subvert</a> this when God declares Gretchen "saved".
</li><li> Completely averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a> books. Both Mercy and Anna have been raped, and while it is treated as a serious obstacle, both go on to have healthy enjoyable sex lives with their chosen mates.
<ul><li> Mercy notes that beating the hell out of her rapist helped a lot. She wonders if it will ever be a recommended therapy technique.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonk">The Monk</a></em> with Antonia; her rapist's enabler cites this as a reason to kill her, and Antonia tells her suitor that she doesn't mind dying since being raped means she couldn't have married him. However, other female characters like Marguerite (who was raped by her second "husband") and Agnes (who became pregnant not only out of marriage but while she was a nun) defy this trope and manage to have happy lives afterward; in fact, Marguerite's parents are specified as overjoyed to have her back and dissuade her from entering a convent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em>, Mitsuko didn't think this way after the first time she was raped. Unfortunately, the teacher she confided to <em>did</em>, and decided that since she was already ruined, he might as well rape her as well. At the book's start, she's an essentially broken individual and a danger to everyone around her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJoyLuckClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJoyLuckClub">The Joy Luck Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> One storyteller's mother is forced to become the mistress of a wealthy man after he rapes her and an evil employee of the house (who set up the rape in the first place) tells everyone what has happened and ruins the woman's reputation.
</li><li> Subverted in Lindo's story when she was forced into an arranged marriage. She escapes it by telling her mother-in-law that she was not the woman fated for her husband and that one of the household servants was. She "proves" this by insisting that the child she should have been impregnated with is actually being carried by said servant, claiming that she was impregnated by a ghost of an ancestor. In reality, the servant had just had an affair. The mother-in-law buys the story though, and the story ends with Lindo being sent off to live her own life while the servant marries the guy and is honored by the family, instead of ending up disgraced with an illegitimate child.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneRice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneRice">Anne Rice</a>'s <em>The Feast of All Saints</em> (and the miniseries based on it) play this trope deadly straight with Marie Ste. Marie. After her brutal gang rape, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> orchestrated by her sister</span>, she returns home only to have her mother scream at her repeatedly that she is "ruined" and then attack her. When she flees the house, she goes to the only place she can think of where she will be accepted: Dolly Rose's brothel. As Dolly later says "Sometimes they go to church, and sometimes they come here." Marie herself expresses this attitude to Anna Bella, saying she belongs in the brothel and that she deserved what happened to her.
</li><li> Invoked by Mary and Mr. Collins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> when Lydia elopes and endangers not only her own reputation and future but that of her entire family; Mr. Collins even goes so far as to say Lydia's death would have been a blessing in comparison. Neither of them seems to realize that pointing this out isn't helping anybody.
</li><li> Mary Vaughn from <em>The Neanderthal Parallax</em> trilogy manages to avert this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">While she is defiled at the start of the first book</a> by the second one she has already consummated the relationship with her love interest, and by the third book, they are onto making babies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> Rhett Butler took a girl out in his carriage without a chaperone and they got held up. Even though nothing had happened between them, the mere possibility that they might have done something naughty was enough for the girl's family to demand that he marry her. He refused and she was "ruined."
</li><li> Explicitly subverted with Barra from <em>Iron Dawn</em> and <em>Jericho Moon</em>. Although she was gang-raped after running off to see the Trojan War, it's specifically stated that this wasn't the event that codified her adult life: it's when she started <em>crafting the ax she used to hunt her attackers down</em> that she embraced her identity as an implacable mercenary warrior.
</li><li> Pops up in the Arthurian legend in strange places. Malory occasionally invokes this trope either through the rape of women or their willful adultery, and there is quite a bit of both. Most striking, however, is the rape by deception that Morgause uses to sleep with Arthur and beget Mordred, which is counted among Arthur's sins and failings that lead to his kingdom's collapse and his death.
<ul><li> It's even worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a>,</em> where Morgause's rape is counted as Arthur's only sin, as he is otherwise pure, upright, wise and cosmopolitan beyond anyone else in his time; the narrator outright states that it is this sin that seals Arthur's doom, even though he did not know he committed it (though the drowning of infants he attempts to solve the problem doesn't help). It's a really disturbing case when you stop and think about it.
</li><li> Interestingly, this may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a> if <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malory#Thomas_Malory_of_Newbold_Revel">one account<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Malory's life is correct.
</li></ul></li><li> More complicated than one might expect in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee">Judge Dee</a></em> books, considering that they're set in Tang China. It is expected that women will remain virgins until married (Dee scolds one man for his laxity in policing his household when it is discovered that his daughter - a murder victim - had been carrying on an affair for some months), and commit suicide if raped, especially after marriage (even if their husband is dead; one woman hangs herself because she feels an "unchaste widow" has no other option). On the other hand, prostitutes are not considered to be ruined by their "unfortunate profession", and can expect to find a marriage with an "honest farmer" if they can get out of said profession with a suitable dowry. Furthermore, Judge Dee himself disagrees with the tradition of suicide for rape victims, and in fact ends up making one such woman his third wife.
</li><li> Invoked and then subverted in Juanita Coulson's <em>The Death God's Citadel</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Aubage</a>, who was marrying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Ilissa</a> for position, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">considers her defiled and unworthy</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginTension">finding out she was raped</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Vraduir</a>. By contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Erezjan</a> cares only about how it traumatized Ilissa (with whom he's genuinely in love).</span>
</li><li> Diyet/Hariba of Maureen McHugh's "Nekropolis" views herself as this. First because of her brother's adultery, then because she sold herself into sci-fi indentured servitude, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because she falls in love with a biological construct instead of a real human</span>, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because she ran away from her home country and feels alien in her new country</span>, and finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because she has sex with the aforementioned biological construct</span>. The reader may be a little frustrated with her at the end (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">depressed</a>) but the original setting was an ultra conservative near future Muslim country, so it makes sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheActsOfCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheActsOfCaine">The Acts of Caine</a></em> gives us an interesting example. There's a religious sect of priestesses who are completely chaste virgins, to the point of dressing like men to stave off advances. If they ever give into temptation, they lose their power. If they are <em>raped</em>, however, they basically turn into a magic nuke. Unfortunately, they rarely survive the massive influx of power, not to mention the resulting destruction.
</li><li> After Artemisia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivilegeOfTheSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivilegeOfTheSword">The Privilege of the Sword</a></em> is date-raped by her betrothed, she tells her parents and brother what happened and that she doesn't want to marry him anymore. Their response is basically, "If you break the engagement and this gets out, you'll never get another husband."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, a man who has had premarital sex - or been raped - is considered this. Even if his family still accepts him, he's no longer pure, so they can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">sell or swap him for a man from another family</a>. The roots of this purity obsession come from the setting's complete subversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity">STD Immunity</a>; an STD in a married family quickly spreads to everyone and children are born dead or horribly malformed, to the point where entire families have been wiped out. A man who's been "defiled" usually ends up sold to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">cribs</a>, where he's rented out to women too poor to marry in hopes of impregnating them. A woman who's gone to a crib and/or had extramarital sex, aside from with other women, is also stigmatized for exposing herself to STDs - a noblewoman can't get marriage offers and mentions that people don't want her sitting on their chairs - but this is far more acceptable.
</li><li> Subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1632</a></em>: Gretchen is kidnapped to be an unwilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampFollower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampFollower">Camp Follower</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>. When she is rescued by Jeff Higgins she is surprised not only that he is willing to accept her but that he loves her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongAtDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongAtDawn">Song at Dawn</a></em> has two contrasting examples:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Alis</span> believes of herself after Raymond de Toulouse rapes her and puts her naked body on display for his vassals.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Estela</span> doesn't believe this of herself after a traumatic first time with a stable hand because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dragonetz</span> is still romantically interested in her and shows sympathy for her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieBurgis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieBurgis">Stephanie Burgis</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KatIncorrigible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KatIncorrigible">A Tangle of Magicks </a></em>, Viscount Scarwood eloped with a young woman. She's ruined forever; he's still a perfectly eligible young man, having wounded her brother and suffered no injury in a duel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimMarquitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimMarquitz">Tim Marquitz</a> has the Prince of Lathah consider his sister to be this <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBloodWarTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBloodWarTrilogy">The Blood War Trilogy</a></em> when she becomes pregnant by one of her guards. It's subverted by the fact she's still a Princess and has an endless number of suitors eager for her hand.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">Barsoom series</a></em>, this trope is subverted: females are lauded for killing themselves rather than endure such a shame. On the other hand, those that who are unable or willingly to do so suffer no diminished reputation. Princess Thuvia of Ptarth was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">slave concubine</a> to White Martian slavers for 15 years, yet she still has suitors such as Carthoris and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush">Prince Astok</a>, who pay no mind to it.
</li><li> While the continent of Westeros in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> is no stranger to this concept, in the case of Robb Stark, despite already being in a marriage agreement, he weds Jeyne Westerling, with whom he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace">slept upon hearing of his siblings' deaths</a>, in order not cause her any dishonor. The consequences of breaking his word end up being very dire for him though.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods">The War Gods</a></em> at least among hradani. Bahzell rescues Farmah after she is raped in the first book and when she turns up again in the next book she is happily engaged with no stigma attached (although her fiancé is a little upset that Bahzell killed her rapist before he could).
</li><li> Played with in <em>And I Darken</em>. Lada refuses to sleep with Mehmed because she believes this, but everyone else averts it. While premarital sex does do this in Ottoman society, Lada's still covered, since technically she is a part of Mehmed's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem">Royal Harem</a> and therefore fair game under Islamic law.
</li><li> Swerved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYoungAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYoungAncients">The Young Ancients</a></em> with the character of Ursula, the fiancée of the crown prince of Noram, who becomes pregnant by a political enemy of his. Exactly nobody cares about her having lovers or even bastards, but she's now unsuitable for a royal marriage precisely because, as she should have understood, her <em>first</em> child must unquestionably be her husband's, the future king. After some fuss trying to figure out a face-saving solution, she is married off to an entirely fictitious minor noble and sent to a remote country estate with a stipend. After a discreet period has passed, her "husband" will tragically die in a riding accident, and she and her child will be welcomed back to court.
</li><li> In the novelization of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dragonheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a></em>, this is Kara's major concern after being raped by King Einon. (In the film it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a>, but implied to have been unsuccessful.) As she says to Bowen later, "What can wash away the stain of soiled innocence?" Bowen is a subversion of the trope, however; he's in love with Kara and insists that this doesn't change anything about his feelings for her. It's also worth noting that only four people are aware that the event ever took place - Einon, Kara, Bowen (to whom she related the matter), and Einon's mother Aislinn, who helped Kara escape afterward.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate">Caliphate</a></em>, Petra is brutally raped by her owner's son and his friends, but she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">declared guilty of leading them on and therefore it's her own fault she was raped</a>. The judge sentences her to be auctioned off and she is turned into a prostitute, where she is repeatedly abused by the costumers. By the time she meets John Hamilton and becomes attracted to him, she doesn't believe he could be genuinely in love with her since she is just a "filthy whore". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ultimately subverted, as he falls for her nonetheless and he proposes to her at the end of the book</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Charly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Charly">Charly</a></em>. Sam thinks that she can no longer marry Charly because of her past sexual transgressions, but his bishop convinces him that if God can forgive her, so can he.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretsNotMeantToBeKept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretsNotMeantToBeKept">Secrets Not Meant to be Kept</a></em>, Martha Plunkett, who runs a toddler sex ring disguised as a preschool, invokes an age-appropriate version of this trope, telling the kids that their parents won't love them if the parents find out about the molestation. Of course, as such warnings from child molesters often are, this is a lie.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PatienceAndSarah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PatienceAndSarah">Patience and Sarah</a></em>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a></span>, Sarah feels disgusted and embarrassed. It takes Patience's gentle words to help her out of her self-loathing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic">Schooled in Magic</a></em>: This attitude exists toward women who lose their virginity outside wedlock (at least if they aren't magicians, who are not bound by normal rules), with no one else willing to marry them. Emily thus keeps on the female servants of the previous Baron (who apparently raped them) employed so they'll be able to make a living.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheConqueror">Shadow of the Conqueror</a>,</em> the Tuerasians brand the foreheads of those guilty of fornication or adultery so everyone will know their social shame. Hamahra fulfills the trope in a different way by viewing rape victims as damaged goods, a cultural element which the Tuerasians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">condemn as backwards and barbaric</a>. Sharra in particular worries that her family will throw her out after her brief time as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>, which prompts a particularly visceral response from Daylen.

</div></li><li> Ariane, the heroine of the medieval bodice-ripper <em>Enchanted</em>, was considered this by her father after she was raped. Even worse, he doesn't believe that she was and instead thinks that it's she who seduced her assailant.
</li><li> Happens to Rebecca in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GirlsWithSharpSticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GirlsWithSharpSticks">Girls With Sharp Sticks</a></em> after Mr. Wolfe sexually assaults her at the academy's open house.

In a later season, she goes undercover as an inmate and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience">a prison guard attempts to force her into oral sex (and is stopped, not even touching her)</a>, which is pretty much her worst nightmare come true. She develops PTSD, and for the rest of the season, there's an ongoing subplot about whether she will be able to keep doing her job after experiencing such a trauma.
</li><li> Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in a season 1 episode where a TV journalist goes public with her rape story in order to put it behind her.

</li><li> In another episode, Olivia refuses to believe a victim who claims to have recovered psychologically from being sexually assaulted — the rest of the episode shows she <em>hasn't</em> (she ends up becoming a vigilante), but even before that plot twist happens, Olivia's disbelief is presented in a way that suggests that nobody <em>ever</em> comes to terms with being raped. This likely has a lot to do with the fact that Olivia's mother almost certainly never came to terms with being raped.
</li><li> In yet another one, a young immigrant woman is horrified of having to admit she was raped out of fear that her brother and herself will be deported, and because she's Muslim and therefore no longer capable of finding a husband. Olivia and Casey Novak tell her that her brother doesn't have to find out, as he's more rigid about their religion than she is, but he does anyway. Rather than attack his sister, he attacks Casey, thinking she's the reason his sister isn't "clean" anymore and that by savagely beating her he's saved his family's reputation.

<ul><li> Some versions of the myth of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">Medusa</a> has her getting raped by Poseidon, then, as punishment for being so tempting, she's transformed into a gorgon. Quite a lot of victims of divine rape in Greek mythology were transformed or blasted by gods who were angry but couldn't take it out on the divine partner.

<ul><li> Deuteronomy contains a law that states that a woman is not guilty of sexual misconduct if there is evidence that she was forcibly raped (for instance, she was heard crying for help) or if it cannot be proven that she <em>didn't</em> resist.
</li><li> Another law states that a man who rapes a woman has to compensate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">her family for the reduction of the bride price they deserve for her</a>, and, should she decide she wants this option, marry her without the option of divorce. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">The story of Amnon and his half-sister Tamar</a>, in 2 Samuel 13: After Amnon lures Tamar into his rooms while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick">Playing Sick</a> and rapes her, Tamar herself says to him that <em>his rejection of her afterwards is even eviler than the rape.</em> This implies that the law is meant to force the rapist to provide for his victim now that he has put her in such a terrible position culturally. The marriage option was simply one of many ways to make the man responsible for his actions, as was the payment of silver to the girl's father. Reading through the laws, the penalty for rape falls on the head of the attacker. The only reason the woman would be punished is if she willingly slept with the man (or was suspected to have done so) since that broke the laws of fornication.
</li><li> In Genesis 34, Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob, is raped by Sechem of the Hivite. Then the rapist demands that his father Hamor (the local chieftain) get Dinah for his wife, apparently trying to invoke 'marry me or be defiled forever'. It doesn't work. Jacob's sons go overboard in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageofRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageofRevenge">revenge</a>; Simeon and Levi, having led the slaughter, lose the possibility of being considered next in line for head of the tribe after Reuben (the eldest) loses <em>his</em> right.
</li><li> Exodus contains a law that states that anyone (male or female) who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">has sex with an animal</a> is to be executed. The animal is also considered Defiled Forever and must be slaughtered.
</li></ul></li><li> In the New Testament, this trope is averted; sexual immorality defiles, but not irredeemably. Paul says in the sixth chapter of 1 Corinthians that a believer's body is considered a temple of God, which is defiled when it's involved in sexual immorality. But it doesn't say defiled <em>forever</em>—and Paul had just said in the same chapter that some of his audience used to be "sexually immoral" before they were "washed" and "sanctified".
<ul><li> In St. Augustine's writings, this trope is averted in the case of rape. He says that if a maiden is raped and doesn't consent in spirit, then she is still a virgin just as if she wasn't raped because she did not bring the rape upon herself and she maintained her purity in mind throughout the experience.
</li></ul></li><li> This may be the reason Lucretia of Roman mythology (and likely history) kills herself after naming her rapist. The other is that, in general, Roman nobles were <em>required</em> to commit suicide once their honor was sullied.
