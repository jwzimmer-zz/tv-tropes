If you've bought a DVD, it's assumed that you like the movie or TV show or whatever. Fair enough. It seems logical that a good chunk of the viewing audience would want to know more information about the film they're watching, and also to have a compelling reason to rewatch a film you've seen in the theatre. The creators or other experts get together to record an audio (and rarely, video) track to be played during the movie. This track comments on the production process.
</p><p>Though its inclusion is increasingly common, there are several famous directors who refuse to allow commentaries to be recorded for their DVDs. The most famous examples are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a>. Spielberg says he doesn't want to distract the viewer from watching the movie and anything he has to say about the film can be found on the DVD features. Lynch is insistent on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a> issue and doesn't want to give his own, 'definitive', interpretation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> works he's famous for (it's for the same reason that he's a master of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> has stated that he hasn't seen any of his films since they were released (and most of the DVDs don't even feature stereo sound). Allen has also given the explanation that he thinks movies should stand on their own merits.

</p><p>At their best, DVD commentaries can be a wealth of informative, entertaining insights into the creation of the film, especially if the speakers are adept at the process. They may also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the canon answer</a> to things that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">need some explanation</a>. At the midpoint of quality, everything in the commentary is interesting, but was already discussed in other (shorter), special features on the DVD — making listening to it feel sort of pointless. At their worst, it can quickly devolve into an awkward self-congratulatory session.
</p><p>Sometimes, the commentary is nonexistent for long stretches, sending you grasping for the remote to see if you inadvertently turned the track off. A rule of thumb is that commentaries which feature more than one person commenting together (in the same studio, not spliced together) will be more entertaining (though not necessarily more informative) than a solo track. Some filmmakers have started including subtitles for the commentary.

</li><li> <em>The Wings of Honneamise</em> has a commentary by the director and assistant director, and gives a lot of insight in how the film wouldn't have been as well-received as it was if they didn't basically just sit back and constantly take input from other members of the project.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> features a commentary track, which involve several of the voice actors—in some cases, even for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">the secondary characters</a>!

</li><li> At the end of the movie, they (jokingly) discuss the potential sequel, "<em>Eva 2: Electric Boogaloo</em>" (Made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> due to the now-popular "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> = sequel" theory.)
</li><li> Don't forget <em>Death &amp; Rebirth</em>, for which they recorded a separate commentary which also included some moments of comedy gold (and a few surprisingly insightful observations about the movie — ever notice that the opening shot of EoE is a mirror image of the closing shot of <em>Death</em>?). Best (or, some might say, worst) of all we get to hear about some Spike Spencer outtakes that tragically never made it onto the DVD, such as one in which he apparently made up a song based on an Unintentionally (though you can never be too sure with Eva) phallic-looking shot of Gendo in the graveyard entitled "Shadow Bone".
</li><li> Also on the subject of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Eva</a> commentaries, the TV series got a few of its own with the Platinum edition, ranging from <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGreenfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGreenfield">Matt Greenfield</a> and the sound editors divulging largely uninteresting technical details about the remastering process to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">explanations</a>" of the series' symbolism from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">Promoted Fanboy</a> Sean McCoy, and probably most interesting, an episode with commentary from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer">Spike Spencer</a> in which he actually admits to being emotionally invested in the character and a rare commentary from the elusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllisonKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllisonKeith">Allison Keith</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a> 2.22</em> features a "commentary" of sorts — actually more like a series of interviews between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland">Mike McFarland</a> and various cast members (in order: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer">Spike Spencer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrinaPalencia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrinaPalencia">Brina Palencia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant">Tiffany Grant</a>, Allison Keith-Shipp, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSwasey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSwasey">John Swasey</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrinaNishimura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrinaNishimura">Trina Nishimura</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">a sound engineer</a>).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes">Planetes</a></em> includes commentary from the Japanese voice actors, director etc, with an interesting twist.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, animated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise">same studio</a>, does it too, and also has (sober) commentaries from the American dub crew. They're all interesting, but sadly not as funny as the <em>Planetes</em> commentaries (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">butts!</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> A number of recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> distributed works have these done by the English voice actors and script adapters. They range anywhere from just a little bit snarky to pretty damn snarky (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPatton">Chris Patton</a>, for example, is <em>never</em> going to let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Jacuzzi Splot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">live that name down</a>).
</li><li> The DVD release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a></em> has the <em>characters</em> rather than the creators comment on the episodes, with dialog written by the author of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a>, which basically consists of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTing">MSTing</a> themselves. And wondering where the stalkers with the cameras had been hiding all this time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has audio commentary by a rotating group of actors and staff, the only constant being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama">Jun Fukuyama</a> (Lelouch's seiyuu). There is some semi-official discussion, but mostly it tends to be stream-of-consciousness rambling. Sometimes this provides interesting insight into the show's production or answers questions relevant to a specific episode, but a lot of it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">just funny</a>, like the discussion of Ohgi's perm ("The hairdresser probably screwed up, then lied and said it looked awesome to cover her tracks."), trying to figure what Zero's mask is made of (the four lead actors eventually settle on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-reinforced_plastic">fiberglass-reinforced plastic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), and getting to hear first-hand that the people who made the show love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Jeremiah</a> just as much as the fans (as seen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmiKoshimizu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmiKoshimizu">Ami Koshimizu</a> chanting "Orange, orange, orange..." just before the bridge scene in Episode 4).
<ul><li> Not to mention there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">once per commentary</a> session of affectionately bashing Lelouch. Topics include his fitness ("Even though he has no endurance, he still ran up all those stairs. I'm proud of him"), his plans (often the childishness of them), and his, um, fabulousness ("He must have practiced that. He wouldn't have wanted to get it wrong in front of everyone...")
</li><li> For extra fun, the final episode has two different commentary tracks, one with the four lead actors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama">Jun Fukuyama</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakahiroSakurai">Takahiro Sakurai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana">Yukana</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmiKoshimizu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmiKoshimizu">Ami Koshimizu</a>), and another with staff members like director Goro Taniguchi and head writer Ichiro Okouchi, who are also the creators of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The commentary tracks for the English DVD releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellsingUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellsingUltimate">Hellsing Ultimate</a></em> are both informative and at points downright hilarious. They are fronted by dub producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaliesinJaffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaliesinJaffe">Taliesin Jaffe</a>, who is joined usually by 2 voice actors whose roles are prominent in that particular episode. Jaffe regales viewers with tales of dining with Mr. Hirano and discussing with him how the dub should sound, whilst the various voice actors discuss their characters, stories of conventions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman">Crispin Freeman</a> apparently cosplayed as Alucard at one, and part of his payment was that he would get to keep the outfit; Jaffe got the throne), awful theatrical productions, comparisons of English and American acting techniques, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors">The Warriors</a></em> references. All recall the terrors of matching mouth flaps, working on the previous anime adaptation and how the Ultimate version differs, getting yelled at over "obviously fake" British accents <em>especially</em> when the actor is genuinely British, and Jaffe's in-depth research probably getting him on every government watch list ever.
<ul><li> Ralph Lister (Walter) describing Schrödinger's sexuality as a "moist bud", causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KariWahlgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KariWahlgren">Kari Wahlgren</a> (Rip Van Winkle) to be disgusted ("Don't use the word <em>moist!</em>").
</li><li> The English actors unexpectedly crushing the Americans in the game of Turn Everything Anyone Says Into A Euphemism, temporarily driving Jaffe to despair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">And tax advice!</a> (Specifically: if you like creepy books, work on an anime that justifies declaring your creepy books a business expense.)
</li><li> Every commentary past the series midway point also somehow manages to bring up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>, primarily in that vampires <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck">should not sparkle</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> has commentary, in Japanese, from the director being interviewed by a Japanese-speaking American, with subtitles provided.

</li><li> When Central Park Media rereleased <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAko">Project Ako</a></em> on DVD, they went an extra step and included a full-length commentary from the movie's director (with subtitles, to boot — allowing one to watch the film AND read the commentary at the same time, which was actually pretty neat).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> actually did DVD commentaries for some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> movies. Specifically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Mewtwo Strikes Back</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3">Spell of the Unown</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever">Voice of the Forest</a></em>. The first two of these feature the show's head writers, Norman Grossfeld and Michael Haigney. The one for the fourth movie features Grossfeld and Haigney <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">with most</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachaelLillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachaelLillis">of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaddieBlaustein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaddieBlaustein">main cast</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> English DVDs had this. Since the episodes are five minutes long, there were varied result of off-topicness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricVale">Eric Vale</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryJewell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryJewell">Jerry Jewell</a> somehow got on the topic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">strippers, crack, and cheeseburgers.</a>
</li><li> The R1 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> Remix DVDs have some episodes with commentary by the English crew and actors, while other eps have subtitled commentary by the Japanese. Mushroom Samba deserves special mention, as the claim that Ed was at least partially inspired by composer Yoko Kanno starts to become a <em>lot</em> more believable.
</li><li> Several English <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> releases include exclusive English commentaries with people in the North American industry who are big fans of Lupin, including Mike Toole (an editor at Anime News Network) and Reed Nelson (who runs the fan site LupintheThird.com).

</li><li> The English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a> DVDs include one or two commentaries per set.
<ul><li> The commentary for episode 335 (a filler episode) actually has a joke storyline following ADR director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelMcDonald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelMcDonald">Joel McDonald</a> interviewing the cast and crew in bizarre circumstances such as robbing a bank, living in a homeless shelter and even persuading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland">Mike McFarland</a> not to jump off a building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">because of how much work the show is</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear">Brother Bear</a></em>. The commentary is performed by the two moose, Rutt and Tuke (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, fully in character) as they watch the (entire) movie themselves, presumably in the comfort of their own "home": their silhouettes occasionally appear over the screen, MST3K-style, one of them makes popcorn, and they order pizza. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes one of the best jokes of the commentary, when half an hour later, the pizza guy shows up and the two of them completely panic at someone at the door; once they calm down, the pizza guy begins watching the movie with them for a few seconds before they tell him to leave.</span> It is entirely worth watching the entire movie a second time just to listen to these two.
</li><li> <em>Jonah: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a> Movie</em> has two normal commentary tracks, and one track done in-character by Larry the Cucumber and Mr. Lunt, who spend several minutes talking about Mr. Lunt's disturbing theory to origin of hush puppies.
<ul><li> Don't forget the discussions about their producer roles, Wisconsin Dells, Krispy-Kreme Donuts, and the Jack in the Box drive-thru.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> 60th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray has a picture-in-picture commentary titled, "Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland", in which historians of animation and/or children's literature give a vast amount of information on interpretations of the <em>Alice</em> books, the relationship between Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell, and Walt Disney's decades-long journey to bring those books to animated life. Their comments get accompanied by such visual aid as concept art, pictures of people involved with either the books or the movies, and live-action reference footage.

</li><li> Directors David Molina and Terry Shakespeare recorded one for the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> film. As befitting of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> title, it's nothing special either, but they reveal some nifty details, point out references and inform us that executive producer/story writer Bob Thompson kept making strange monster sounds with his mouth during production.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie">The LEGO Movie</a></em> notably has one part where the cast and directors decide to call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBanks">Elizabeth Banks</a>, who couldn't join in on the commentary, and put her on speakerphone and basically describe what's happening in the movie at that moment to her, while she's eating lunch at Subway.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em> didn't have a commentary track, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks">RainbowRocks</a></em> did, featuring VP of Development Michael Vogel, Executive Director Brian Lenard, Writer Meagan McCarthy, and supervising directors Jayson Thiessen and Ishi Rudell.

</li><li> Director Tom Shadyac recorded a solo commentary track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiarLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiarLiar">Liar Liar</a></em>. He's pretty serious, but he also tells a really nice story about taking Justin Cooper, who played Max, to meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a> at Carrey's house. Apparently, Jim and Justin got along really well.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em> DVDs often come with commentary from directors, actors, writers, and producers. These are hilarious, and YMMV about when they start become more entertaining than the actual films.

Cameron is busy discussing behind-the-scenes work, while the actors are goofing off and having a great time with each other. It continues all the way over the end credits.
<ul><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulWSAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulWSAnderson">Paul W.S. Anderson</a>, Sanaa Lathan, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanceHenriksen">Lance Henriksen</a> is more entertaining than the film itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchormanTheLegendOfRonBurgundy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchormanTheLegendOfRonBurgundy">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a></em> features a surreal but hilarious fake commentary, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillFerrell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillFerrell">Will Ferrell</a> talks about hookers and gets drunk with the director. Then, two actors who didn't get cast in the movie show up, and attack Ferrell. Then, after that, Lou Rawls, of all people, shows up!
</li><li> Ventriloquist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffDunham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffDunham">Jeff Dunham</a>'s DVD of <em>Arguing With Myself</em> has a commentary track. As one of his character's puts it when you launch it, 'if you're watching this, you have too much time on your hands!' At the beginning of the commentary he admits he really doesn't know why a commentary track to a comedy ventriloquism act is even necessary, but the directors wanted to include one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheaperByTheDozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheaperByTheDozen">Cheaper by the Dozen</a></em> has several commentaries, by the older actors and creators, and then another with several of the child actors. This second commentary is absolutely hilarious, the kids going wildly off subject and clearly having a lot of fun.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a> is well noted for his commentaries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine">Bowling for Columbine</a></em> features commentary recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore">Michael Moore</a>'s interns and secretary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bound1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bound1996">Bound (1996)</a></em> features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWachowskis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWachowskis">The Wachowskis</a> along with the woman they consulted for the portrayal of lesbianism. Jennifer Tilly also shows up in the last 20 minutes. The track is notable for being the last time the Wachowskis did anything related to promotion for one of their films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBuckarooBanzaiAcrossThe8thDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBuckarooBanzaiAcrossThe8thDimension">The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension</a></em>
<ul><li> The audio commentary takes the rather surreal tactic of claiming that what we're viewing is an adaptation of actual events. The commentators include the "real person" on which one of the secondary characters was supposedly based, and they go so far as to constantly explain how the events depicted differ from "what really happened" and make comparisons between Peter Weller's portrayal and the "real" Buckaroo. (At least this is equally odd as the movie.)
</li><li> The DVD also contains a subtitle track that provides <em>additional</em> commentary with the same conceit. The subtitle comments are consistent with the audio commentary, but its author seems to be privy to additional details not known to the audio commentators.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie</a></em> parodies the unappreciated status of commentary tracks by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having the characters turn on the commentary in order to learn what they need to do to solve the problem they faced at that point. Several of them comment such things as "who cares about this crap?" and look very angry and impatient while they wait for the information they wanted.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></em> features one of the earliest "drunken commentaries." Director Trey Parker repeatedly comments on how his character's wayward horse is a thinly disguised allegory for his break-up with a former girlfriend, which he is apparently still bitter about at the time of the commentary. At the end, the commentators decide to go to a titty bar, and the last comment heard is one challenging the other to a fight.
<ul><li> Specifically, they <em>begin</em> the commentary sober, but openly declare at that point that they will be drinking during it and you can even hear the alcohol being opened and served. In case you thought they were faking it though, there's an entire segment where the commentary cuts out...and then picks up as if nothing happened.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orgazmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Orgazmo">Orgazmo</a></em>, also by Trey Parker and featuring Matt Stone, continues the tradition of drunken commentary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em> each reunited their now-adult child actors for commentaries.
<ul><li> A point of interest about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em> commentary track: Occasionally during the film, the viewer is treated to the sight of all the now-adult stars sitting at a long table watching it, while the movie shrinks away into the corner of the frame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin">Sean Astin</a> unfortunately had to leave the session early to honor a prior commitment (leaving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MiddleEarthFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MiddleEarthFilm">Samwise Gamgee</a> action figure in his place), never getting to finish a personal message to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CyndiLauper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CyndiLauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The director's commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancerInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancerInTheDark">Dancer in the Dark</a></em> reportedly consists mostly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier">Lars von Trier</a> bitching about how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Björk</a> sucks. Not in a teasing way or as a way to make the commentary interesting — he actually means it.
<ul><li> Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier">the director</a>, it's almost certainly not "reportedly."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> used to host a program called "Cinema Interruptus" during the University of Colorado's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_World_Affairs">Conference on World Affairs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He and the audience would watch a movie on DVD in an auditorium and pause the film whenever someone has something to discuss. His notes from the event are incorporated into DVD commentaries for the films.
<ul><li> His commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkCity">Dark City</a></em> shows you just <em>how</em> brilliant the film is, pointing out visual motifs, cinematography tricks being used, and just how perfectly the movie's playing with Noir archetypes. The DVD's worth it for the commentary track alone.
</li><li> Ebert also contributes an excellent, in-depth commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em>. Again, notable for the breakdown of cinematography, shot design, and other interesting tidbits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DodgeballATrueUnderdogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DodgeballATrueUnderdogStory">DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story</a></em> features two commentaries, the first of which featuring Marshall Thurber, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceVaughn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceVaughn">Vince Vaughn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller">Ben Stiller</a> arguing for 40 minutes whereupon all three exit and the commentary is replaced with that from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheresSomethingAboutMary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheresSomethingAboutMary">There's Something About Mary</a></em> DVD. The second (serious) one is an Easter Egg.
</li><li> The commentary track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElMariachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElMariachi">El Mariachi</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRodriguez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a> pointing out all the goofy tricks he was forced to use to fit into his $7,000 budget.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eurotrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eurotrip">EuroTrip</a></em> features the crew playing a drinking game during the movie.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious2001">The Fast and the Furious (2001)</a></em>, by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobCohen">Rob Cohen</a> goes to show the depth of insight a director can have about hidden aspects of the movie. Oh yeah, and he likes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blow stuff up</a> too.
</li><li> Amy Heckerling and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronCrowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronCrowe">Cameron Crowe</a> have such a good time talking about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a></em> that the commentary goes on 20 minutes longer than the movie.
<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous">Almost Famous</a>,</em> Crowe brings his Mom along (as she was the inspiration for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancesMcDormand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancesMcDormand">Frances McDormand</a>'s character).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyDeVito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyDeVito">Danny DeVito</a>'s commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheRoses">The War of the Roses</a></em> is pretty standard (and quite good) except for several parts where he starts complaining about an unnamed movie composer, living near the mansion where the exterior shots were filmed, who kept calling the police and complaining about noise from the production. Each time, DeVito stops ranting after a few seconds and apologizes to the audience.
</li><li> Each movie of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> saga has a commentary track by George Lucas and heads of the principal production departments. They mostly discussed common knowledge facts. To the contrary, the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> movie was much more informative, as the whole thing was rather fresh and new at the time. Movies released after Lucasfilm's purchase by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> also have commentaries, recorded without Lucas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em> has four commentaries, the most interesting of which is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckPalahniuk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckPalahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a> and screenwriter Jim Uhls. It's a masterclass in how to adapt a novel.
<ul><li> The track featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton">Edward Norton</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher">David Fincher</a> together in a room is highly amusing, as the actors frequently gang up on the director for laughs but also respect his craft and the info he wants to share. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter">Helena Bonham-Carter</a> is dropped in via solo clips, some of which have priceless anecdotal information. Most notably, the very English HBC had <strong>no idea</strong> how old American children are in grade school, so the "I haven't been fucked like that since grade school" line meant nothing to her when she delivered it.
</li></ul></li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em> DVD, there's an alternate commentary track by writer Toby Emmerich and his brother Noah, who appeared in a small role. Toby openly questions who's listening to the commentary and gives his email address (which became more useful once he became the head of New Line) and Noah has to leave midway through the commentary to get to another appointment.
</li><li> The Region 1 DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2000">Godzilla 2000</a></em> features a commentary by the three guys who did most of the work Americanizing the film. It's full of information on what goes on in dubbing and adapting a film and is hilarious to boot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> has several commentaries, including one of two actual police officers from Wells, Somerset (where it was filmed).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">Shaun of the Dead</a></em> features numerous commentaries, including one with zombies.
<ul><li> In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright">Edgar Wright</a> himself states on the Director's Commentary that his aim is to have "More commentary tracks than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>". If you include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced">Spaced</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScottPilgrimVsTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScottPilgrimVsTheWorld">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a></em>, he's pretty much done this.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> is known for the excellent commentaries he sets up for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheViewAskewniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheViewAskewniverse">View Askewniverse</a> films:
<ul><li> The commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries">Clerks: The Animated Series</a>,</em> essentially three hours of ranting against ABC and bad Korean animators, may be just as funny as the cartoon.
</li><li> His first commentary he ever did was for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em> laserdisc (which is also featured on the later DVD). It's notable for — aside from insights on how Smith put together a film for the price of a new car — featuring Jason "Jay" Mewes on the floor, drunk, occasionally loudly shouting an expletive before falling asleep.
</li><li> He has also done commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mallrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mallrats">Mallrats</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy">Chasing Amy</a></em> (in which he says "Fuck DVD, Laserdisc is the future"), two for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em> (once with the cast, then again when it was deemed that nothing was learnt from the first), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a></em>, two for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerseyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerseyGirl">Jersey Girl</a></em> (including one with Jason Mewes), three for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII">Clerks II</a></em> (including a podcast commentary that was intended for people to take to the cinema and listen to while the film was on release). Interestingly, he didn't do one for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackAndMiriMakeAPorno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackAndMiriMakeAPorno">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a></em>, apparently because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Smith's response to the low box office reciept</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Famously, the Extended Editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> came with four commentary tracks per movie: directors/writers, actors, production team, and design team. That's 48 hours of commentary across the whole series. To add to the greatness, the actors' commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Return of the King</a></em> includes comments from both Sméagol and Gollum. And Andy Serkis too!
<ul><li> In the commentaries featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen">Ian McKellen</a> (Gandalf) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> (Saruman) it is painfully obvious that the actors are not actually watching the film and the commentary from them is simply spliced bits from interviews.
</li><li> The commentaries from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a>, Fran Walsh, and Phillipa Boyens are fascinating, and will keep you highly entertained and informed over all 11+ hours of the extended trilogy.
</li><li> In the commentary featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood">Elijah Wood</a> (Frodo), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndySerkis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndySerkis">Andy Serkis</a> (Gollum) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanAstin">Sean Astin</a> (Sam), Sean Astin completely takes over the conversation several times to rattle on about how great the story and production values are to the point that you can hear Wood and Serkis shifting uncomfortably in the background. This is easily the weakest of the assorted commentaries. While the others are a mix of good humour and fascinating information, Wood, Serkis and Astin spend most of their time praising each others performances.
</li><li> The commentaries featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DominicMonaghan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DominicMonaghan">Dominic Monaghan</a> (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) are utterly hilarious. Especially when Billy keeps waxing lyrical about his feelings for Minas Tirith.
</li><li> Bernard Hill has a few solo sections, where he lets loose a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F Strikes</a>.
<ul><li> Also Fran Walsh jokingly threatens to give viewers of ROTK a test afterwards!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> was scaled back to one commentary track per movie, by Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens. They are as informative as they were on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, explaining the reasoning behind many of the changes made while adapting the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually">Love Actually</a></em>'s commentary gets off to a rough start — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughGrant">Hugh Grant</a> arrives late (about 10 minutes into the film) and almost immediately has to excuse himself to answer his cellphone. Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillNighy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillNighy">Bill Nighy</a> and director Richard Curtis realize that young star Thomas Sangster (who was 13 years old at the time) is legally unable to watch the movie, which is rated 15, which results in them desperately talking about something else during the scenes he's not supposed to watch. In the end it's quite a nice mix of funny/informative and mutual-admiration gushing (which is to be expected considering the writer/director and cast). It's also worth it just for Hugh Grant's snark about absent co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinFirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinFirth">Colin Firth</a>, his fake nemesis. (After Richard Curtis had commented on what a nice close-up Firth had in a love scene: "I'd just assumed you'd cut it in from one of his other movies.")
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Made" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Made">Made</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonFavreau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonFavreau">Jon Favreau</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceVaughn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceVaughn">Vince Vaughn</a> use pens to draw on the screen (hidden in a sub-title track).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarrySonnenfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarrySonnenfeld">Barry Sonnenfeld</a>'s commentary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlackII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlackII">Men in Black II</a></em> falls under the awkward self-congratulation category, in addition to Sonnenfeld seemingly having no charisma whatsoever. The commentary for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">first movie</a> is unique in that Barry and actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones">Tommy Lee Jones</a> are sitting in front of the movie <em>MST3K</em>-style, and at various points even draw on the movie to point things out. These <em>MST3K</em>-style visuals are also used in the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace">Muppets from Space</a></em> (as seen below); this was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures">Sony Pictures</a> owned the rights to all three movies.
</li><li> Conversely, Barry Sonnenfeld's commentary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetShorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetShorty">Get Shorty</a></em> along with the Making Of features reveals just how much of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">movie was made exactly how</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">the movie in the movie</a> was made, especially how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyDeVito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyDeVito">Danny DeVito</a></em> was basically playing himself.
<ul><li> He bought the rights to the movie before actually reading it, just like Chili Palmer in the book/film.
</li><li> He was originally going to play the role of Chili Palmer, but he and other producers thought he'd be too short for the role, which is the ending punch line of the movie!
</li><li> He was asked a question in the Making Of interviews and starts rambling in an arrogant way and then admits that he forgot what the original question was, totally as his character Martin Weir would do.
</li><li> He and other actors admit to ordering totally off menu and not knowing their own address just like Martin Weir.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace">Muppets from Space</a></em> had the director joined by Gonzo and Rizzo, which resulted in an amusing joke commentary that's largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a> stuff — clean, but most of their references would be missed by kids.
</li><li> The screenwriters' commentary track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum">Night at the Museum</a></em> is just hilarious. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">It</a>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">magic</a>".
<ul><li> Their commentary for the second one is just as good.
</li></ul></li><li> The actor's commentary track on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven">Ocean's Eleven</a></em>. If watching the movie didn't make it obvious that the cast had an absolute ball making the film, hearing them riff on the movie and each other does.
</li><li> The colorized DVD release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness">Reefer Madness</a></em> has two commentaries. One is by the colorization team, which combines fascinating insights into the colorization process with lame pot jokes. The other is by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mike Nelson</a>.
<ul><li> Nelson has recorded commentary tracks for other classic movie DVD titles, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959">House on Haunted Hill (1959)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></em>. These commentaries combine both classic "trivia spouting" and Nelson's own milieu — movie-bashing a la <em>MST3K</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> Deluxe Edition, director Paul W.S. Anderson and actresses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleRodriguez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleRodriguez">Michelle Rodriguez</a> crack jokes and argue about meaningless crap.
<div class="indent"><strong>Anderson</strong>: And in this scene we... <br/><strong>Milla</strong>: Who cares about that, you can see my boobs! Look!
</div><ul><li> It continues in a similar fashion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilApocalypse">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich">Milla Jovovich</a>, Oded Fehr, and Sienna Guillory. The problem is that Milla and Oded clearly recorded their commentary separate from Sienna and the two were spliced together to alternate between them, causing major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> from hearing happy joking Milla and Oded to hearing down to earth and serious-about-her-job Sienna.
</li></ul></li><li> "Comedian" <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrotTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrotTop">Carrot Top</a> has a commentary track on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRulesOfAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRulesOfAttraction">The Rules of Attraction</a></em> in which he watches the film for the first time. He keeps making inappropriate jokes throughout the film... and then a woman gets drugged and raped by frat boys. The sheer bizarreness of listening to him try to backpedal on his statements is gold. Also notable is the fact that the DVD packaging tries to keep this a surprise: The list of special features includes "Bonus commentary by a MYSTERY GUEST!", with the text being accompanied by a small carrot icon as the only hint.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em> has an in-character commentary with Lemony Snicket berating the director for making him sit through such a miserable movie. (After watching it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">you may agree with him</a>.)
<ul><li> Lemony Snicket goes through the entire thing acting as if the things had actually happened, and that Count Olaf, the main villain, is playing himself, having kidnapped Jim Carrey and locked him away somewhere.
</li><li> On the other hand, it's worth watching for this commentary alone, said commentary containing not a few instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">Funny Moments</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">This is Spın̈al Tap</a></em> has had several commentaries. For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CriterionCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CriterionCollection">Criterion Collection</a> edition, it's played straight, with the cast and director talking about how the filmed the movie. For another special edition, the cast performs a commentary in character. It's hilarious. They protest at how stupid they were made to look by the director.
<ul><li> And point out the "key turning point" of the film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Twenty-five times</a>.
</li><li> Apparently every single person in the film besides the band themselves has died by the time the commentary is made. A few times the person making this claim is challenged on how they know that, and the gag is even extended to when they visit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s grave.
</li></ul></li><li> The director's commentaries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenSommers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenSommers">Stephen Sommers</a>'s films, featuring writer/director Sommers and producer/editor Bob Duscay, are just as entertaining as the movies themselves, with both either elaborating on the movie or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">admitting</a> that things don't quite work that way in real life.
<ul><li> The special edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999">The Mummy</a></em> has two additional commentaries: one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser">Brendan Fraser</a> (Rick O'Connell) by himself, and another with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OdedFehr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OdedFehr">Oded Fehr</a> (Ardeth Bay), Kevin J. O'Connor (Beni), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldVosloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldVosloo">Arnold Vosloo</a> (Imhotep). Given that Vosloo speaks no English during the film itself, hearing his natural voice and accent is interesting in its own right.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a>'s commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> gives many reasons as to why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">some things were different</a> in the movie as well as elaborating on the backstory. He's also fairly knowledgeable about the mythos of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a>,</em> save for his mistakenly calling Scorponok "Scorponox".
<ul><li> Bay's commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadBoys">Bad Boys</a></em> is also especially fascinating. He doesn't pull any punches when talking about the hardships faced during the production.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder">Tropic Thunder</a></em>: In-universe, the extreme method actor Kirk Lazarus is known for getting deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">Lost in Character</a> with every role he plays, and says at one point that he <em>never</em> breaks character until after he's finished recording the DVD commentary. True to his word, in the real-life DVD commentary for <em>Tropic Thunder</em> itself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> does his commentary in-character as Kirk Lazarus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">in-character as Lincoln Osiris</a></em>. When the aforementioned line in the movie comes up, he breaks character. No, not Downey, <em>Lazarus</em> breaks character and continues the commentary as himself. When Movie!Lazarus has an identity crisis and breaks character near the end of the movie is when Downey finally breaks character in the commentary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UHF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UHF">UHF</a></em> has a rather bizarre one, with minor cast members wandering in and out at various times. Most notably when Emo Phillips' scenes are on Weird Al wonders whatever happened to the guy only to hear "I'm right behind you". Al also calls Victoria Jackson on the phone during the recording (which she clearly wasn't expecting), and appears on screen a couple of times, once to simply leave and get a snack for the director.
</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> movie had three members of the production crew pose as three famous heroes of D&amp;D lore, giving in-character comments about the plot and pointing out references to common D&amp;D concepts. Better than it sounds, partly because it's genuinely unique and interesting, and partly because it includes a sizable about of jokey heckling, somewhat reminiscent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax">RiffTrax</a> audio stream.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGamers">The Gamers</a></em> contains two notable commentaries: one is by RPG designer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Monte Cook</a>, the other is a psychoanalysis of its events, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">backstabbing someone with a ballista</a>.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects">The Usual Suspects</a></em> is played straight until the final scenes, when director Singer and screenwriter McQuarrie suddenly engage in a heated argument. Portions of the argument fade in and out of the commentary track much like the dialogue of the film's climax. The filmmakers each land a parting insult before the track ends.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em> is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaQuinn">Patricia Quinn</a> (Magenta) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardOBrien">Richard O'Brien</a> (Riff-Raff) and is both informative and rather humorous.

What is that extra bit between your knickers and your stockings? <br/><strong>Patricia Quinn</strong> (As Magenta): (Laughs) I have no idea. Oh, I don't know....
</div><ul><li> It also includes a track recorded at a live screening of the film, featuring audience participation callbacks. However, it was made for/taken from the 1995 laserdisc, and thus has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">Unintentional Period Piece</a> callbacks referencing then-current events like the O.J.

Bugs and Daffy came back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction">Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a>'s standup DVDs all contain commentaries, but since he tends to forget his material after he's stopped using it, and doesn't watch the discs before recording them, they consist mostly of him laughing at his own jokes.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest">Mommie Dearest</a></em> is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters">John Waters</a>, as he's a fan of the film and doesn't consider it all that campy. He actually makes some very interesting points while managing to be totally hilarious.
</li><li> Joel and Ethan Coen typically avoid commentary tracks, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodSimple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodSimple">Blood Simple</a></em> has one by fictional artistic director Kenneth Loring, written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers">The Coen Brothers</a> themselves, that essentially spoofs commentary tracks themselves. Loring generally alternates between waxing rhapsodic about the framing of certain shots ("the human face... we all... have one"), telling rambling off-topic stories, and offering up spurious details on how certain effects were accomplished (he claims a scene where two characters are driving in the rain at night had to be filmed in reverse with the actors hanging upside down — the fact that their hair doesn't appear to be standing up is attributed to copious amounts of hair spray).
</li><li> Stand-up Tim Vine's first DVD had a commentary that not only provided some really interesting insights into the creative process, but that he used as an opportunity to tell some jokes that he forgot to include in the performance itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon">Armageddon</a></em> has a surprisingly delightful one where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a> spends a good portion of the time riffing on and poking holes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">logic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">of his own movie</a>.

</div></li><li> The best part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> on DVD is listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">Robert Pattinson</a>'s thinly disguised hatred for Edward Cullen. <em>Eclipse</em> furthers this when he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart">Kristen Stewart</a> repeatedly mock everything about it. It's implied that they're both high in order to cope with watching the movie.
</li><li> For the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superbad">Superbad</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddApatow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddApatow">Judd Apatow</a> brought his 10 year old daughter to the recording of the commentary, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonahHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonahHill">Jonah Hill</a> in the same room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethRogen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethRogen">Seth Rogen</a>, in another studio via audio uplink, taunts Jonah by running his mouth off for as long as possible. Jonah loses it and goes on a rant about why Judd brought a 10 year old girl to the commentary of such a dirty movie. Judd then storms out and isn't heard from again. It's unclear how much of this was staged.
<ul><li> Later on, Jonah says Judd's daughter is still in the studio. Whether this is true or not is unclear.
</li><li> Also, they'd tell stories about what happened on the set. One particularly amusing tale is about when they were shooting a scene and an old lady wandered on set and began telling dirty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> jokes.
<ul><li> "What's red and has 7 bumps in it?"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are a couple of commentaries for the first movie, but the one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">Keira Knightley</a> and Jack Davenport (more of the former than the latter) is hilarious. Sadly it's only on selected scenes and not the entire movie.
</li><li> The one with Keira and Davenport is rather priceless for the moment where he realizes he didn't understand a significant plot point: He's stunned to find out that when the water ripples when Elizabeth faints and falls into the ocean, that the medallion is "calling" to the Black Pearl and it's what makes it appear later.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Keira</strong>: What exactly did you think it was? <br/><strong>Jack</strong>: I thought the film skipped!
</div></li><li> "Oh, mini-me! Mini-me! Mini-Orlando! Look at that cleavage!" A particularly amusing exchange happens when Elizabeth is running from the pirates in the governer's mansion; Keira Knightley explains that a shot showing her running up stairs practically killed her because she wasn't prepared, having expected her stunt double to do it. After Jack Davenport incredulously asks "You need a <em>stunt girl</em> to run up some stairs," she responds, in an extremely posh voice, "Yes, <em>excuse me, yes,</em> I am <em>extremely</em> lazy!"
</li><li> Given how Davenport laments his (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust">sexy, sexy</a>) very ornate Naval costumes and how much more fun all the scruffy pirates were having, one wonders, given his character's rather extreme make-under in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></em>, if the writers were listening.
</li><li> During the scene where character Norrington is made a Commodore of the British Navy, Davenport comments "how can one man be wearing that much brocade and <em>not</em> be classified as a Mardi Gras float?"
</li><li> He then laments losing so much screen time to better-looking actors. One particular scene required some complicated ceremonial swordwork. "I practiced for weeks with that, and I'm in the background of <em>your shot!"</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></em>: The commentary by the writers included their noting the bone-cage chase on the cannibal island and the three-way sword fight on a giant wheel caused them to ask the director "Did you get your kids a hamster for Christmas?" They also go into a fair amount of self-deprecation, explaining the symbolism behind certain scenes only to say, "Oh, c'mon, you know no one uses literary devices in these summer blockbusters..."
</li></ul></li><li> Listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a>'s commentary on any of his movies is a truly fascinating experience, it gives you an inside look as to how utterly ridiculous he truly is. Some highlights:
<ul><li> Unironically claiming to be trying to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism">German Expressionism</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a></em> ("Az you can see zis shot is very reminiscent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinetOfDrCaligari">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a></em>")
</li><li> Going on a rant about Tara Reid's refusal to show her breasts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005">Alone in the Dark (2005)</a></em>, all but <em>blaming the movie's failure on this</em>.
</li><li> Boll getting more worked up about a <em>cheeseburger</em> arriving than anything about the movie in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarCry">Far Cry</a></em> commentary.
</li><li> And finally his commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodrayneIIDeliverance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodrayneIIDeliverance">BloodRayne II: Deliverance</a></em> where he inexplicably <em>stops</em> halfway through the movie, with the remaining half of the track being the sounds of <em>an empty room</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CastAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CastAway">Cast Away</a></em> is dominated by the sound mixer's commentary on sound effects during the most pivotal scenes of the movie — most notably as he gets off the island. While some of the commentary is interesting, you would think by listening that the sound effects were the absolute centerpoint of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepBrothers">Step Brothers</a></em> features a musical commentary, with the actors and writers all spontaneously breaking into improvisational songs at random periods throughout the movie, accompanied by the movie's composer on keyboard. This is notable because the movie itself is <strong>not</strong> a musical, although it is largely improvisational.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> includes a commentary track in the most literal sense. While most blind people are familiar with a commentary track <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AudioDescription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AudioDescription">describing the action onscreen allowing them to "watch" a movie</a>, back then, those tracks were not typically included on wide-release videos and DVD. <em>Daredevil</em> includes the commentary track for the blind — fitting, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> is a blind superhero — which explains the actions onscreen as they happen.
<ul><li> It's an interesting experience to "watch" the movie with your eyes closed and that commentary on to get a feel for how the blind see movies.
</li><li> There's also a funny moment when director Mark Steven Johnson openly admits that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">an effect looks terrible</a>—towards the end when Daredevil awkwardly leaps upwards between two buildings onto a roof—and tells the audience to look away for thirty seconds and then come back.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks">Mars Attacks!</a></em> DVD is a strange case whether you want to hear the commentary in English or in Martian! ("AK AK AK AK!")
<ul><li> The same joke is done for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em>.
</li><li> Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> doesn't give good commentary.
</li><li> Indeed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s comments for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> are punctuated with a lot of rambling thoughts and giggles — but some insight.
</li><li> In his commentary for the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman</a></em> film he says "you know" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">probably a hundred times</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em> commentary is pretty impressive, considering it was recorded ten years after the movie was made and director Frank Darabont is able to name off many trivial facts and details, down to names of crew members, about the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em> has a quite interesting track by Sylvester Stallone, covering tidbits about the shoot and philosophical pondering on the characters in pretty much equal measure.
</li><li> The DVD commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedEye">Red Eye</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven">Wes Craven</a> giving out more background information, such as Rippner's complex mindset and the strange, underlying chemistry between Rippner and Lisa. Another good mention is the many extra cameos were people who worked on the film. And yes, Craven confirms that when Lisa got the scar, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was raped.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">Predator</a></em> has a terrible commentary from director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMcTiernan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMcTiernan">John McTiernan</a> that is nothing short of a chore to sit through. McTiernan sounds utterly disinterested, muttering his way through the film, audibly sighing and lapsing into long periods of silence. It's a shame, as some of the things he manages to bring himself to say are actually fairly interesting.
<ul><li> McTiernan delivers an equally boring commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall (1990)</a></em>: The one for this film is particularly hilarious. For one, Verhoeven's Dutch accent, coupled with Schwarzenegger's Austrian accent, serve to make it almost unintelligible. Schwarzenegger's commentary consists almost entirely of making jokes about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiboobage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multiboobage">three-breasted hooker</a>, a grating tendency for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">stating the patently obvious</a> ("This is me as a construction worker", "I used this guy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a> and then threw him down the escalator"), and expressing how he likes certain parts of the movie because they serve to reinforce the possibility that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>. Verhoeven for his part has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a> that leads him to end most of his sentences with "Izznit?", though it's possible he's just trying to get Arnold to contribute more, who seems to respond with "Exactly", the occasional "That's right", or complete silence to pretty much everything Verhoeven says.
<ul><li> Verhoeven says "Izznit?" when he's alone in interviews so often it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">verbal tic</a>. Just like Tony Scott saying "Yeah" on commentaries of his movies.
</li></ul></li><li> As a rule, any commentary track Paul Verhoeven does is worth listening to if you can understand him through his accent. He's an extremely smart man and generally has a lot of interesting things to talk about.
</li><li> The Criterion Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a></em> has several commentary tracks, including one <em>by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> himself</em> that makes the CE a must-have for Thompson fans. Throughout the film Hunter insults <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryGilliam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryGilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>, screams randomly, audibly smokes weed, and tries to call cast members when he's bored. Yet for all his randomness, he remembers that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> is using audio from the anti-drug law enforcement movie-in-a-movie on his answering machine and calls Depp's answering machine to prove it — and Hunter times it almost perfectly to sync up the film and the machine.
</li><li> The Criterion laserdisc editions of the first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movies reportedly feature commentary so controversial they have since been banned from ever getting the rights to release any <em>Bond</em> movie ever released. Forever.
<ul><li> Most of the commentaries that do appear, especially the older Bond movies, are audio clips from past interviews introduced by someone from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming">Ian Fleming</a> Foundation. The "Ultimate Edition" release in 2006 allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore">Roger Moore</a> to do a solo track in all his movies - and while he at times digresses to talk about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint">The Saint</a></em> or his UNICEF work, it's somehow fairly detailed for a man reaching his eighties!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em> featured not only a commentary with director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinCampbell">Martin Campbell</a> and producer Michael G. Wilson, but in the extras disk, Campbell offers comments in parts of a documentary - namely, the director of photography questioning why the producers hired a New Zealander "given how all they know is sheep! <em>Baaaaa</em>ction! (saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">the DP's a long time collaborator of his</a>) and scenes from a Monaco shoot where Campbell drops a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> (the day had been so busy he couldn't help it).
</li></ul></li><li> The commentary for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich">Roland Emmerich</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfterTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfterTomorrow">The Day After Tomorrow</a></em> features Roland himself and (mostly) producer Mark Gordon, who spends 88% of the commentary complaining about the difficulties of production, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">pointing out plot holes, and making fun of the acting</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotelRwanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotelRwanda">Hotel Rwanda</a></em> has a fascinating one with Paul Rusesabagina, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">the real life subject of the film</a>, who gives further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> on the events and points out historical liberties. The film's director Terry George is also there, but he's clearly comfortable just letting Rusesabagina tell his story and acts like more of an interviewer for the most part.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathAtAFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathAtAFuneral">Death at a Funeral</a></em> has two commentaries, one with actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanTudyk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanTudyk">Alan Tudyk</a> and Andy Nyman with writer Dean Craig, and one with director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankOz">Frank Oz</a>. If you've ever wanted to hear a film commentated on by Fozzie the Bear, the second commentary is surprisingly close.
</li><li> The director's commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaked">Freaked</a></em> manages to combine hilarious and informative by telling stories of being on the set (such has having to get a "scab T" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT">Mr. T</a> left shooting for a day as he felt the shoot was going too slow) to the constant interference that the directors suffered from Fox. Even after all of the difficulties, they were still proud of their baby.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em> movie is worth a rental just for Akiva Goldsman's comments over the end credits, where he gleefully discusses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">his plans for the sequel</a>. It sounds like he was saving all his best ideas for it, making this a textbook example of why that's a bad idea.
</li><li> The DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteOleander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteOleander">White Oleander</a></em> has an interesting commentary with the director of the film and the author of the novel it's based on, leading to interesting tidbits for fans of the book as well as those who had only seen the film.
</li><li> The audio commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em> is done by the film's two lead actors, David Naughton and Griffin Dunne. It has some funny moments, but other than that mostly has one asking the other "Do you remember filming this scene?", interspersed by long silences.
</li><li> In the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> they have an ongoing joke about "Future Movies Magazine" talking about how great movies they are working on but haven't been released yet will be. When "Man or a Muppet?" starts, they joke about it getting an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> — one even says "Yeah, in <em>Future Movies Magazine</em>". "Man or a Muppet" did indeed eventually win the Academy Award for Best Song.

(But it was <em>very</em> nice wallpaper.)
</li><li> One of the two commentaries of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13">Apollo 13</a></em> is by Jim and Marylin Lovell — Jim Lovell is the author of <em>Lost Moon</em>, the book the film was based on and, oh yeah — was the <em>commander</em> of Apollo 13. His wife doesn't say a lot, but Jim talks about the differences between the movie and the events, and the similarities. If you are a space nerd, the commentary really makes you feel like a witness to history.
</li><li> On the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher">David Fincher</a> basically gives a film school masterclass, and at one point tells viewers to take it up with writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> if they have complaints about a certain scene, and provides the latter's email address (which is bleeped out).

There's also talk of Fong's magic skills (which are demonstrated in a featurette elsewhere on the disc), and he promises to bend the silverware in the house of anyone listening to the commentary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BubbaHoTep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BubbaHoTep">Bubba Ho Tep</a></em> has an amusing one featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a> as Elvis, commenting about his thoughts on the film, completely in character.

</li><li> At one point during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4">Scream 4</a></em> commentary track with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaRoberts">Emma Roberts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> (who has to leave two-thirds of the way through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mirroring her role in the film itself</span>), Neve Campbell (via phone from London, and another one who doesn't stay to the end — she only takes part for half an hour from around the 15-minute mark) and director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven">Wes Craven</a>, Hayden realises her shirt's on the wrong way around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">promptly takes it off to put it on properly</a>, much to Miss Roberts's amusement and Mr. Craven's bemusement bordering on blushing. As with the film, Panettiere is therefore the best part of the track.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insomnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insomnia">Insomnia</a></em> is a rather odd case. While it does have a usual commentary track by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a>, scene-specific commentaries are made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilarySwank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilarySwank">Hilary Swank</a>, screenwriter Hillary Seitz, director of photography Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, and editor Dody Dorn. Of course, the option can be made to listen to the tracks combined for a more traditional listening experience.
</li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zardoz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zardoz">Zardoz</a></em> is particularly interesting in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoorman">John Boorman</a> not only admits large parts of the film are unnecessary, but openly admits the movie was made on drugs.

</li><li> In addition to a creator commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em>, there is a "Crook and Cop" commentary, which feature Henry Hill (the ex-gangster whom the film is based on) and the prosecutor who used Henry as a witness in mob cases and put him into witness protection. The pair provide an insight into what the gangsters were like in real life.
</li><li> In the Blu-ray of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>, the film stops to have the actors discuss certain scenes on screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> has a commentary by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWise">Robert Wise</a>, in which he stops talking during musical numbers to play what the song sounds like sans vocals.
</li><li> The commentary for the incredibly forgettable 2005 monster movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCave">The Cave</a></em> is a study in listening to screenwriters come <em>this</em> close to bitching about the shitty movie someone made out of their script but then backing off just in time to save their livelihoods.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WestSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WestSideStory">West Side Story</a></em> 50th anniversary Blu-Ray has lyricist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> provide commentary for the musical numbers, discussing abandoned concepts, differences between the play and the movie, and which songs he does and doesn't feel proud of in retrospect.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s sparse commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdwardScissorhands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdwardScissorhands">Edward Scissorhands</a></em> is of the "there's so little talking I don't even know if the commentary is on" variety, with little more than a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">amusing interjections</a>.
<dl><dd><div class="indent">"Does anyone really understand bowling?"

</li><li> As the commentary track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thirteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thirteen">13</a></em> features then-teenaged actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvanRachelWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvanRachelWood">Evan Rachel Wood</a>, Nikki Reed,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ne2s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ne2s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ne2s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who also co-wrote the film and whom Wood's character was based on</span> and Brady Corbet, as well as Catherine Hardwicke in her directorial debut, its tone drifts between serious discussion and an almost slumber party-esque atmosphere. Among the highlights:
<ul><li> When Evan describes - matter-of-factly and at some length - how for one scene her makeup artist had purposely done her lipstick in a way that made it look like she had just performed the sex act that had been implied between scenes, the others are noticeably uncomfortable. Brady giggles nervously, Catherine seems unsure of whether to change the subject, and Nikki reacts with an, "Umm... thanks for sharing!"
</li><li> The botched navel piercing scene is revealed to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a> - Nikki accidentally cut Evan with the piercing, who notes that her subsequent F-bomb was <em>not</em> in the script but because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">I was experiencing intense pain!</a>"
</li><li> Nikki Reed had objected to a scene requiring her to shimmy a tube top down into a makeshift (and rather short) skirt. When it was pointed out that she had in fact written that scene, she replied, "Well, I thought I was writing it for someone else!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1l4eu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1l4eu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1l4eu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Initially, it had been thought that Nikki would play Tracy; she was recast as Evie when Evan Rachel Wood joined the film.</span>
</li><li> One of the actresses mentions how their advocate<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fzbc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fzbc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fzbc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">someone on set to ensure the film adhered to rules for the protection of child actors</span> had misheard the lyrics "I feel like humpin' something" as the much more uplifting "I feel like hope is something"... and the perverse pleasure they took in correcting her.
</li></ul></li><li> The commentary track of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Krull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Krull">Krull</a></em> consists mostly of the crew making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">excuses</a> about the special effects and the cast name dropping famous people they've worked with in other films.
</li><li> The audio commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em> has the drawbacks of a solo commentary, as it's done by Mel Brooks alone, but is otherwise quite good. One thing that makes it notable is that Ronny Graham is there with Brooks - though you mostly have to take Brooks' word for it, as Graham is completely silent save for a giggle when Brooks introduces him and a brief remark near the film's end.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs each have two commentaries: A Q&amp;A with director/co-writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> and co-producer/co-writer Bob Gale answering questions from fans, and a screen-specific commentary with producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton.
</li><li> Almost all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em> movies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> onward each have a director's commentary on their DVDs and/or Blu-Ray Discs, which sometimes also features comments from other crew members and/or an actor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> began including commentary tracks with its films beginning with the 2001-05 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">Special Edition</a> releases.
<ul><li> Most of the Special Edition releases featured commentary from the directors of each film, usually with additional members of that film's production. The two exceptions are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Generations</a></em>, whose commentary was done by the film's writers, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Insurrection</a></em>, which received no audio commentary whatsoever.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay">Blu-ray</a> releases and their corresponding DVD reissues feature commentary tracks newly recorded for those releases. The Blu-rays also include the Special Edition commentaries, except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> (whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Director's Edition</a> commentary was specific to that version of the film) and the aforementioned <em>Insurrection</em>; both films only had the new commentary recorded for the Blu-ray edition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em> has "enhanced" commentary, which was originally an iTunes exclusive, later included on the "Compendium" box set of the first two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a> <em>Star Trek</em> films.
</li></ul></li><li> The director commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Equilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Equilibrium">Equilibrium</a></em> was primarily just a very long apology from writer and director Kurt Wimmer, apologizing for the various things that they had to cut corners on for bugetary reasons, and generally discribing the superior film that could have been made had they been given enough time and money.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> has made commentary tracks for most of his films, which tend to be very entertaining. The ones with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell">Kurt Russell</a> in particular are clearly two good friends reminiscing and catching up.
</li><li> The commentary with Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em> is probably one of the most disappointing ever. Davis spends most of the time simply talking about shooting locations and praising ever actor on screen while Jones' is quiet most of the time and when he does speak his comments amount to things like "I liked this part" and "it was cold that day".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SolomonKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SolomonKane">Solomon Kane</a></em> has a fun one with the director Michael J. Bassett and James Purefoy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986">The Fly (1986)</a></em> found an interesting way to split the difference when it came to bonus features — director/co-writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> provides a lively solo commentary track. Then the feature-length (as in <em>longer than the movie</em>) retrospective documentary <em>Fear of the Flesh</em> features just about all of the film's <strong>other</strong> major participants — the three lead actors, the other writer, the producer, the production designer, the effects crew, the cinematographer, the director <em>originally</em> attached to the project, etc. — to give their sides of the story of its production, with optional extended segments featuring tangential anecdotes.
</li><li> <em>Beyond Suspicion</em> (aka <em>Auggie Rose</em>) is a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffGoldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a> drama from 2000 that went direct-to-cable in the United States, but it is also one of the only films he's ever participated in a DVD commentary for<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33y57');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note33y57" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33y57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the other, almost 20 years later, is the Criterion Collection version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrandBudapestHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrandBudapestHotel">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a></em></span> with director-writer Matthew Tabak (who also provides a second track with the film's producer). As one might expect from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">famously quirky</a> Goldblum, there's not a quiet moment as he makes many whimsical digressions (such as briefly discussing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleMrLimpet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleMrLimpet">The Incredible Mr. Limpet</a></em>, which was one of his favorite films as a kid) and jokes, but guided by Tabak he also discusses his typical preparations for a role, how he gets into the right frame of mind for individual scenes when they're being shot out of sequence, how his acting has evolved over the years from fairly straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethodActing">Method Acting</a> to a more improvisational style, and his experiences teaching the craft to others in Los Angeles, along with anecdotes about this film's production and themes. They also joke that anyone who stays through to the end of the commentary is eligible to have dinner at Jeff's house.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cats">Cats</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">already one of the most bizarre movies ever to be put out in wide release by a major studio,</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/cats-is-a-medieval-morality-play-20-highlights-from-to-1842387249">has a director's commentary by Tom Hooper that only adds to the weirdness.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Though clearly hogtied to some extent by the show's lawyers (without reading her recaps you'd get the feeling Erin is far more fond of season three than she really is) it's still good fun as they easily find things to chat about through the whole episode and even get in the odd jab at the show ("What was the point of the dress?").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s commentaries for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> episodes are occasionally enlightening, but always funny. His commentary for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FireflyE14ObjectsInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FireflyE14ObjectsInSpace">Objects in Space</a>", however, is very philosophical, as the episode was inspired by the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre. His commentary on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E22Restless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E22Restless">Restless</a>" is almost required to actually understand what the hell is going on.

<ul><li> This one also features Tudyk speculating on what Wash was up to during the Unification War: spending most of it in prison after getting shot down on his first mission ferrying supplies (though for which side is up for grabs), and surviving in prison by entertaining fellow prisoners with shadow puppets (apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in the <em>Firefly</em>-verse).

</li><li> Jane Espensen recorded commentary for some of the episodes she wrote for in <em>Buffy</em> season 3, which provide a decent insight into the production process and what it was like to write each episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowRunner">alongside Joss Whedon</a>.

<ul><li> The classic series home video team aim to get commentaries recorded by surviving cast and crew for DVD releases of <em>every</em> surviving serial; as of 2020, the only released serials that have no commentary are "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E3TheEdgeOfDestruction">The Edge of Destruction</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear">The Web of Fear</a>".

Otherwise, the entire serial is commentated.
<ul><li> Rereleases occasionally come with a new second commentary. For example, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E5TheRobotsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E5TheRobotsOfDeath">The Robots of Death</a>" was first released in 2000 with a commentary featuring producer Philip Hinchcliffe and writer Chris Boucher.

</li><li> Many classic <em>Who</em> commentaries do like to playfully mock the episodes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a> has said that he prefers doing the commentaries with the actors, and not members of the production staff, as the actors are usually more willing to take playful jabs at the silliness of it all (although some fans get very upset about the negativity of Davison's remarks about some stories, and even more so Janet Fielding's).
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie">TV movie</a> had two commentaries. The first featured a straightforward commentary from director Geoffrey Sax about the casting, filming, and special effects shots. The second was moderated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs">Nicholas Briggs</a>, and featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulMcGann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulMcGann">Paul McGann</a> talking about how much fun they had during filming, gushing about co-star Daphne Ashbrook, and making fun of the movie's sillier moments.
</li><li> With regards to the revival series box sets, Series 1-4 had cast and/or crew commentaries for every episode. The post-Series 4 specials had to go without. From Series 5 onwards, only a handful of episodes/specials from each season get commentaries. Sometimes the choices of which episodes get them and which don't are odd; from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>'s tenure, fan punching bags "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon">Kill the Moon</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E9SleepNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E9SleepNoMore">Sleep No More</a>" received commentaries, but not his massively-scaled multi-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finales</a>!
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em> DVD includes on average of two and a half commentaries <em>per episode</em>, including one done by three "teachers" in character and one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">posters on the biggest F&amp;G fanboard</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddApatow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddApatow">Judd Apatow</a> and Paul Feig freely admit that they made the occasion of recording commentaries a de facto cast reunion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em> all the seasons have at least 2/3 of the episodes have commentary by the creators, writers, actors, and in Season 1 &amp; 2 even network execs. They reveal just how off-the-wall both the writing and acting staff where, even going so far as to revealing who was sleeping with who, as well as admitting to chain smoking, drinking and even doing drugs (Andy Dick) on set.
</li><li> The commentary track for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace">Garth Marenghis Darkplace</a></em> was done by the three main stars of the show: Garth Marenghi, Dean Learner and Todd Rivers. While Garth and Dean are intensely knowledgeable and passionate about the show, it quickly becomes obvious that Todd has never actually watched the finished project before and only has a vague recollection of the scenes that he was in due to his rampant alcoholism at the time of filming. Thus, Todd has little interest in what's going on and constantly draws attention to the various flaws of the show. Meanwhile, all three men (loudly) eat crisps and drink beer while they comment. Additionally, "Todd" makes Richard Aoyade crack up for real by proposing a line of make-up for black women called Ethnic Cleansing.
</li><li> The commentary tracks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> were filmed during breaks in the filming of the show proper and released on the internet as the episodes aired. Consequently, the lineup sometimes changes halfway through an episode as the actors arrive on set or leave to shoot a scene, and the commentators occasionally have to be shushed — or even bleeped — when they accidentally start talking about an episode later in the season.
<ul><li> The shushing/bleeping is especially frustrating for owners who saw the series first on the DVD set and were unaware, because they're listening to actors being shushed on plot points and are thinking to themselves "But what sort of idiot listens to the DVD commentary BEFORE watching the series through?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>'s commentaries feature some terminology that can be found on this very wiki, including "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hanging a lantern on it</a>." The commentary for the pilot episode stops and cuts to "making of" footage in a few places. Some wound up being only "cast &amp; crew having fun". The one for season 3's "A Tale of Two Cities" has writer Damon Lindelof and actress Elizabeth Mitchell telling little useful information and a lot of jokes — even calling it "their own <em>MST3K</em>".
<ul><li> A lighthearted Season 4 commentary between Jorge Garcia and Evangeline Lilly (Hurley and Kate) includes Lilly sheepishly asking what happens when someone needs to go to the bathroom while recording a commentary track. After the act break, she returns and laments that now she's going to be forever known as the girl with the tiny bladder.
</li></ul></li><li> In the "A Series" DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em>, turning factoids on gives you 'concealed elf banter' (which acts as commentary, and tells you stuff they didn't have time to put in the show) whenever the QI magnifying glass comes on the screen.
</li><li> Every single episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> (except for Series X) gets a DVD commentary track from the entire cast for that whole series. The exception is Series V, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles">Craig Charles</a> (who plays Lister) couldn't show up to the commentary recording for due to being ill — so instead the other actors all <em>imitate him</em> and mercilessly make fun of him while he's not there. Series V and VI also include a fan commentary on the most popular episode of each series. The one for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVBackToReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVBackToReality">Back to Reality</a>" had someone from the studio sitting in to make sure the fans didn't just quote the entire episode as it happened.
<ul><li> Series VII also features Chris Barrie commenting on episodes he doesn't appear in (his character left in episode 2 but appeared in flashbacks in two more episodes after that) and for one episode he basically complains how boring it is, and the rest of the cast agree.
</li><li> Older than DVD! A VHS boxset containing one episode from each of the first six series was released, that came with an audio CD containing creator commentaries on each of the episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em>: During the recording of first season DVD's commentaries, an earthquake apparently takes place. It's not entirely clear if it's real or not.
<ul><li> Probably not. The same thing happens in a single commentary from Season 2. More to the point, the "earthquakes" occur when Series creator Alan Spencer is about to reveal whether or not Sledge and Doreau love each other and get together, and as a result of the "quakes", never reveals said information.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, the DVD commentaries (usually featuring Aaron Sorkin, Thomas Schlamme and one of the show's stars) fall under the "awkward self-congratulation" category.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWhitestKidsUKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWhitestKidsUKnow">The Whitest Kids U' Know</a></em>'s first season DVD commentary consisted of four-fifths of the group making fun of Sam for two episodes (he was an hour late and showed up when they were starting on the third episode), talking about funny things that happened during the filming, and retelling Trevor's life story before he started sketch comedy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was a lawyer in Branson, MO with a wife and three kids</span>.
</li><li> Many of the commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow">Mr. Show</a></em> feature cast members providing ad-libbed commentary as various fictional characters, some of which appear in the episode and some of which are only tangentially related to the show.
</li><li> The DVDs for the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> features a commentary with Jason Segel (who plays Marshall) watching a Marshall-centric episode while doing a joint commentary with the writer of the episode. Eventually it devolves into both of them disrobing to their underwear in what sounds like Gay Chicken. For the third season DVD, Segel apparently demanded to have the writer do another joint commentary, for an episode the writer didn't actually have any involvement in. Segel shows up drunk, with 12 condoms. 10 condoms are left by the episode's end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeirdAlShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeirdAlShow">The Weird Al Show</a></em> had fascinating cast/crew commentaries for every episode, addressing the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> they were subjected to, among many other things. They also frequently mocked the quality of the show, in essence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MSTing">MSTing</a> their own work.
</li><li> Many of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>'s commentaries are the self-congratulatory sort, but one for the fourth episode of Day Two features gags about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> ("Is that a Daewoo?")
<ul><li> There were two hilarious commentary intros for the third season. In her commentary Mary Lynn Rajskub introduces herself as Reese Witherspoon, and later on in the season during their commentary with producer Tim Iacofano, Carlos Bernard introduces himself as playing 'Tony the Pizza Man', and James Badge Dale says he plays "Chase who delivers Chinese Food".
</li></ul></li><li> As part of a joke in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheUmbilicalBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheUmbilicalBrothers">The Umbilical Brothers</a> live show <em>Speedmouse</em>, out of nowhere commentary is heard in the theatre, stating they had no idea how to end the current joke; on the DVD it turns out that it's part of the show's actual commentary. The rest of the commentary is frequently sidetracked or interrupted by other characters from the show, and when they do provide behind-the-scenes information it's false. Several times, they claim that various imaginary props and characters were actually present in the theatre, but were digitally removed in post-production. At one point, they admit that a particular imaginary character really was just a voiceover, then claim that it was intended to be a visible CGI-animated character but all the earlier digital object removal broke the CGI budget.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood">Deadwood</a></em> has commentaries sprinkled over a number of episodes with various pairings of directors, writers, and actors. It's very interesting hearing the contrast in commentating styles among the different parties. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcShane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcShane">Ian McShane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyOlyphant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyOlyphant">Timothy Olyphant</a> are clearly at a loss, and mostly just comment on trivial things like their hair and how tall the various actresses are. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyParker">Molly Parker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaGunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaGunn">Anna Gunn</a>, on the other hand, provide a rather intellectual analysis of the show's themes and characters.
</li><li> The shortlived <em>Director's Commentary</em> TV series was a rather good parody of the genre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a>'s stand-up DVD <em>Sexie</em> has a commentary, immediately lampshaded by im referring to it as an "audio commentary for an audio commentary". So.. yeah.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> did commentaries for several pivotal episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, including every season finale. Lots of great information about the production and his writing strategy, and it ultimately becomes very moving when he audibly chokes back tears while watching the series finale.
<ul><li> In addition, many of the cast member commentaries are hilarious, full of affectionate jabs at each other (particularly when Bruce Boxleitner and Jerry Doyle are involved). But the funniest moment of all is the one in "Interludes and Examinations" where Boxleitner apparently realises for the first time ever while doing the commentary <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the apparition of Sheridan's father when Kosh is killed was actually the dying Kosh talking to him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> had a commentary by Thing and Cousin Itt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> Old School: Volume 3 features a commentary on episode 1316 by Sonia Manzano.
</li><li> On the commentary for the DVD of the Australian comedy show <em>The Late Show</em> it was mentioned the possibility of some things being removed due to legal reasons. Due to his commitment and love of all things DVD, when this happens Tony Martin (cast member and producer of the DVD) cuts into the commentary track and explains what happened, and fills the blank in with jokes to ensure the commentary doesn't have any awkward pauses.
</li><li> The DVDs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GenerationKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GenerationKill">Generation Kill</a></em> have commentaries for each of the seven episodes. They range from giving insight into the making-of (with directors Susanna White and Simon Cellan Jones sitting for some episodes) to a few extra anecdotes from writer Evan Wright. The actors mostly take the commentary seriously; Stark Sands discusses the real Nate Fick and war, while in contrast Alexander Skarsgaard and James Ransone spend the fourth episode saying, "I'm not onscreen! This episode sucks."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>'s first season has a commentary for every episode, each of which include at least four people and all of which feature series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon">Dan Harmon</a>. Generally, those who accompany him are two or three of the actors (usually those whose characters had the greatest impact on that episode's plot) and occasionally the episode's writer or director.
<ul><li> For the third seasons, actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianJacobs">Gillian Jacobs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvetteNicoleBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvetteNicoleBrown">Yvette Nicole Brown</a> are the constants, with one or both appearing in every track. They also lack contributions from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldGlover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldGlover">Donald Glover</a> (who was on tour at the time) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a> (who had... issues with the production).
</li></ul></li><li> The commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em> is almost as endlessly quotable as the series themselves, due to the cast's ability to be off-the-cuff hilarious and the relaxed attitude to actually talking about the show.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill Bailey:</strong> "We will settle this... the Gypsy way." <br/>* <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced">Spaced</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em> sister show, also has a frequently laugh-out-loud commentary track, which manges to include as many as possible of the regular and guest cast, but Edgar Wright tends to pull the actors back towards relevance when they start riffing, sadly...
</div></li><li> On the commentary for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em> episode "Sister City", guest star Fred Armisen "leaves" partway through and Raul, the character he played in the episode, shows up to complain about how badly he was portrayed. Eventually, Raul "leaves", at which point Armisen just happens to "return".
</li><li> The actor commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> are always great fun. None more so than when David Hewlett's dog, Mars, sat up and growled when a Wraith came on the screen (until that point no one listening to the commentary would have known he was in the room at the time during the recording) and the time Hewlett and the others involved decided on a whim to phone a guest star in the episode they were commenting on and discuss his acting.
</li><li> Unfortunately the commentary for the DVD release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad">Police Squad!</a></em> is pretty boring — they hadn't seen the series for a while and spend more time laughing at the jokes and saying how wet behind the ears they were then letting you know anything interesting. They only offer it on three out of the total of six episodes, too — and not even the best ones. They spend half the time talking about how they had to fight against having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack">Laugh Track</a> added — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">and then their commentary is mostly... a laugh track</a>.
</li><li> Most of the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> is hilarious. Most episodes are commented by lots of the cast at the same time, and they have fun teasing each other. On one George-heavy episode the rest of the cast calls Jeffrey Tambor on the phone, and he plays along while driving until cut off in a tunnel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> features scads of commentary, with two tracks for almost every episode. The quality varies widely, though. Jon Hamm and John Slattery together are ridiculously funny, as are Christina Hendricks and Robert Morse, and Alison Brie and Vincent Kartheiser. Elizabeth Moss is a boat anchor, though, especially in the first-season commentaries, where she spends three whole episodes going on at excruciating length about how challenging and rewarding her fat suit acting was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme">Treme</a></em> has a slew of great ones by the cast and crew, plus two radio personalities who write a blog about the show's music. Plenty of information about filming in New Orleans, cultural phenomena that the show doesn't fully explain, the few historical liberties taken, and identities of locals who were given small roles. Also, David Simon says that he's written a request for a second line into his will, complete with song list, which will probably be the only one his particular cemetery will ever see.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> doesn't do many commentaries, but one tradition seems to be that Daniella Ruah (Kensi) and Eric Christian Olsen (Deeks) always do one together each season. The tracks are hilarious and if you believe their commentary then it becomes clear the writers are not stretching for the banter between the characters. Also, after the first one in Season Two, you get the feeling those two should not be allowed in the booth without a script.
</li><li> Ron Moore recorded commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> which he originally released for free as a podcast before they were included on the DVDs. They were clearly not professionally recorded and appeared to have been recorded in his house, with the sound of the neighbours mowing their lawns and telephones ringing in the background. The commentaries frequently featured cameos from his wife Terry, otherwise known as 'Mrs. Ron'.
<ul><li> Particularly amusing is his audible pleasure when Mrs. Ron is out of the house and he can therefore smoke. His scotch selection for the recording is also generally noted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> jumps back and forth between being incredibly amusing and informative as all the cast and crew riff on each other giving anecdotes, and awkward congrats sessions. In particular, creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> is such a nice man that he pretty much makes sure to congratulate everyone for everything.
</li><li> The commentaries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> are good in different ways. The commentary for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS01E01AStudyInPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS01E01AStudyInPink">A Study in Pink</a>" (Episode 1) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, and Sue Vertue (Moffat's wife and co-producer of the show) having a lengthy, informative conversation about all the various Doyle references they snuck in and what the casting process was like. The commentary for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS01E03TheGreatGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS01E03TheGreatGame">The Great Game</a>", though, is Gatiss and stars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinFreeman">Martin Freeman</a> (who hilariously, has to leave halfway through) joking around, trying not to label-drop all the excellent clothes they get to wear, and generally having a very good time.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> has plenty of good ones, the main attraction being the one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R. Martin</a> on the episode of each season he wrote himself. They also feature the showrunners/writers, directors, actors, producers, designers, etc. Lots of great notes on adaptation issues, relations between the actors, and insights into the characters. The child actors even get their own commentary, and start it off by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t92ukx0A2fk">singing along to the main theme!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale">Carnivàle</a></em> features some good ones with the actors, most notably Clea Duvall's rather embarrassed commentary on her sex scene with Nick Stahl.
</li><li> Only a few episodes in seasons one and two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> have audio commentaries and since they were recorded nine to ten years after the episodes were made, they can be characterized as remembrance style.
</li><li> The premiere episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit">Profit</a></em> features a trio of people in the booth. The track itself is pretty good, but it takes them a while to recover from the intro.

<ul><li> Season 1, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20854/wonder-showzen-season-1/">per DVD Talk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: <em>On "Space," Screamin' Steven J. Hawkins — a parody of Stephen Hawking — speaks in a computerized voice about all manner of subjects, including how since "ignorance is bliss," that means he, being the smartest person in the world, must be the most miserable. ("More misery than anyone on this God-forsaken planet could possibly understand.") Over "Diversity," the band PFFR (featuring the "Wonder Showzen" guys, and predating the TV show) plays its weird electronica music. And on "Nature," actor Dick Gregory (who plays Mr. Sun on the show) rambles amiably about ... um ... the episode, sometimes, and sometimes just about whatever. It's not as funny as the Stephen Hawking thing, but it's admirably weird... [and] one more commentary, from author Gordon Lish, who has no prior connection to "Wonder Showzen" as far as I can tell. He offers commentary on the "Patience" episode, talking more or less about the subject of patience without ever actually referencing the episode. When the episode starts playing backwards halfway through, Lish's commentary does the same thing. At the end, when the episode goes to fast-forward, so does Lish.</em>
</li><li> Season 2, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/17/wonder-showzen-season-two?page=2">per IGN<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: <em>The commentaries once again have hardly anything to do with the show itself. Rather, the episode "Genocide" has "Screamin' Stephen Hawking" and Samantha Power, a real Pulitzer-Prize winning author. And "Time" has a professor of theoretical physics from the City University of New York. Both professors simply lecture on their subject for a half-hour. To be honest, these commentaries are amazingly interesting and worth a listen. Watching the show play as the professor talk about their work is a fascinating bit of art.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The season 2 DVD for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey">Gavin &amp; Stacey</a></em> has in-vision commentaries on all six episodes. This at least proves that most of the cast members were present, even if some of them go whole episodes without saying anything. We also get to see their delight when a lackey turns up with drinks for them.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a> did this for all of their albums (save <em>Licensed to Ill</em> and their two newest albums) to celebrate their special-edition reissues throughout 2009.
</li><li> Kill Hannah did this for two albums <em>Until There's Nothing Left Of Us</em> and <em>Wake Up The Sleepers</em>, making them available with pre-order. (The latter, in addition to specifying the many special guests of the album, originally told the listeners <em>exactly</em> what sort of drug binge the lead singer was on to inspire the album's first single. His exhortation never to do that particular drug is rather less effective now that the commentary's been censored.)
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Trifonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Trifonic">Trifonic</a> included a 30-minute commentary track for their debut album <em>Emergence</em> as a hidden track, when purchased as a download from their online store.
</li><li> The 25th anniversary special edition of <em>The Wake</em> by British prog rockers IQ includes a DVD with a video of the band sitting listening to the music and commenting on how the album was made. Since it's a video commentary about an audio track, this could be seen as a deconstruction of sorts.
<ul><li> The 30th anniversary edition of <em>Tales from the Lush Attic</em> also includes a commentary, but this time it's presented as an audio mp3 with the music playing in the background.
</li></ul></li><li> The website <em>Genius</em> (formerly known as <em>Rap Genius</em> before they expanded their scope) provides annotations with analysis and explanations on various song lyrics. Some songs will have official annotations by the artist themselves, and these will be marked in green. One particular example is the one for <a class="urllink" href="https://genius.com/4598539">Jakakiss's "Why"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where he, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">insists that George Bush knocked down the twin towers and that they are withholding a cure for AIDS.</a>

<ul><li> The commentary for their documentary <em>Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns</em> is entertaining. The Johns are joined by the director (A.J. Schnack) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ThisAmericanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ThisAmericanLife">Sarah Vowell</a>, who's interviewed in the movie. Schnack mostly sticks to talking about making the movie, Linnell mainly points out little oddities in the film, but Flansburgh and Vowell (usually in tandem) go off on all sorts of weird tangents that have no relation to the movie, and sometimes the others go along with them.

<ul><li> Likewise, creator commentary for cutscenes can be bought in the secrets shop in <em>Jak X: Combat Racing</em>. It offers insight in how the scenes were animated, ideas that didn't make it into the game, and a crew member doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">an imitation of a colleague</a> who couldn't be there during recording.

All make sure to point out "what went wrong" (in many movies, the guys are so happy talking over it appears nothing did) and "Inevitable dash of pretension" (since there's <em>always</em> a comparison or compliment too highbrow considering the product on screen).
</li><li> The DVD set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BrokenSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BrokenSaints">Broken Saints</a></em> features a commentary track for <em>every single chapter</em>. Many of the tracks are with the core creative team: Brooke Burgess, Andrew West, and Ian Kirby. Some include other contributers to the series. <em>All</em> of them feature talkative writer-director Burgess, who spends much of the time telling in-depth stories about how the series came into being, explaining the plot and dialogue in ridiculous detail, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> to his favorite movies, books, and TV shows, and encouraging you <em>not</em> to listen to his performance as Gabriel on the voice-over track.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> DVDs feature commentary which are, like the series, hilarious. Initially it featured some of the main crew commenting on unusual shots, remarks about specific jokes including a few that might of been hard to catch and a great deal of back and forth banter between those recording. Later on answering questions posted online was included during slow periods and comments on scenes or jokes that were cut. More commentators were added each season as well.
<ul><li> One particular bit is on the Season 1 DVD in which a humorous story is told about Gus, the guy who voices Simmons, and a trip to Las Vegas which was referenced in the series itself.

<ul><li> One notable one is when Strong Bad gets an e-mail saying "make a cartoon with just u in it, and u do the commentary." When the DVD email collection was released, the commentary on top of the email had a second layer of Strong Bad commentary talking about his previous commentary.

<ul><li> The DVD features even more. Doug and Rob have separate ones that both start with warnings that everything the other says is a lie, then go on to include many of the same anecdotes and jokes, though they do strongly disagree on whether a certain scene needed music. Rob also goes into quite nauseating detail on the leg injury he suffered during the shoot. There's also one with Bargo and Mike Michaud with some neat tidbits about running the site on top of the film itself, though after an hour they completely run out of things to talk about and their comments become more and more random.
</li><li> Now Linkara and Phelous have another commentary, bringing along Obscurus Lupa and Nash for the perspective of people who were just fans at the time. The result is half serious commentary, half jokes about how Lupa and Nash actually were there, and were just doing things off camera the whole time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuburbanKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuburbanKnights">Suburban Knights</a> has them too; while overall a much easier experience than <em>Kickassia</em>, there's still plenty of discussion about how the weather refused to cooperate (and they were stupid enough to spend the one day when the weather was good filming indoor scenes) and some people were much more comfortable than others, depending on how warm their costume was and whether they were inside or outside.
<ul><li> Doug and Rob have them on the DVD again, making it clear that while it was an easier experience for the actors, it was a much harder one for them as they struggled to figure out how the project could possibly be completed given the huge weather problems, until they were ultimately forced to make the film far more of a pure comedy than Doug had intended. There's also one by line producers Holly and Iron Liz, which gets off to a rough start as they experience some technical difficulties, but soon settles into providing some more great information about the shoot.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets">Marble Hornets</a></em> commentary is excellent for relieving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">paranoid insomnia</a> the series is likely to induce, courtesy of revelations regarding silly obstructions to filming (Entry #7 took forever to film due to cat poop, Tim kept ruining shots by making silly faces...).

They often give extra information on the story or the creative process. Or just make farting noises for half the episode.
<ul><li> Sometimes their commentary is hilariously inane. For example, from the commentary on <em>The Western Air Temple</em>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Mike:</strong> Hello once again, this is Mike DiMartino, co-creator and executive producer of Avatar.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bryan:</strong> And this is Bryan Konietzko, the other...guy.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mike:</strong> Who does a lot of stuff...Like co-creation.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bryan:</strong> I usually co-create between like, 9:30 AM and 9:41.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mike:</strong> And then you're executive producer in the afternoon?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bryan:</strong> I make executive products between like, 10:01 and 10:14.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mike:</strong> Wow.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bryan:</strong> What about you Mike?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mike:</strong> I take the 2:00 to 3:30 shift on the executive production.
</div><ul><li> There's also Avatar Extras, which gives small blurbs of random trivia about the various things in the show, including inspirations for scenes and scenery, background information for characters that didn't get much in the series, and the occasional snarking.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Bumi</strong>: Welcome to Old People Camp. <br/><strong>Avatar Extras</strong>: Dinner at 4 o' candle and bedtime at 6:30 o' candle.
</div><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> continues the tradition of hilarious commentary. For example, they start off <em>Skeletons in the Closet</em> with voice manipulators: Mike, Bryan, and Jeremy Zuckerman (music composer for the show) have squeaky voices like they just sucked in helium, and Ben Wynn (sound designer) has a ridiculously deep voice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">It's as hysterical as it sounds</a>.
<ul><li> The commentary for <em>The Voice in the Night</em> reveals that Mike and Bryan met Seychelle Gabriel (Asami) at a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">windsurfing event</a>" that didn't go so well<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4thoj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4thoj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4thoj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gabriel also portrayed Princess Yue in the live-action adaptation</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The commentary for episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> are odd in that series creator and multiple character voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> uses his normal speaking voice for Brian, a talking dog, so he appears to be doing the commentary in-character. He also flat out <em>refuses</em> to do the voices of any of the characters he voices (Peter, Stewie, Quagmire etc) during said commentary. Usually with (hopefully tongue-in-cheek) threats of violence against whoever suggested it.
<ul><li> Only if someone asks; if the fancy strikes him, he'll throw in a line or two in the voice of Peter and Stewie. Although he usually tells them to fuck off in character. Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethGreen">Seth Green</a> sounds nothing like Chris Griffin or Neil Goldman (his two main voices) so he has to be asked to drop into character. Mike Henry (Cleveland Brown, Herbert) does his voices without being asked.
</li><li> The commentaries featuring Danny Smith meanwhile tend to give an idea of just how insane the people who write the show are. The one for 'Indecent Proposal' in particular has the cast repeatedly accusing him of being extremely drunk while he claims to be 'high on life.'
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> also has loads of commentaries, and often help highlight how this show grew into a different show than <em>Family Guy</em>.
<ul><li> The early episode "Bullocks for Stan" spoofs the concept. Klaus narrates a conversation between Stan and Francine, and when asked he says he's pretending he's recording DVD commentary for his life. Near the end of the episode, Klaus' narration pops in at a couple of points where he's not involved, playing with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">Animated Actors</a> aspect by mentioning the tragic death of one of their extras and complaining about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> forced them to give Stan a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">Glurge-filled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Out-of-Character Moment</a> to close out the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> commentaries are well known for being raucous, free-ranging affairs with the various voice actors cracking jokes and telling funny stories about the show's production. They also often feature the voice actors doing imitations, and when a voice actor does imitations they're <em>really</em> good. The Season 5 DVD set features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDiMaggio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDiMaggio">John DiMaggio</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest">Billy West</a> doing a recurring sketch as Tracy Morgan being interviewed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno">Jay Leno</a> (Jon DiMaggio's Tracy Morgan impression is disturbingly good).
<ul><li> Ones involving John DiMaggio (the voice of Bender) are particularly good, thanks to the actor's obvious huge enjoyment of the show shining through.
</li><li> The show's future was still in question for years, and in the commentary for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS3E18AnthologyOfInterestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS3E18AnthologyOfInterestII">Anthology of Interest II</a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceLaMarche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceLaMarche">Maurice LaMarche</a> asks "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingInHindsight">we had a fifth season</a>?"
</li><li> Some of the episodes have bonus commentary tracks focusing on a particular subject; "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E7JurassicBark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E7JurassicBark">Jurassic Bark</a>" has one with eight of the show's writers describing the writing process, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E2AFarwellToArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E2AFarwellToArms">A Farewell to Arms</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E23GameOfTones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E23GameOfTones">Game of Tones</a>" both have animator commentaries with a group of directors and animators discussing the production process.
</li><li> David X. Cohen, the show's co-creator along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a>, is also great to listen to because of how utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">One of Us</a> he is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> animator, producer, and creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> has probably recorded more audio commentaries than anyone else alive. He has made sure that <strong>EVERY SINGLE</strong> episode (up to the end of season 17 anyway, when the DVD boxsets were discontinued) and movie that he has been involved in has a commentary track on the DVD, and he is personally on most of them.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow">Talk Show</a> host and former staff writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> is on the commentary track of a few of the episodes he wrote like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E12MargeVsTheMonorail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E12MargeVsTheMonorail">Marge vs. the Monorail</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E12BartGetsFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E12BartGetsFamous">Bart Gets Famous</a>", in which he guest-starred right after getting the gig hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LateNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LateNight">Late Night</a></em>.
<ul><li> At least one such appearance is in the form of an alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> commentary to an episode he wrote. This was in lieu of an appearance on the 'main' commentary.
</li></ul></li><li> And of course, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em> also has two commentaries. It also does something rare — the movie actually stops at points so that the commentators don't talk over too much of the action.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E1TheCityOfNewYorkVsHomerSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E1TheCityOfNewYorkVsHomerSimpson">The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson</a>" has two tracks, because the writer of the episode, Ian Maxtone-Graham, missed the first recording. As a treat, Dan Castellaneta joins in on track two. A number of season 3 &amp; 4 episodes also have similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> commentaries with showrunners Al Jean or Mike Reiss when one of them missed the main recording.
</li><li> Of particular note is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily">The Cartridge Family</a>", where Mike Scully (then the show's head writer) calls up a man named "John" who we are led to believe is John Swartzwelder (who has credit on this and 58 other episodes), a man who refuses to appear in the commentaries despite his massive contributions to the show. Matt Groening is at first stunned that they were actually able to trap him like this, but at the end of the call "John" denies that he's the real Swartzwelder. To this day it's unknown if this really is the real guy or was just a gag.
</li><li> Most cast members have also joined in commentaries, with Yeardley Smith probably doing the most. Guest stars have also appeared, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>, Joe Mantegna, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz">Jon Lovitz</a>, Gary Marshall and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>.
</li><li> Also notable is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E3AnotherSimpsonsClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E3AnotherSimpsonsClipShow">Another Simpsons Clip Show</a>", where they're stuck with almost nothing to talk about, so they instead take viewers through the process of how an episode is created, from beginning to end. This ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">Funny Moment</a> when after the full elaboration of all the work done by a ton of people, David Mirkin notes that the very final step is when the fans declare it the worst episode ever.
</li><li> Truly nerdy fans of the show may have picked up on several running themes and gags over the course of the commentaries. For example, John Swartzwelder's refusal to make an appearance is talked about on a number of occasions, as well as the Tube Bar tapes being the inspiration for Bart's prank calls to Moe, and the various censorship fights that the show has had.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> DVDs has had notorious luck with this: the season one set infamously had its full-length commentary tracks pulled prior days before the physical production of the sets were to begin, all because then-distributor Warner Bros. got pissed off at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> for explaining their hatred for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact">Contact</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>. Season two lacked commentaries and by the time they returned for season three, Parker and Stone had gotten jaded on the concept of doing commentaries and opted to just do "mini-commentaries" that last for only a few minutes at start of each episode, that only briefly scratches the surface of each episode.
<ul><li> This is not to say that the mini commentaries are uninformative or boring, however. Trey and Matt later defended the commentaries' short length, claiming that, while they enjoy doing them, the ever-shortening production time for each episode and lack of second-guessing during which leaves very little to actually talk about.
</li><li> Parker and Stone pissing off their corporate masters was lampshaded, in the special edition DVD of "Imaginationland", as far as them exploiting the fact that everything they say that Comedy Central might consider to cause liability will in effect be bleeped out, to great comedic effect.
<ul><li> The two have also repeatedly claimed that they quite enjoy doing commentaries and often look forward to completing a season just so they can record them. The most extreme example of this being "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS13E14Pee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS13E14Pee">Pee</a>", which <em>wasn't even finished</em> when the commentary was being recorded.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> commentaries are notably surreal: the two creators are recorded at drastically different volumes and often talk about things that have nothing to do with the episode. This is remedied (the volume thing, at least) in the second season DVD, though. In both cases, though, many, <em>many</em> hints about the next season are dropped.
<ul><li> They repeatedly spoiled the ending of Season 3, claiming that nobody listens to the DVD commentary before watching the entire season. They got a signed photo from a fan who did just that at a convention.
</li><li> On the season 4 DVD they claim there commentary for Hansom Ransom is the worst commentary ever because the episode stops working and they cant get it to play again.
</li></ul></li><li> For the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">Fairly Odd Parents</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Abra-Catastrophe</em>, the commentary is done by Cosmo and Wanda.
</li><li> The DVD commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> features several members of the cast and production team, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez">Jhonen Vasquez</a> himself, and even including musician Kevin Manthei on a few bonus commentaries that feature him and Jhonen exclusively. Their commentaries are riotously funny and as crazy as you'd expect from some of the people they feature.
<ul><li> Some episodes have multiple commentary tracks (where one is with the music/storyboarding crew and the other is with the actors), but one episode has an alternate commentary track that is nothing but squealing pigs.
</li><li> The commentary is also severely censored in a large number of the episodes. People (usually Jhonen) will be talking, then the commentary track will spontaneously cut in the middle of a sentence for some stretch of time, then resume in the middle of a completely different sentence or at the end of a joke. The most obvious example of this is during <em>Invasion of the Idiot Dog Brain</em> wherein somebody asks Jhonen what he thinks of the merchandising for the show and you start to hear an answer before the audio is cut for at least a minute before resuming. In one interview, Rikki Simons postulated that the reason for the censorship was just good old-fashioned hatred on Nickelodeon's part.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> DVD has a commentary track for an episode which isn't too odd. What <em>is</em> odd is the inclusion of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">potentially annoying</a>" commentary track <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">about the original commentary track.</a></em>
<ul><li> There's also the commentary they for an episode where they brought in a total stranger from off the street and asked him about the episode as he watched it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> movie, when the characters are trapped in a flooding room with no idea how to escape, Foxxy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">turns on the DVD commentary</a> and listens until the creators talk about how they wrote themselves out of this one.
</li></ul></li><li> Toys R Us included a free bonus disc with their copies of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbChristmasVacation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbChristmasVacation">Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!</a></em> DVD. The bonus DVD features the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "The Chronicles of Meap" with two audio commentaries, one by the creators, and the other by the characters they voice, in which we learn that Major Monogram considers Meap to be terrifying) and Dr. Doofenshmirtz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">does not approve</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Ferb's crush on Vanessa</a>.
<ul><li> The DVD release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension">Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension</a></em> includes the series episode "Attack of the 50-Foot Sister" with this same treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sealab2021" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sealab2021">Sealab 2021</a></em>'s DVD commentaries are particularly insane (much like the show). Of note is that the commentary over several episodes has no bearing on the episode itself. The highlight of this is the commentary over two episodes merely being one of the writers reading a comic book he did for a 4th grade project.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> commentaries are interesting, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> appears on commentaries for episodes that were done after he was fired.

They're also perfectly willing to poke fun at their work the few times it deserves it, like the difficulties in animating the Batmobile driving on hills, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSecurityCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSecurityCam">Magical Security Cam</a> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE14HeartOfIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE14HeartOfIce">Heart of Ice</a>".

</li><li> Commentary tracks for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> are of course extremely short, and tend to break down into one of two types: A fairly serious track with the writer/writers and director talking about the plot; or a track featuring creator Pen Ward with actors Jeremy Shada, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDiMaggio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDiMaggio">John DiMaggio</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKenny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKenny">Tom Kenny</a>, which while nominally informative, is usually filled with the four joking with each other and riffing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">some of the show's insanity</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps the strangest ever recorded was for the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a></em> shorts by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky">Genndy Tartakovsky</a>, a rambling and timid affair clearly ad-libbed in the most disastrous manner possible. The results were so bad that a separate "Hyperspace Commentary" (which seems to translate to simply "Commentary that doesn't suck") was included on the DVD and there Genndy holds his own okay, but why the first track was included as well continues to mystify.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em> features commentary on a few episodes of their DVDs. One of the more bizarre ones being for the season 3 episode, "It's Time To Pay The Price", which begins Brendon Small and H. Jon Benjamin doing a improvised jam session, and it doesn't stop until around halfway through the episode!
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a> Season 1 dvd exists a one episode commentary where Frankie Mac the rest of the gang and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">Bloo</a> riff on the episode Store Wars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">bash the practices of dvd commentaries</a> and try to discover the actual truth that happened that day ending in Bloo successfully convincing everyone else to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">pulverize Madame Foster</a> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">he doesn't get in trouble.</a>
</li><li> The complete season boxsets for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> feature commentaries from various cast and crew members. They give trivia about the shows production, crack jokes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">usually at their own expense</a>), and discuss the thought-processes behind the shows writing. Theres a great bit where Garry Chalks phone goes off during the commentary; the second he leaves the room to answer it, Alec Willows and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottMcNeil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottMcNeil">Scott McNeil</a> immediately start making fun of him and insinuating that his mom is calling to check on him.
