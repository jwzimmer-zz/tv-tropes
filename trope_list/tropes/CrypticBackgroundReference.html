</p><p>One way of building background is to have the characters refer to things without explaining exactly what those things are. The slight confusion caused is balanced by the sense given of a larger world, outside the plot. If a story is extended to a long enough series (especially when there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">high turnover of writers</a>), most of these cryptic references will eventually be explained and/or used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder">Canon Fodder</a>, but often one or two will still never appear <em>in story</em>. What such references really mean are a favorite subject for fan discussions and a breeding ground for various theories. The rise of the web, and later social media, has somewhat reduced the incidence of such things, as it has become easier to just <em>ask</em> the creators what something means; they'll probably answer it if doing so won't spoil future plot developments. Of course, this hasn't totally eliminated them, as there are some things that the creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">just don't care enough about to answer or think is better left to fan interpretation</a>.

See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">Hufflepuff House</a> for organizations with this treatment more referred to than seen. If the reference in question is actually explained later on, it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>.

<ul><li> Considering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame">Blame!</a></em> is a series that prides itself in its sheer vagueness, it isn't a big surprise that this trope shows up at least <em>once a chapter</em>. Technology and factions are seen, mentioned and interacted with often, but in most cases, never fully explained. This adds to the already frighteningly vast feel of the '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Verse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Verse">Verse</a>, and leaves plenty of room for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> does this all the time, sometimes without even directly saying anything. It oftentimes does this with the main plot and character traits — e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Ein</a> is a "data dog", something apparently important and rare which is only vaguely explained, even in the episode where it's mentioned. This is subtly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> — Jet angrily asks Spike why he's running off to kill a man from his past. Spike pointedly (even cynically) asks him how he lost his arm, causing Jet to clam up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The circumstances behind Spike's pursuit of the man and Jet's lost arm are eventually revealed.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>:
<ul><li> This anime features the characters spouting a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a> phrases that won't mean anything until a good twenty episodes later. It gets pretty confusing when half of the spoken terms have no meaning to the viewer.
</li><li> Its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO">Eureka Seven AO</a></em> is slightly better. There are a lot of references to events in the past, and several hints that there is something off about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>. They also managed to cut the introduction to meaning rate by about 50%, meaning that almost every truly cryptic and bizarre thing has been given some measure of explanation or meaning within 10 episodes, as opposed to the 20 mentioned above. Yes, if you just started watching, that means that the Alternate Universe thing will get explained very soon.

</li><li> The Magic World is filled to the brim with this type of stuff, with people referring to all sorts of races, animals, places, and phenomena that don't happen here.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: Shoto Todoroki's backstory reveals he has three siblings. The second oldest, his sister Fuyumi is introduced after the Sports Festival and their middle sibling, Natsuo, is introduced when the manga is about 180 chapters in, but their oldest brother is not even mentioned. In chapter 192 when Natsuo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology">refuses to hear to the apology</a> of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Abusive Parent</a> Endeavor, hints finally start being dropped, including that the older brother is named Toya and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">something</a>" that happened to him by which Endeavor is (rightfully or not) blamed for and that has fomented their mother's breakdown.
</li><li> The Hidden Cloud Village in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> was introduced long after the other four major ninja villages. The only proof of their existence was that a small number of Cloud ninja applied for the Chunin Exams early into the series, and after that, they were completely absent for several important arcs. The Hidden Cloud Village was even nonexistent among the Akatsuki, an alliance of villains from various ninja villages who have disowned their home villages in protest. This becomes a plot point later on after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Hidden Leaf Village is destroyed by Akatsuki leader Pain and the village leaders gather together to discuss how to stop them. As the Akatsuki has no Cloud ninja, they've never attacked the Hidden Cloud Village, so the village leader makes it clear he has no reason to get involved.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>:
<ul><li> A very subtle one. When Mami explains why Witches are bad, she mentioned them luring people to suicide and causing fights to break out in certain places. The second type of bad influence is never seen in the anime.
</li><li> It's also hinted that she knew <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyoko, and Kyoko's past</span> — but this is actually confirmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">a Drama CD</a>.
</li><li> Several are found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the manual(s)</a>. The official website describes three witches who never appeared in the anime, because only their familiars did. We don't even know what they look like. Then we have the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Walpurgisnacht is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">only a nickname.</a> It's real name is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks">only listed as "?????"</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Of course, Mami also mentions that Witches cause "natural disasters" in addition to the suicides. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> about Walpurgis is that it's actually a Witch that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grew stronger by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">combining</a> with other witches.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em>, there are very occasional references to the fact that some great catastrophe has happened and Japan, with the aid of the Sybil system, is one of the few relatively normal nations left.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> has a hierarchy of gods and demons distributed over four universes. Only some of these deities are described, others are named or merely implied. Nothing is known about the demons Chaotic Blue and Death Fog, for instance, and less than that about their opponents. Fanfic authors have, naturally, expended much effort to fill the gaps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky">Sound of the Sky</a></em> is rife with this trope. Most of the back story can be divided into two categories. There's the information that was lost forever during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffScreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffScreenWar">Great Off Screen War</a>, which isn't explained since none of the characters are aware of it. And then there are the things that all of them know about, which isn't explained since the characters have no reason to exposit out loud about it when speaking to each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YokohamaKaidashiKikou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YokohamaKaidashiKikou">Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> story of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> named Alpha running a small cafe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosyCatastrophe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosyCatastrophe">during the twilight of humanity</a>. Numerous mysteries are touched upon but <em>absolutely none</em> are explained fully, either because they have nothing to do with the story as previously outlined, or the characters are just as much in the dark as the readers.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> uses this trope a <em>lot,</em> especially in the earlier volumes when the universe wasn't so fleshed out. There are constant references to heroes, villains, and incidents that the readers have not seen yet - and sometimes never see, since the story is more about how people think and live in a superhero world than about the actual exploits of the heroes. The author, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a>, uses this trope a lot in his work - the same treatment is given to his magic-replaced-technology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Arrowsmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Arrowsmith">Arrowsmith</a>,</em> among others.

To the point where a reference guide for all of the bits in the first collected comic was three times the thickness of the comic itself. One panel could have two pages worth of 'This is the X from Y', especially in their museum base.
</li><li> This pops up in another work by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea">Promethea</a></em>. There are several references to adversaries and events from Promethea's past that are never seen or elaborated upon. The Shadow Queen however is probably the most notable since she is referred to several times without any details about her nature or ambitions revealed to the audience.

At the time of writing both races had an alliance with the Confederacy which would rule out any logical reason.

The follow-up series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/USAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/USAvengers">U.S.Avengers</a></em> mentions it again, with the future Captain America saying only that it was "worse" than Zero Day, when pretty much <em>every</em> major hero died at Thanos's hands.

Many years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> took many of Barks's offhand references and used them as the basis of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines">Pokémon Reset Bloodlines</a></em> has these aplenty. When it grew into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, many of them were explored in sidestories:
<ul><li> At the beginning, it's revealed that Professor Oak made the world a better place 40 years before Ash awakened in the Reset timeline. The details at first are mostly unknown, save for the fact that thanks to his efforts, Pokémon are for the most part less agressive and more tolerant of humans. The story also drops an early hint that he and Professor Hastings from the Ranger Nations are friends and often work together in secret, despite their nations being in a state of cold war with each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Oak &amp; Hastings Gaiden reveals that they worked together using technology behind Hastings's Capture Styler to develop a machine capable of pacifying aggressive Pokémon. However, they agreed to keep the bigger specifics a secret and have Oak tell full credit for it.</span>

<ul><li> They ended decades ago and both sides are currently in a cold war state.
</li><li> They were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">horrible</a>.
</li><li> The Draconids of Hoenn ended up allied with the Ranger nations as a result of territorial disputes with Sootopolitans, and this causes problems in the present day for Hoenn.
</li><li> The incident that caused it to explode was the attack of a Gyarados school and the disagreement over catching or relocating them somewhere else so they wouldn't hurt anybody.
</li></ul></li><li> Georgia goes through a mental list of gym leaders and Elite Four who had to be removed for committing crimes shortly after she was introduced. In order of increasing severity of their crimes, a Flying-type gym leader who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeepingTom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeepingTom">Peeping Tom</a>, a Bug-type gym leader who was a home invader and burglar, a Normal-type Elite Four who was involved in rigged matches, a Poison-type gym leader who committed sabotage, a Ghost-type gym leader who committed several murders and a Dark-type gym leader who was the leader of an Apocalypse Cult. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Ghost-type gym leader was elaborated on, and it turns out he was responsible for murdering Georgia's parents as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, thus providing the motivation for Georgia to become a Buster.</span>
</li><li> An infamous criminal known as Twenty Gyarados Bill is cited as the cause of the current limit for six active Pokémon per trainer. His story is explored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode">in his own gaiden.</a>
</li><li> The Fisher Clan are stated to have the Victreebel family as their signature Pokemon, with the clan winning many battles with them in the past. The Jeanette Interlude sidestory elaborated on that and it turns out the reason Victreebel is their signature Pokemon is because the founder of the Fisher Clan was a Victreebel Bloodliner.
</li><li> In the Big P Pokemon Race Interlude, Lara Laramie says her family has lived in harmony with wild Pokemon since her grandfather's time. The Laramie Gaiden explores how Lara's grandfather decided to establish the Pokémon reserve.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>My Little Pony</em> fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBlackStallion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBlackStallion">The Black Stallion</a></em> doesn't explain what "nyru" are. All that's known is that they hunt ponies.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending">Jupiter Ascending</a></em> is actually pretty good at world-building with background references and a surprisingly interesting universe, one reference in particular feels cryptic. Caine, the part-wolf part-human super soldier, is said to have ripped the throat out of an Entitled, yet he doesn't remember the incident taking place and apparently was informed of its occurrence by his mentor, Stinger. The only indication that it actually happened is that he was court-martialed for the crime, and is no longer a skyjacker. Who the Entitled was, the reasons for it occurring, and why Caine is said to have done it in a fit of rage when we never see him acting out of rage at any point in the movie, is never expanded upon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jack Sparrow makes several <em>non sequitur</em> references to his past exploits (e.g., "And then they made me their chief.", "Clearly you've never been to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore">Singapore</a>.") that enrich his character. The sequels try to tie the movies together by creating plot points out of them.
</li><li> When we actually do get to Singapore we never find out exactly what Jack did to offend Sao Feng, so this trope appears again.
</li><li> Also, Elizabeth's speech on Black Sam's Spit: "But you're Captain Jack Sparrow. You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau port without firing a shot. Are you the pirate I've read about or not?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RioLobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RioLobo">Rio Lobo</a></em>: When Hendricks is first mentioned, McNally refers to him as "Blue Tom" and mentions chasing him several times but never capturing him, although whether this is refers to Hendricks being a Civil war guerrilla or a pre-war outlaw is never mentioned.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Upon its original release, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> was a prime example of this, full of name-drops that have nothing to do with the plot but which combine to make the fictional world feel boundless and lived-in. References to the Imperial Senate, the Old Republic, "big Corellian ships" and the spice mines of Kessel are a few examples. Scenes that were cut in the original release, such as Han's confrontation with Jabba the Hutt, also make things like Greedo's confronting Han over something he did to wrong Jabba seem bigger. Every single throwaway line has been since filled in to ridiculous levels of detail by either the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequels</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>.
</li><li> Ironically the Expanded Universe has never introduced any ship to match Han's line about the "Imperial starcruisers" that are "big Corellian ships" (he <em>may</em> have been referring to Corellian Corvettes. However, this seems unlikely, as they weren't predominately used by the Empire, and, while big, were nowhere near as huge as Star Destroyers and the like.)
</li><li> More references include the Clone Wars, "that bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell...," the Kessel Run, "many Bothans died...," Han and Lando's history, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> Will and Ned from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em> often talked about their old gang.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWayOfTheGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWayOfTheGun">The Way of the Gun</a></em> makes a few references "what happened in Baltimore," some apparently shameful event in the OBGYN's past that has left him with limited opportunities.
</li><li> The term "Double D-anniversary" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatDreamsMayCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatDreamsMayCome">What Dreams May Come</a></em>. Christy and Annie are repeatedly referring to this event without giving an explanation until towards the end when we flash back to the scene where this term was coined:

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> was a master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a>, working on his Middle-Earth world from about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1">WW1</a> until his death. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> is full of lovingly crafted and referred-to details, many of which are left unexplained, whose stories first got public with the posthumous publications of the earlier stories.
<ul><li> One thing Tolkien knew from his studies as a linguist and English teacher is that some of the old myths recreate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticBackgroundReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticBackgroundReference">Cryptic Background Reference</a> effect <em>entirely by accident</em>, when the relevant poems or stories are lost — the medieval Finns probably had an explanation of what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSampo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSampo">Sampo</a> (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKalevala" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKalevala">The Kalevala</a></em>) is, for example, but it didn't survive the Middle Ages.

Now revel in all the references most people didn't get the first time around. That part of the song Aragorn sings in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> about Beren and Lúthien? Now you know the whole story. Bilbo's song about Eärendil that Aragorn seemed to find so cheeky to sing in Rivendell? It was about Elrond's father (and mother) who he hasn't seen in five thousand years and probably dredged up some bad memories about the ransacking of his home when he was a child by the sons of Fëanor. The list goes on.
</li><li> The Second Prophecy of Mandos, which describes what the end of the world will be like, is referenced (though not by name) in virtually all of the canonical stories of Middle-earth. However, the prophecy itself does not appear in canon — only in Tolkien's earlier drafts for <em>The Silmarillion</em>.

<ul><li> In the Mad Tea-Party scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadHatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadHatter">The Mad Hatter</a> proposes the riddle, "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" Some time passes before Alice, the Hatter and the March Hare all admit that they can't find the answer. This did nothing to stop readers from persistently trying to find answers such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> wrote on both." Although Carroll himself eventually came up with the answer "Because it can produce a few notes, though they are <em>very</em> flat; and it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">nevar</a> put with the wrong end in front!" Or "They both have inky quills".
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaNoWriMo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaNoWriMo">NaNoWriMo</a> novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereMonsters">And Then There Were Monsters</a></em>, some of the monsters mentioned in the text are explained in Father Mallern's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">journals</a>. Most are not. Dire cattle, for example, and referenced a few times, but never seen, and in the end all we know is that the only similarity they have with normal cattle is that they still have four legs.
</li><li> Alien characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> often allude to various other species or situations that have nothing to do with the plot:
<ul><li> For example, early books would sometimes list random species the Yeerks had supposedly enslaved, though practically none of them are seen except for Hork-Bajir, Taxxons and Gedds.
</li><li> There's also a whole subplot happening off-scene with a planet called Anati: apparently the Yeerks knew very little about it (including whether or not it was inhabited) and sent Visser One to conquer it, but she wound up failing for some unknown reason.
</li><li> "The Five", the mysterious race responsible for hunting the Venber to extinction. Ax doesn't know where they came from or why they called themselves that, but they have since also vanished, possibly due to the Andalites of old giving them a taste of their own medicine.

</li><li> Crayak, the closest thing the series has to Satan, was evicted from his galaxy of origin by an even <em>more</em> powerful being.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Mechwarrior Dark Age</em> novels (based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> game world) made references to events that had occurred in the 65-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> since the last published <em>BattleTech</em> novel. The result was a lot of terms used in general discussion that had no explanation - The Jihad, the Ruins of Gabriel, Apollyon, the Master and so forth. Since then, new <em>BattleTech</em> fiction has begun to explain some of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> has Mr. Willy Wonka noting that Loompaland, the homeland of the Oompa-Loompas — and a country none of the other characters have heard of — is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle">Hungry Jungle</a> full of "hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible wicked whangdoodles" without explaining what exactly those beasts are (besides <em>very</em> hungry). This isn't surprising, as Mr. Wonka himself has a never-explained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">Mysterious Past</a> and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">Inexplicably Awesome</a>. (For one thing, between the original novel and its sequel, he's apparently managed to travel the world <em>without being recognized</em> for years, and has knowledge of <em>other planets and alien races</em>. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">2013 stage musical</a> plays this concept for laughs with throwaway lines that reveal that he used to go to <em>raves</em>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em>: The protagonists meet a magician, who is later revealed to be personified star who was sent to earth as a punishment. On being asked what possible crime a star could commit, they are simply told: "it is not for you, a Son of Adam, to know what faults a star can commit." The reference gets even more cryptic when Eustace comments that in their world stars are balls of flaming gas and is told that even in our world, that is not what stars <em>are</em>, but only what they are <em>made of</em>.
</li><li> Aslan's father, the Emperor-Beyond-The-Sea, is mentioned but plays no direct role in the plot. Presumably the reason he's there at all is because Aslan, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Jesus-equivalent</a>, needs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">father</a> to complete the reference.
</li><li> There are plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> species in the setting, but there are a few unelaborated-on references to some of these species <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">being in Aslan's army.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Part of the charm of the early books of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath">Chronicles of the Kencyrath</a></em> is that the main character is a member of a race with ten thousand years of history, but our glimpses of this history is as through a glass darkly because the main character already knows her history and doesn't feel the need to monologue about it. The later books have filled in many of the references, but far from all of them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> stories, there are several mentions of a group called "The Children of the Sun" who were, it seems, wiped out by the Alerans relatively recently (historically speaking) and, as a last action, did <em>something</em>, <em>somewhere</em>, for <em>some reason</em> and now there's the Feverthorn Jungle in the middle of the continent, that no one can enter for reasons which are unexplained. Though we get a rough idea of where it is (middle southeast of the continent according to the map in <em>First Lord's Fury</em>) what makes the jungle impenetrable (even to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Vord</a></em>) is unexplained. The Alerans idly speculate that if they could figure out what the Children did, they might be able to turn it against the Vord.
<ul><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>, as Butcher explained it on the website. They're another sentient race (of plant-people, with Woodcrafting-like powers), who are now all dead, wiped out by the Roman legions shortly after they arrived on Alera (and hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">before they had developed significant furycrafting</a>). Of all the sentient races that have appeared on Alera, only the toughest survive the competition.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdMoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdMoons">The Cold Moons</a></em> throws around references to the badger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalReligion">Animal Religion</a> but doesn't explain the mythology in through. Some things are namedropped in passing but all that's clearly known is that: Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> is named "Logos", while their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>/devil is "Ahriman". Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">heaven</a> is "Asgard" and it's stated that all species live in harmony in Asgard. "Sheol" is referenced but it seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">hell</a> equivalent instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath">a Jewish-style Sheol</a>. Some badgers aren't prayed for upon dying and thus they become eternally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarredFromTheAfterlife">Barred from the Afterlife</a> in a place above the clouds called "Gehenna". "Elysia" is the pastures of heaven and is also used as a short-hand for an otherworldly paradise. Badgers have a group of ancient laws called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCommandments">the Adamus</a>" (which is only mentioned by name, in passing, in the final chapter).
</li><li> In the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em>, the third-person narrator often makes references to historical events and figures, such as the fall of Gilead and John Farson, as well as important characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">the gunslinger's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">past</a>. Many of these are clarified later in the series, further expanding the previously sparse world.
</li><li> The story of Princess Nell in Neal Stephenson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge">The Diamond Age</a></em> starts out like this, and Nell and the Primer spend the next decade or so expanding the references.
</li><li> Often used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, with throwaway references to things like the politics of the Guild of Engravers (although that one eventually became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>), or the various notes on Sam Vimes' desk that he's too busy with the main story to deal with, creating the feel that Ankh-Morpork keeps running even when there isn't a story happening.
</li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Distortionverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Distortionverse">Distortionverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Tryadine Effect case</em> which was solved by Veckert before the events told in <em>Chapter 1 - La Notte che Cammina</em> and resulted in the opening of the dome of St. Patrick SHIELD is <em>never</em> explained in details — only hinted at;
</li><li> The bombardment of Moscow mentioned by Egon Kramers in <em>Sabbie</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Domina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Domina">Domina</a></em>:
<ul><li> Loads. The names of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfHats">cultures</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">warlords</a> are dropped without context, only to be explained a dozen chapters later. Since there's lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a>, the audience has some clues to figure out what the names refer to before they appear on screen.
</li><li> The Dagonites get referenced every few chapters for hundreds of chapters, with no explanation. Even when Dagonite characters show up on screen, the other characters just note that they don't look as weird as they expected, and move on.
</li><li> Space colonies are referenced as well. A refugee from a minor mutiny on the Chinese Shaohao station crash-lands at one point, and later it's mentioned that the Soviet Tsiolkovsky Station is the communications hub for the colonies. Ceres gets a few mentions (it's implied to be a factory colony), and someone says that a character is from "Lemuria, on Mars."
</li><li> The fall of Eden is mentioned more than once as an important part of the city's past, but no context is given.
</li></ul></li><li> Stephen Brust's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> books use this in massive amounts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KhaavrenRomances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KhaavrenRomances">Paarfi's novels</a> are supposed to be historical fiction novels within the universe, so they assume that the reader is a Dragaeran who doesn't need additional explanations. Vlad sometimes seems to make the same assumption, but other times he explains common aspects of the world for the reader's benefit. Vlad will also make vague references to his various other misadventures outside of the scope of the current story without going into detail. Sometimes he says he doesn't want to digress, and other times he's simply cryptic. Some of these do get explained in future novels. Brust intentionally includes them as possible story hooks for future novels without planning on where they'll go.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> contain a fair amount of them, such as the reasons for some wizards not showing up to a White Council meeting in Chicago including "He got real married", "Living under a polar ice cap", and "Pyramid Sitting".
<ul><li> In a case that ultimately ended up a subversion; in the first book Harry mentions that Santa Claus is real, and implies he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassSanta">terrifying</a>. Fast forward fourteen books, and we finally meet him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays">Cold Days</a></em>, and get a good idea of why Harry would have been scared of him in the first book.
</li></ul></li><li> Used fairly frequently in Herbie Brennan's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieWarsChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieWarsChronicles">The Faerie Wars Chronicles</a></em>. Since most of the series is set in a fantasy realm with only two non-native characters present, references to simbala parlours, power outrages, border Redcaps, or The Reindeer King of Crippenmas are pretty commonplace. Some of these are given explanations in the glossaries, and a few end up connecting to the plots of later books, but many are left entirely unexplained.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em> novels have a handy store of ancient history at which to hint. Some characters (Vanyel, Lavan Firestorm) have had their own books, but she claims "Windrider" and "Sun and Shadow" likely will not, since they work better as distant legends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> is littered with these, with allusions to far-off planets and some of their inhabitants that are never explored in-depth. For instance, Maximegalon is apparently a planet with a very rich academic history, although it's never visited; neither is Blagulon Kappa, a world mentioned off-handedly several times but about which even less is explicitly stated. On the character side of things, Oolon Colluphid is apparently a very prestigious writer and an acquaintance of Zaphod Beeblebrox's (as of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing">the sixth book</a>), and some of his books have been named, but he's never personally encountered. The same goes for Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon VI, and ex-president Yooden Vranx, who <em>would</em> have been part of the first story arc, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">the author</a> wound up not going there. What's <em>really</em> interesting is that the many of the stars and systems he mentions are real, like Sirius. This amuses people with arbitrary knowledge of stars.
<ul><li> There's also a bunch of almost-correct ones. There is no real-life planet called Ursa Minor Beta, but there <em>is</em> a star called Beta Ursae Minoris.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveBarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveBarker">Clive Barker</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastIllusion">The Last Illusion</a></em>, the story mentions a botched exorcism attempt on Mimi Lomax which has scant but horrific detail. The novel "Everville" goes into this incident with more fleshing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoyalEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoyalEnemies">Loyal Enemies</a></em> has vampire kingdoms, which are alluded to a few times, and the islands, which are somewhere in Beloria, but we don't even learn in what direction.
</li><li> With the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterBloodTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterBloodTattoo">Monster Blood Tattoo</a></em> series, D. M. Cornish not only strives to make the Half-Continent feel lived in with side comments and throwaway lines, but he has so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">side characters</a> who appear and reappear within Rossamund's narrative that it leaves readers thirsty for all the potential other stories that could be told. There is, after all, a reason why the glossaries in the back of the books can be a third of the physical book.
</li><li> Much like the Sherlock Holmes example, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a></em> series by Rex Stout begins on terms of false familiarity, and vaguely references past cases that are never fully explained.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelEnde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelEnde">Michael Ende</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em>, many vague allusions are made to the further adventures of secondary characters, always accompanied by the phrase, "But that is another story, and will be told another time." Needless to say, said stories have never been told.
<ul><li> Actually plot-significant, and gives the book its title. In the ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bastian is told he can't leave until every storyline he started up is finished. But given the rate uncompleted plots have been created (several story hooks get created for every one he finishes) he'd never be done. Atreyu saves him by taking on the task on his behalf</span>. The movies leave this out, resulting in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em> is full of this. Particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s motivation for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sinking Atlantis. All we get is him shouting "THEY DESERVED IT!"</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s work has tons of this, but <em>Neverwhere</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em> are particularly big examples.
</li></ul><ul><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom">Old Kingdom</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthNix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthNix">Garth Nix</a>, and not overused, either. He's mentioned in interviews that he's not really into world-building  he just makes everything up as he goes along.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannuRajaniemi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannuRajaniemi">Hannu Rajaniemi</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief">The Quantum Thief</a></em> features many references to cataclysmic events that shaped the world of the novel, but remain a mystery to the reader, and sometimes even to the characters due to lost historical records and memory manipulation. These include the Collapse that caused most people to abandon Earth, the Cry of Wrath, the Spike which somehow destroyed Jupiter, and the Protocol War. Some get elaborated in the later books and even become major plot points, while others remain a mystery.
</li><li> In Raymond E. Feist's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em>, there is a place called Roldem in the east of Midkemia. It is mentioned in a few of the books, and included in every map of the world, however over the course of more than 20 books, it is not visited at all. In fact, most of the information on Roldem comes from a single e-mail written in 1998.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> stories, Watson is famous for this, often referring to other cases, such as the one involving "the giant rat of Sumatra, for which the world is not yet prepared". Some of these became stories in their own right (though usually not from Doyle's pen), but most remain unexplained.
</li><li> Used masterfully well in Ulysses Silva's novel <em>Solstice</em>. There is exactly one incident where things are properly explained by the main character (even then, it's mostly clarification on things you've picked up).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> novels are full of references to epic historical events and heroes, and the landscape is littered with ruins and relics of bygone ages. Some of it gets expanded on and turns out to be important to the backstory, but a lot is just hinted at to give the impression that the setting is <em>old</em> and didn't just sit there doing nothing until the main characters arrived.

Being ancient characters, they have witnessed events that happened THOUSANDS of years prior and have been losts to the mists of time, so nobody around them has any idea what they're talking about when they start spouting off references.
</li><li> And because time in the setting is cyclical, many of the references are in fact to actual historical events in our time, but with the details garbled by the passage of the ages. Many of the oldest songs and stories will actually be surprisingly familiar to readers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ">World War Z</a></em> is in love with this trope, with casual mentions of numerous events during the Zombie War that never gets explained in-depth.

Of the ones that have not:
<ul><li> The Sleeper is the most prominent example that remains cryptic, an S-class threat whose presence causes <em>an entire dimension</em> to be written off for reasons that are so obvious to everyone that the reader gets no explanation.
</li><li> Why Canberra, the capital city of Australia is covered by a giant dome has never been explained, even when many other cryptic references have been addressed via word of god.
</li><li> The Three Blasphemies are an S-Class group of supervillains mentioned to be terrorizing Europe. This wouldn't be too remarkable except it's been suggested that they aren't human.
</li><li> The Machine Army is a group of self-replicating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robots</a> that have been mentioned to be a persistent threat but have only been briefly featured in the narrative once.

Presumably, most of these references were pretty clear to the original Sumerian audience, who would be well-acquainted with these other stories, but no records of them are known to exist today, creating an extreme form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWeirdAlEffect">The Weird Al Effect</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> subverted this trope quite often, given that it was all plotted out in advance. For instance, the fates of all the previous Babylon stations seemed to be a case of simple world-building, to stress how dangerous the universe was. But then we learned what happened to them: Three destroyed, one vanished. Then the vanished one shows up again, having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstuckInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstuckInTime">Unstuck in Time</a>.

Other things, however, were left to the imagination. Such as what it was about Vree eating habits that disgusted G'Kar so much that he considered sitting next to them to be an insult to his entire government.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> did this sometimes. For example in "The Prom", Wesley mentioned the "Machash Wars".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> does this a lot by mentioning various ops the main characters have done before the start of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, all bets are <strong>off</strong>. The Doctor will routinely spout off about unexplained spatial phenomena, utterly bizarre alien cultures and references to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Last Great Time War</a> and too many other things to even think about listing. These are often expanded on in books or audio dramas, and occasionally later in the show itself.
<ul><li> Stories with the Third Doctor (and occasionally others) often make mention of an unnamed "monk" or "hermit" the Doctor knew long ago. The audience finally met the monk in the Third Doctor's final story. Whether the "hermit" was the same person has been the subject of much debate among fans.
</li><li> It's virtually guaranteed that whenever the Doctor meets the Master, they will talk about their childhood and various parts of their own backstories and identities, which of course will never be explained because of how important the mystery behind them (as well as the Time Lords and Gallifrey as a whole) is to both characters.
</li><li> Characters other than the Doctor are known to do this, too. For example, Captain Jack Harkness of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> fame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">This mostly has to do with various sexual exploits</a>, but he does mention actual bizarre past experiences. Random side-characters can do this too, usually to the Doctor or one of his companions, with the assumption that they're from the same period/place, and know what they mean.
</li><li> We know about Torchwood 1 (from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E12ArmyOfGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E12ArmyOfGhosts">"Army of Ghosts"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E13Doomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E13Doomsday">"Doomsday"</a>) and Torchwood 3 (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>). But the mysterious disappearance of Torchwood 4, and why Torchwood 2 is one guy, called Archie, above a bank in Glasgow, ("A very strange man") will probably never be revealed.
</li></ul></li><li> Unintentionally done in the TV series adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, where things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">that are explained in the books</a> are referenced, but are never explained in the series.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo">Fargo</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonOne">season 1</a>, characters like Lou Solverson and Ben Schmidt make references to the Sioux Falls massacre of 1979, which we later see for ourselves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonTwo">season 2</a>.

Some of the events transformed into foreshadowing after the 6th season finale revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she died giving birth to Rhaegar's son, whom her brother adopted and renamed Jon Snow</span>. In-universe, the abduction remains a cryptic reference even after the audience (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bran and Sam</span>) get a complete explanation in season 7.

Fans had a whole season to wonder, but the actual explanation was, perhaps inevitably, a bit of a letdown.
<ul><li> The title itself refers to How Ted Met the Mother of His Children. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It took until the end of season 8 before we saw her face</span>.

Also, there's what Nate did at the Russian border. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he may have technically hijacked a train,</span> but that hasn't been mentioned on the show and likely never will be.

</li><li> The other most common thing are events that occurred in the fictional gaps of time between the various eras (Approximately 100 years elapsed between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a>, 15ish years for TOS and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">The Wrath of Khan</a></em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">The Motion Picture</a></em> being close-ish to TOS' present), and 80ish for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">The Next Generation</a></em>. Significant things happened during those periods that are frequently referred to, but almost never shown on screen ("What happened to the <em>Enterprise</em>-B?" and the Earth-Romulan War being some of the big ones.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> naturally latches onto these things like crazy.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "The Omega Directive" it's mentioned that the titular directive was established after an accident with the Omega Particles happened to Federation scientists in 2269. The fact that 2269 is in the middle of Kirk's five year mission, and this neither references an episode of the original series, nor mentions any involvement from the Enterprise (but doesn't discount it) makes it all the more cryptic.
</li><li> They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">Double Subverted</a> this trope in regards to a specific alien race. Since TNG, there has been mention of an alien race called the Breen, though all that was known about them is that their homeworld is very cold. They finally show up in DS9, but in full body environmental suits that completely disguises their appearance, and nothing at all about their society is revealed. A throwaway line in DS9 suggests that they are extremely secretive by nature, so that not even the people in the shows know much about them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> referred in a couple of episodes ("The Adversary" and "Home Front") to a race called the Tzenkethi. All we learned was that their leader was called the Autarch, and that they'd previously fought a war with the Federation during which Ben Sisko served as first officer of the USS Okinawa under then-Captain Leyton. The EU used this as a jumping-off point for several novels, including making them a major player in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact">Typhon Pact</a> following the Dominion War, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> based an arc on them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that segued into another arc based on a CBR from <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, the reemergence of the Klingons' ancient enemies the Hur'q</span>.

An example:

Many of the early ones were given explanations later, but not all - for example, we still don't know whose uncle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Uncle Istvan</a> is supposed to be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em>. Even if you manage to read through every single supplement and piece together as much as you can, there are still a lot of holes. But, since the game's major theme is a world of mystical insanity seething just below the facade of normalcy, it's generally agreed that it just wouldn't make <em>sense</em> if everything made sense.
</li><li> The current incarnation of the Necrons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> was inspired largely by a throwaway line by Rick Priestley about "the quiescent perils of the C'tan" which "lay beyond the Gates of Varl". References were quietly worked into the game over the years in the form of the C'tan phase sword and phase knife, until the release of the first Necron codex where the C'tan were finally revealed as the "gods" of the Necrons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">indescribably ancient and evil monsters which feed on suns</a>.
<ul><li> There are also the two "missing" Space Marine Primarchs and their Legions. Every mention of the twenty Primarchs lists numbers II and XI as "All records deleted", and EU works have consistently refused to give any detail about who they were or what happened to them.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> series of novels and audiobooks have touched on the subject obliquely, ranging from intimations of an accident at the gestation stage, to something so shameful and terrible that the Imperium refuses to acknowledge them, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">daemon</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">worshiping</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">civilian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">massacring</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">backstabbing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">psychopathic unrepentant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">bastards</a> are still listed in the records (admittedly, usually with the note "Explode planet on rumour of presence", but still). The exact details have never been revealed and are unlikely to be either, this is lampshaded by characters telling each other not to even <em>think</em> about discussing the details.
</li><li> The closest we get is a throw-away line saying that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf">Space Wolves</a></em> had previously been ordered to attack a Space Marine Legion.
</li><li> The Rainbow Warriors chapter of Space Marines remains incredibly cryptic even decades after their first appearance... Which featured one of the Sisters of Battle gunning one of their members down with no accompanying explanation. They were not mentioned again until years later when White Dwarf published a map with a "record deleted" message stamped across their honeworld.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Now that the game numbers something like 50 books, there's very little in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> that was mentioned in the first book that hasn't gotten a description by now. One of the biggest examples was the Republicans, which was an off-hand mention in the first book about a technological society living in the ruins of Washington, D.C. It was the subject of several unofficial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebooks</a> (called Netbooks) until they were finally described in the Expanded Edition of the original Sourcebook. There are still a few things here and there that have gotten mentioned but still not shown. The most notorious is the permanently-open Rift in Calgary, Alberta, and the monster kingdom that's developed there, as well as others like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Blood Druids</a> of France.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This happens once a game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNightSwordcraftStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNightSwordcraftStory">Summon Night: Swordcraft Story</a></em> games: random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> come into the scene and reference something that would make sense as part of a longer plot but which you don't know about. ("I would gladly fight to the death to follow the last orders of Master Shinrai!" ...Master who?) How much of this is the result of this actually being a spin-off series of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SummonNight">larger plot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">that never made it outside Japan</a> isn't immediately obvious to English-speaking players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> contained the mysterious line "You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance," prompting much debate on just who "Sheng Long" was and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">a rumor that he was an unlockable character</a>. It was eventually explained that the name actually just referred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">one of Ryu's attacks</a>, not another person. But still...
<ul><li> Then there's Bison/Vega crowing about how "The Ancient One" couldn't face him. And Fei Long dedicating his art to "the master and his son" (actually a reference to Bruce Lee, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone">Fei Long's expy source</a>). And those three college students who inspired Sakura to take up fighting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">And</a> anything at all involving Gill. That's not even touching on the whole sordid tale of how Charlie Nash's death happened, or for that matter, <em>where</em> it happened, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">has so many possible explanations by now</a>, it qualifies as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>.
</li><li> Undoubtedly the biggest issue involving said Sheng Long, the canon ending to the first tournament. Other than the basic fact of Ryu hitting Sagat really, really hard, we're <em>never</em> going to know for sure what actually happened. The most likely scenario, in fact, involves Ryu connecting with Sagat's chin (the usual one hit KO location for MMA); any blow to the <em>chest</em> forceful enough to put away a brawny heavyweight would've left a much larger scar than what Sagat's currently sporting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> enjoys this quite a bit. The meaning of the phrase that started the series, "You are the one who will open the door to light" has still not been fully explained. In the first game, Sora <em>closes</em> the Door to Darkness; in the second, he finds Kairi's letter, which does open a path back home, but as he's not the one opening it technically, it's unknown just what the phrase means.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> lives on this trope - Throwaway references became major plot elements in later games - such as Lemon's last name, and referring to a 'Beowulf' who piloted a 'Gespenst Mk. III' (Alt Eisen) - obscure references to the previous game, where the protagonist's theme called was 'Steel Beowulf' and his unit was revealed to have been a modified Gespenst Mk. I considered for mass production. And many, many more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers">Mischief Makers</a></em> treats all the characters as already established, and new characters are often brought in with the assumption that they've had encounters with main character Marina in the past.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>. There are references to shared histories between characters, and to a war ten years ago with armies of robots from "the surface" attacking the Island, and to three bearers of the Demon Crown prior to the Doctor. There's just enough information to construct a vague timeline for the backstory, but it's obvious that there's more to the history than what we're told. When asked for further information about the game's world, the writer has said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">he himself doesn't know</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> includes many fictional quotes from the game's characters and other people in the game's world. These as well as a handful of other game elements are the only inside look we have into what life on Planet is really like (unless you read the novelizations, anyway). Many details are left to the imagination, such as, "What exactly is 'nerve stapling', anyway?" Somehow, it works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, during the final encounter with Nrvnqsr, he and Arcueid have a conversation on things that you don't learn until much later in the game, or in supplemental materials. This is intensified by the use of code-like terms, such as referring to Roa as the "Serpent of Akasha".
</li><li> From both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> games, the only parts of the story that are completely laid out for you are from the single 4-chapter comic ("The Sacrifice"), and the short character bios that each of the Survivors get (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">neither of which are found in-game</a>). The rest of the plot that's given to you will only be through random (often campaign-specific) character dialogue, about 99% of which isn't even guaranteed to trigger (usually requiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">multiple play-throughs</a> if you want to catch everything), or occasionally from significant pieces of the map, but most of all from the writings on the walls of different saferooms (and occasionally elsewhere) of other people who have passed through that area, describing bits of their experiences as messages to others, agreement or disagreement with what the military is/was doing, just how bad CEDA failed, how fast somebody changes into a zombie after being infected, and so forth, but not even those people are in 100% consensus about whatever's been going on, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">nobody really has any idea what even</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">started</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">the whole thing.</a> We might get some answers eventually, but given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve">Valve</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare">reputation for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">making third installments,</a> it's probably not going to be any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> has this to an extent.

Since the release, more of the history leading up to the game has been revealed, and additional bits about some of the classes have come forward.
<ul><li> Potentially, the increase in backstory has only increased this trope. Why does the Announcer control both sides, pitting against each other for no apparent reason? What are her connections to Saxton Hale and the Redmond and Blutarch families? Why is friendship such an alien concept to her? What will the Engie do with all that secret deposits of Australium? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">How did the Soldier get a magician as a roommate?</a> (All this only appears in the addition material.

After all, reducing each other to bloody chunks is the point of the game.)
</li></ul></li><li> It seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Valve">Valve</a> is fond of this trope. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series is almost <em>entirely</em> built out of it.

</li><li> The <em>driving force</em> behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orochi">Orochi</a>, qualifies. The only things we know for certain are 1. it involves a horribly evil destructive power, 2. the clan is absolutely fanatical and will stop at nothing to raise their god, 3. the Kusanagi, Yagami, and Kagura clans were the ancestral foes of Orochi, 4. but the Yagami betrayed the alliance, causing their flames to turn purple. Everything else is a confused mishmash... some artifacts we never actually see (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Ash Crimson starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">pilfering the current clan members of their powers</a> in the <em>2003</em>-<em>XIII</em> arc</span>), "maidens" who may or may not have been slaughtered, Kyo getting preferential treatment causing Iori to go all emo or something, a bunch of sealing and unsealing attempts, "battle energy", earth worship and "returning all to nothing", Rugal of all people chosen as a guinea pig, self-destruction, betrayals, counter-betrayals, etc., etc. Worst of all are the numerous plot points and outright sequel hooks that are flat-out dropped, such as a heavily-implied rift between Rose and Adelheid at the end of <em>XI</em>.
<ul><li> It doesn't even end there. <em>KOF</em> mythos designates Orochi as "Gaia's Will"; it's not only the progeny of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNature">the earth mother</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek myth</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">bizarrely enough</a>), but her self-appointed guardian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">Gaia herself has yet to directly appear in any capacity</a> and is only mentioned in regards to her familial ties with Orochi and her creation of humanity, assuming she's mentioned at all. This begs the questions of where exactly <em>is</em> Gaia in the present, why did she create a being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">so fanatical in its duty to her</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">it vowed to destroy humanity</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">the very beings Gaia herself brought to life</a>), and why is she practically non-existent not only in the face of her child's actions, but when dealing with earthly matters as a whole. More headscratching ensues if you take into account <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep">the greater SNK universe</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsychoSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsychoSoldier">one of the tournament regulars</a> is the reincarnation/descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Athena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Athena">Gaia's great-granddaughter</a>.
</li><li> Those from the Past's goal to obtain the power of Orochi by breaking its seal (yet again) comes across as this, as it's never clearly spelled out during the Tales of Ash <em>what</em> their leader Saiki wants to do with it. Not even in <em>XIII</em>, the climax of the saga wherein said leader makes a formal appearance and all of his scheming comes to fruition. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Side materials</a> reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the group is more or less the Western European equivalent of the Orochi clan and Saiki needs Orochi to power an artifact known as the Gate (which does appear in <em>XIII</em>) so he can travel back in time and change the flow of history so as to prevent the cult from suffering a horrible loss to their human adversaries (presumably Elisabeth's ancestors, thus explaining her personal vendetta against them and the repeated, equally cryptic mentions of her and Ash's "mission")</span>. Sadly, little of this is explicitly mentioned in the game proper, and Saiki's shady, self-serving nature (complete with the implication that said explanation doesn't hold water) opens up grounds for further discussion.
</li><li> If there's one plot point in <em>KOF</em> that adheres to this concept more than anything else, it is—without a doubt—the Dragon Spirit. That subplot first reared its head back in <em>KOF '99</em>, with Kensou and Bao shown to be vessels for an otherworldly power coveted by the mysterious Ron (former leader of the Hizoku clan of assassins and a former member of NESTS, the villainous cartel of which <em>KOF</em>'s third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> centers on). Fast forward to <em>XI</em> and <em>XIII</em> and all we know is that Kensou has apparently mastered its powers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedYouStronger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedYouStronger">much to Ron's approval</a>) and Ron has unspecified ties to Those from the Past (as Saiki alludes to Ron having warned him of Kensou in their pre-boss fight dialogue). We know nothing of the Dragon Spirit's origins or why Ron has his sights on it, although it can be inferred that this has <em>something</em> to do with Ron's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIWasBornAndRazed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIWasBornAndRazed">betrayal of his clan</a>. This is mainly an effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">the plotline mostly being put on hold in lieu of Those from the Past's machinations</a>; with several Hizoku members being introduced to the cast since <em>2000</em> (including Ron's son Duo Lon, a semi-important supporting character from <em>2003</em> onward) and the Tales of Ash having come to a close with <em>XIII</em>, it's possible the next arc will finally revisit these story elements and elevate the ever-elusive Ron to main villain status.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> has a few, though many of them ended up being explored in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">Bonus Mission Pack</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series has thousands of years of backstory material that is only hinted at in the games, either through dialogue with various characters or in the many in-game books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> games have a lot of this kind of information that you can gather from the various NPCs or furniture in the various towns, regarding the political and economic situations of your surroundings, gossip about local leaders, what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">cuisine</a> and culture are like in each place (in some places extending to religious beliefs), optional content you can explore, and once in a while some obscure lore tangentially related to the plot.
<ul><li> <em>Dark Dawn</em> takes this a whole step further with the major characters themselves discussing some stuff in relatively major cutscenes that isn't at all involved in the plot of the game, like the three races of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a>, the modern geography and political unrest around Morgal and Bilibin, and Kraden's messenger pigeons. Fans were annoyed that this cut into plot and character development, which were less consistent than in the previous two games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has a lot of background material that isn't wholly relevant to the games' plot. Moreso in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">sequel</a> since the game takes place on a more personal level. Some particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder">interesting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">bits</a> of background are that the Primeval Thaig <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was apparently part of an ancient dwarven civilization predating the Deep Roads, which had temples and worshiped gods (and that the Primeval Thaig was ruled by a "dwarf so foul the Stone rejected him" and covered in evil red lyrium that drives people insane)</span>, that at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate">Eluvian</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leads to "another place - beyond this world, beyond the Fade"</span>, that Flemeth is, at least according to Morrigan, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> something other than merely a mage or an abomination</span>, and that the qunari must have arrived in Thedas (the continent where the games are set) from somewhere because they only showed up three hundred years ago, but no one knows where they came from.
<ul><li> More subtly, there is the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">Codex</a> business: in theory, it should offer exhaustive explanations and backstories of in-game events, items, and characters. However, in practice, one cryptic reference explanation contains three more references that <em>don't</em> get explained.
</li><li> The Warden can do this during <em>Witch Hunt</em>, only vaguely hinting to their new companions their precise relationship and reasons for searching for the Witch of the Wilds. Particularly noticable if Morrigan was romanced, where Ariane eventually comes to realise that the Wardens cryptic statement that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "She has my child"</span> didn't mean that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Morrigan had kidnapped their child</span> as she'd assumed, but actually because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Morrigan was the <em>mother</em> of their child.</span> Furthermore, she later figures out the nature of their relationship, asking the Warden if they are aware they subconsciously play with the ring on their finger when they think no-one is looking. After the Warden explains it's part of a pair shared with Morrigan, Ariane is genuinely amused when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">fervently deny</a> that this means they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">married.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>. A lot of the backstory involving dead civilizations and their predecessors from space but you only know (sparse) details from supplementary materials. Squaresoft was hoping to make sequels based on this information.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefIITheMetalAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefIITheMetalAge">Thief II: The Metal Age</a></em> During the missions, you occasionally hear and read references to "the Baron", who's absence has allowed Sheriff Truart to assert his dominance over the city. No detail is given about who the Baron is or why he is absent, but this little detail creates the feeling that the game is set in a small corner of a much larger world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a>,</em> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> series, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>, like Valve's games described above, almost entirely bereft of traditional exposition, and the story of each game must largely be pieced together and inferred from item descriptions, level design, and the like. There are occasional characters better informed than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> who will provide some precious information, but they generally prove untrustworthy.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> claims the inspiration for this style of storytelling came from him attempting to read Western fantasy novels as a teen despite having a limited grasp of English: he could only understand certain passages, many of which referred to objects or events described in passages he couldn't read, thus turning explained plot points into this trope.

In the regular story, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version of the game included extra missions in which Connor tries to stop Benedict Arnold from betraying West Point to the British, which were omitted from the others. In the DLC, which is set in an alternate timeline but with Connor aware of the events of the main story, he remarks that he finally got Arnold back for West Point when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he kills him at the end of the first chapter</span>. Arnold says that he has no idea what Connor is talking about, since in this timeline he never turned coat and thus never betrayed West Point. To Xbox and PC players who didn't get those missions, it comes off as a cryptic background reference, merely something that happened off-screen.
<ul><li> In the main game and some others, conversations can be overheard in towns—particularly from heralds—referring to real historical events, such as a town crier in <em>Assassin's Creed III</em> informing citizens of events taking place in Egypt that have no bearing on the story at all. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Brotherhood</a></em>—set in Renaissance Italy—a herald refers to the recent discovery of the New World and its native peoples.

As it is an MMO, some of these references became fodder for patches and the <em>Heavenward</em> expansion, which focuses on the Dragonsong War, a war between Ishgard's theocratic society and Dravania's dragon and brings more of these with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Warrior of Darkness and bits and pieces found in the Dusk Vigil and Azys Lla's museum</span>, the fallen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Allagin Empire</a> also stated out as such only to get some explanations with the Bonding Coil of Bahamut and Crystal Tower dungeons as well as the area of Azys Lla which explains how it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill">Soiled City on a Hill</a> and how its actions up to that point resulted in the Calamity much much later. In addition there are 7 Astral Eras and 7 Umbral Eras, the latter being caused by the end of a Golden Age. But only the events leading to the 4rd, 5th and 7th Umbral Eras (the latter being a transaction to and the time frame of the initial plot to A Realm Reborn) are known to the players, being the aforementioned fall of the Alagin Empire, the War of the Magi and the Calamity.

<ul><li> The Divergent Laws. References to weapons carried by Ouroboros have very rarely been described as having special properties granted to their wielders by the Grandmaster of Ourboros.

A quote by Loewe remains the only explanation we're given over the course of 8 games. "The sword granted to me by the Grandmaster. Just like your staff. It's a demon sword forged through the Divergent Laws."

</li><li> The Great Collapse is mentioned by characters to be what caused the downfall of the ancient Zemurian civilization, but more than 14 years of games later and it's still unexplained what this was, exactly.

<ul><li> One of the most well-known examples is the original dragon that was split into the Tao Trio. We don't know what it looked like, as it's not possible to restore it.
</li><li> The Legendary Beast trio were brought back to life by Ho-Oh. We don't know what they were originally before being resurrected.
</li><li> Shellder has an alternative evolution that can clearly be seen on Slowbro's tail and Slowking's head, but is not capturable by the player by itself. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qmd4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qmd4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qmd4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">: It may even come in two different forms because there are visible differences between the one on Slowbro's tail and the one on Slowking's head; the former has eyes, and the latter a gem </span> A leaked demo revealed it was originally programed in as an attainable Pokémon separate from the Slowpoke line, but was removed for a unknown reason.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Cara Liss</a> restores some fossil Pokémon for the player. However, she does it by frankensteining the front half and back half of separate species, the result depending on what exactly you give her. (This is a reference/joke on how in real-life early paleontologists mismatched bones, especially in Britain where this region is based, incidentally she's wearing mismatched shoes and has mud on her face). For some reason the game does not allow you to obtain these Pokemon in their correct, original complete state, although there is plenty of speculative fanon and fanart.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ppqq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ppqq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ppqq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">: One is believed to be based on a raptor, another a plesiosaur, one a stegosaurus, and the last is a fish </span>
</li><li> Kangaskhan are always seen with babies in their pouch. These are clearly its pre-evo, but they are not obtainable separately by the player.
</li><li> Genesect is a fossil Pokémon bought back to life and altered to have a cannon on its back. What it looked like in its original state is unknown.
</li><li> Many fossil Pokémon are part Rock-types. It's not officially confirmed, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> is that many of these Pokémon gained the Rock-type because of being resurrected from fossils, and that in their original state, their types and thus, forms, were different.
</li><li> Arbok is noted to have more than 20 variations of the markings on its body. Some of these can be seen in different games as unofficial form differences, but not all of them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> does this a lot, helping to give the sense that it's an alternate history defined by the presence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad scientists</a>.
<ul><li> Among the more notable are references to what things were like before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Baron Wulfenbach</a> took over Europe, what the places ruled by less pleasant Sparks are like, and the fact that there are multiple popes.
</li><li> Occasionally they'll also drop and/or hide names we're familiar with in places we can spot them, showing how those individuals are different in this version of history (the most prominent one is actually reasonably well known, but he's addressed by his surname where we the reader are typically familiar with his given name alone). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's Rembrandt <em>van Rijn</em>.</span>

</li><li> A side story taking place after the main story does this. We know Agatha is settled in as the Heterodyne and Mechanicsburg is safe, but everything else is left quite vague. The Empire is referenced in a way that implies Mechanicsburg has to worry about their laws, but it's deliberately unclear who is in charge of it, what Agatha's relationship to them is, and how that relates to Mechanicsburg. The Storm King isn't even mentioned, but it could be his empire they're talking about instead of the Wulfenbach one.
</li></ul></li><li> One story arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheInexplicableAdventuresOfBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheInexplicableAdventuresOfBob">The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!</a></em> involved a lot of clarification of throwaway details like this from earlier in the series. We've finally seen Butane the planet of dragons; we've gotten a minimally technobabblish explanation of what borfomite actually does; we've seen some court intrigue in the Nemesite Empire; Fructose Riboflavin is finally looking competent enough to explain how he got his terrifying reputation; etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DresdenCodak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DresdenCodak">Dresden Codak</a></em> engages in this from time to time.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheMansionOfE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheMansionOfE">The Mansion of E</a></em> often makes passing reference to things in distant parts of the Mansion's home country and continent.

So there are references to superheroes and super-teams we haven't met yet, and supervillains who are 'A-level threats' according to an international scale we haven't had explained either, and also tons of references to real-world things to show how close that universe it to ours. Some of these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>.

Whether or not they're just building up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmoury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmoury">Chekhov's Armoury</a>, though, remains to be seen.

</li><li> The earlier volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> were full of references. Some of them deliberate hooks, others the result of difficulty dropping exposition about things the characters already knew. Most of the latter got filled in later on, but the series has so far kept up a supply of new hooks to replace things that are explained.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DreamComeTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DreamComeTrue">Dream Come True</a></em>, the animals all live like normal (talking) farm animals. Yet, the horses mention the "Gypsy King" (who seems to be from another farm) and imply some sort of international society involving Gypsy Vanners. The farm animals act like they live in a kingdom, but none of this is ever clarified.

The actual nature of it wasn't even discussed at all until halfway through the series, but it was easily inferred to be some sort of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> that somehow turned the world into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a> <em>somehow</em> before any explanation began to be given.

</li><li> Similarly, a lot of the superheroes and supervillains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> just show up with their origins unexplained (and often never explained) as well; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, Red Tornado, Vixen, Gypsy, Star Sapphire, Copperhead, Black Manta, and Doctor Polaris are just a few examples.

Nothing is known about it except it was the last battle between the first Batman and Ra's al Ghul where Talia finally betrayed him for good. No other details are known about it, and so it has become a popular subject whenever fans demand more closure to the DCAU, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they never really planned to cover the event in any of the animated shows, and at this point it does not seem like they ever will.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> has the dual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> Josephine and Ezekiel Clench frequently referring to "that boy from Kansas City" and talking as if he had put up the fight of their lives. Considering the two of them gave Jack the most trouble of any group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunters</a>, this boy from Kansas City had to have been an equal to Jack or close to him.

<ul><li> The show is always making reference to things that happened in the past that involved Gems, in particular the Great Gem War for Earth. While the cause and purpose are eventually explained as the Crystal Gems splitting off from Homeworld, many of the fine details are only vaguely alluded to, leaving thousands of years of history to explore. Additionally, many hints about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> shaped by Gems are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">brief images the camera's quick to pull away from</a>.

Aside from Earth, there's a mentioned fifteen additional Warps that have been severely damaged, with nary a hint as to their names and possible native species.

Where these come from no one knows. Also, the planet they live on is called Third Earth, and unlike in the original series, this one is heavily implied to not be our Earth, which means there must be a second earth. It's also implied that technology once existed in abundance even before Mumm-Ra's pyramid crashed there, which means it could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>.

Where did it come from? We don't know.
</li><li> Originally used, then later became a subversion during the pilot of <em>Beast Wars</em>. Optimus Primal references "the Great War". Since this series was originally not meant to be too closely connected to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">first generation</a>, this was more of a lore reference for long-time fans of the franchise, and this trope for everyone else. As the series went on and the creators decided to make the G1 connection more explicit, the original intent faded.

How and when the Guild started is also kind of vague but it's implied that it was formed by or because of Dr Ventures father or grandfather.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> manages to do this in a different way: back stories and origins often go unexplained, but will still be referenced.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz">Trollz</a></em> episode "Forever Amber" mentions the ancient Troll village of Angermore, who used their magic for evil but disappeared without explanation.
