The foe is surely doomed. However, the foe has set up a superior plan, one that makes the first plan look pathetic. In short, the first plan has been Out-Gambitted.
</p><p>This trope specifically has three parts:
</p><ol><li> Alice makes Plan A.
</li><li> Bob makes Plan B in response.
</li><li> Plan A goes down in flames.
</li></ol><p>Or alternatively:

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hohenheim manages to completely undo Father's transformation of everyone in Amestris into a philosopher's stone using a transmutation circle <em>made from the shadow of the solar eclipse</em>. And this was possible because Father's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> required that solar eclipse. Furthermore, Hohenheim's allies undo the seal Father put on everyone else's alchemy by using <em>Father's own transmutation circle</em></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is this trope. <em>Every duel</em> seems to boil down to "Who will Out-Gambit who?". All players use their cards and strategies, putting a gambit against enemies and sometimes two duelists can be Out-Gambitted multiple times in the same duel. Yami Yugi's duels are almost always about how his gambit destroys his enemy's gambit.
<ul><li> Here's an example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">5D's</a></em> done by Yusei. Yusei has on his field nothing except two face-down cards, against Greiger/Bommer's Flying Fortress SKYFIRE/Giant Bomber AIRRAID. If SKYFIRE's attack goes through, then Yusei will lose - and SKYFIRE allows Greiger to destroy a card on the field once per turn by discarding a card. Greiger decides not to destroy either one, speculating that it's actually a ploy to make him deplete his hand uselessly. It turns out he's right: the two cards are Wasteland Tornado and Limiter Break. If Wasteland Tornado is destroyed while set, Yusei would be able to destroy a face-up card - in this case, SKYFIRE. If Limiter Break is sent to the Graveyard, Yusei can Special Summon Speed Warrior to protect against SKYFIRE's attack. But since Greiger doesn't destroy either card, Yusei reveals that was covered, too: he activates Wasteland Tornado <em>himself</em> to destroy his own Limiter Break and get Speed Warrior to intercept the attack.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens incredibly often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. Technically Yusuke's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">death</span> falls in this category, along with Jaki's attempt at turning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuwabara</span> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Dark Side</a>, possibly for a stronger host, Yusuke outwitting Goki (with little difficulty) and then later Hiei, back when they first met, Kurama's fight with Roto, Kurama outwitting Kaito (although that was technically <em>supposed</em> to happen), Sensui and Toguro both getting their way despite the team's actions...there's also the fight between Yusuke and Kibano, who used a mask that shut out the other senses to focus on sensing spirit energy and used it to fight Yusuke in the dark. The mask however is also the reason Kibano was unable to see or smell the cigarette Yusuke put on him to find him in the darkness.
</li><li> Dio to Jotaro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> In part 3, Dio launched a barrage of knives against Jotaro, which made him fall quite a long distance. Knowing Jotaro was probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a>, he decided to chop his head off with a stop sign. Too bad that's just what Jotaro wanted, because he got a free hit while Dio was closing in. Earlier, Jotaro successfully Out-Gambitted D'Arby in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighStakesGame">poker game,</a> where the stakes were the souls of him, Joseph, and Polnareff - the boy that Jotaro choose to give the cards was working for D'Arby, and gave Jotaro weak cards, but Jotaro refused to look at them, making D'Arby think that he had switched them, and added too much to the stakes, with the possibility that losing would equal D'Arby's death, playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> that made D'Arby break down.
</li><li> Every fight in <em>Jojo</em>, considering that it's a series where intelligence goes far beyond strength, results in one of the fighters being Out-Gambitted, such as Joseph's battle with Esdisi in part 2.
</li><li> One of the earliest examples lies in part 1, when Dio planned to have Johnathan cut him in order to take hold of and freeze him. Johnathan Out-Gambitted him by cutting him at an area with the tip of his sword at the torch that allowed him to defrost himself.
</li><li> Joseph Joestar's epic chariot battle against Wham/Wamuu. Every tactic one fighter used was immediately countered by the other, with Joseph barely prevailing in the end.
</li><li> In Part 4, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Angelo</a> pulled a Batman Gambit, predicting Josuke would choose to break through a specific wall in his house to escape Angelo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Aqua Necklace.</a> so he set a humidifier into overdrive behind that specific wall. Aqua Necklace successfully entered Josuke's body...and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Josuke</a> revealed he had shredded and swallowed a rubber glove. One use of Crazy Diamond, and Aqua Necklace was trapped.
</li></ul></li><li> This describes every match in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi">Akagi</a></em>; Akagi manipulates everyone around him (even people who are watching the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong">Mahjong</a> games from the outside) as they think they have him cornered.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Hunter Exam arc, Gon is engaged in a game of choice: he has to keep one of two candles lit in a windy room for longer than his examiner can do the same. As such, he picks the longer one, but the examiner actually has <em>four</em> candles, two of which are rigged to burn quickly. However, because it burns so strongly, he's able to leave it unattended to blow out his opponent's candle.
</li><li> Another test involves the room where they must leave two people behind or take the long road. The team loses 50 hours in a gambling match just after the above example, so they have about 2 hours left, one route which only 3 of the five can travel down takes 5 minutes, the other route takes about 12 hours. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">solution</a> Gon sees is to choose the long route, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">break through the wall</a> to the short route, then stop for just long enough to slide down the hill on a door...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the group make it to the finish with less than a second to spare.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shikamaru Nara pulls this off quite a lot. All of his battles involve him making his opponent so sure of their victory that they inevitably screw up and fall to his masterfully-laid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>.
</li><li> Sasuke (take a deep breath) thought that Itachi killed his clan out of hatred, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he really did care about him and he was ordered to by the Konoha elder Danzo, who was than revealed to have been manipulated by Tobi, who had also manipulated Pain into becoming evil. Sasuke was then manipulated by Orochimaru to steal his body, but Sasuke saw through this and was met up by Tobi, who revealed that he was responsible for the Uchiha clan massacre by unleashing Kurama on Konoha, causing Sasuke to kill Danzo and then target Konoha, but then Kabuto blackmailed Tobi by resurrecting the real Madara, whom Tobi had impersonated. Itachi was resurrected by Kabuto as well, but then he defeated him and sealed his own soul away, but then Madara revealed he had caused the death of Rin, which caused Tobi to become evil as he was originally Obito and Madara placed a seal on Tobi's heart which prevented him from becoming the Ten Tails Jinchuuriki in case he tried to sidestep Madara on the plan. Later, Madara tried to force Tobi into restoring his natural body, but actually Tobi foresaw this and previously got rid of seal Madara had placed in order to become the Ten Tails Jinchuuriki. But later, when Tobi is defeated by Naruto and the Alliance, Madara pulls out of Edo Tensei with the help of Black Zetsu. Orochimaru, Sasuke, and Tobi (still struggling with Black Zetsu) then try to help everyone else by defeating Madara. Black Zetsu is revealed to have been a manifestation of Princess Kaguya's (who was the first human to use chakra whom Madara was descended from who in turn incapacitates him) will.</span> Whew.

He proceeds to instantly kill Aizen with his Bankai's true power, making Aizen experience true fear for the first time in his life.

</li><li> The Washimine yakuza clan ended up with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>.
<ul><li> To start, they attempted to make an alliance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">Hotel Moscow</a>, with hopes that they'll take care of their enemies. Hotel Moscow sends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch">Balalaika</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a> to help them. Her brutal tactics against Washimine's other Yakuza rivals quickly spiral out of control and the Washimine head attempts to assassinate Balalaika... Big mistake. The head got his neck snapped by Balalaika herself and with this Casus Belli in hand, Hotel Moscow allies with the rest of the Yakuza Council against Washimine and begins destroying them piecemeal.
</li><li> Yukio, a high school girl and the lead's last relative, takes control over the clan and manages to restore some semblance of fighting strength and strikes back, taking out the local head of Hotel Moscow... Who was one of Balalaika's hated rivals. Since Balalaika's troops are made of former Soviet Airborne Troops who fought at Afghanistan and can <em>start and win World War III</em>, Balalaika quickly fights with much more cunning and brutality, which almost completely destroy Washimine...
</li><li> Once this is done, Balalaika <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">uses the guise of her new alliance to murder the heads of the entire rest of the council</a>, throwing the entire Tokyo underworld into all-out chaos and giving Hotel Moscow carte blanche to move in and seize control. Which had been Balalaika's objective all along, and she outplayed at least three other factions in the process. Once she realized that Balalaika had won the war, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yukio's bodyguard and most faithful supporter Ginji died in a duel with Revy</span>, Yukio chose to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commit suicide rather than giving Balalaika the ultimate laugh</span>. It wasn't better that Washimine clan itself suffered a civil war between those who supported Yukio and those who supported Chaka, which finished when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chaka was brutally slain by Ginji for kidnapping Yukio, beating her bloody, sexually humiliating her via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip">stripping her almost naked</a>, intending to sell her into sex slavery, <em>and</em> trying to use her as a human shield</span>.

We have Seele who's trying to manipulate everyone into activating Instrumentality, we have Gendo trying to reunite with his wife Yui, the angels who plan on reuniting with Adam, and later Ritsuko who plots to kill Gendo and stop his plans due to how he used her.

This ends up altering reality and effectively rewriting the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> system so that magical girls will no longer turn into witches, leaving Kyuubey to gather energy from sources <em>other</em> than the broken dreams of young girls like Madoka and her "teammates".</span>

</li><li> The Buu Arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> is full of gambits and plans that end up being nullified by even <em>superior</em> gambits and plans. Probably the <em>worst</em> example was when Super Buu demanded seeing the "Strong Fighter"/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gotenks (Goten and Trunks fused together)</span> he was promised by Goku, and in an effort to buy more time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Piccolo suggests that Buu amuse himself by terrorizing the people of Earth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">knowing they can be revived with the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Dragon Balls</a>. Despite Majin Buu's previous rampage there were still <em>billions</em> of humans left on earth so Piccolo thought that with that many humans left it would take Super Buu at least a few hours to fly across the world and terrorize every single one of them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Super Buu instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">kills every single human</a>, with the exception of Mr. Satan, Tien, Chiaotzu and all those present on Kami's Lookout, in only <strong>two minutes</strong> and <em>never left Kami's Lookout while doing it.</em> All of humanity had essentially become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb">Sacrificial Lamb</a> for the sake of giving Goten and Trunks just two more minutes of time to train</span>. It's safe to say that Piccolo's plan of trying to outsmart Super Buu to gain more time backfired on him <em>tremendously</em>. <em>Every time</em> the heroes would come up with a plan of defeating Super Buu, Super Buu would just outplay them or outsmart them. Another example would be when Piccolo destroyed the only exit of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber forever trapping himself, Gotenks and Super Buu in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. What does Super Buu do? <em>He rips a hole through dimensions by screaming</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">though it should be noted that this had no planning whatsoever</a> and he was just <em>really</em> angry at being denied sweets) and escapes the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, leaving Gotenks and Piccolo trapped inside while he turns the rest of the Z-Fighters into candy and then eats them.

Super Buu instead <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">turns Vegito into a jawbreaker</a></em>. Vegito then uses his new form to <strong>kick Super Buu's ass</strong>. Vegito then points out that being turned into candy actually works as an advantage to him because he is extremely fast and far too small for Super Buu to hit and also retains all of his power because he's so much stronger than Super Buu.

Feeling that he could do more good from the bridge of the Imperial Star Destroyer <em>Reprisal</em> than if he jumped ship to seek out the Alliance, he waited until Darth Vader himself came aboard to oversee the capture of several Rebel groups by Commander Demmings.

Once again, he ordered Demmings to neutralize the enemy without killing them, and Demmings ordered the best gunner, Dox, to make the shot.

<ul><li> If you pay attention to the Man in Black's challenge, he says "Where is the poison? The contest ends when you choose and we drink." In other words, under the literal rules of the game, even if Vizzini had figured out they were both poisoned, he still would have drank and died.

</li><li> Really, the whole scene is Vizzini trying several different gambits. First, he tries probing for information, trying to get Westley to unknowingly give away some hint of which cup is poisoned. (The book version of Westley does start becoming agitated and concerned that Vizzini may figure out the whole setup, while the movie version stays cool and lets Vizzini ramble away and go on tangents.) When that fails, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBehindYou">gets Westley to look away</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedChaliceSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedChaliceSwitcheroo">then switches the cups</a>. Before drinking, he carefully watches Westley's reaction to see if there's any hesitation on Westley's part. When Westley doesn't hesitate to drink, Vizzini figures that Westley <em>thought</em> that he was reaching for the "safe" cup, but due to Vizzini switching the cups, now Vizzini has the safe cup. Had Westley hesitated, Vizzini would have inferred that he was now holding the poisoned cup and tossed it aside. Of course instead Westley had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfPoisoningGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfPoisoningGambit">poisoned both cups</a> and was exploiting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredPoisonImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredPoisonImmunity">Acquired Poison Immunity</a>.

<ul><li> Even earlier, the Atreides were themselves victim of this when they knowingly walked into the Harkonnen trap on Arrakis, counting on their superior training and potential alliance with the Fremen to see them through. What Leto failed to realize was that the Emperor was backing the Harkonnens and the sheer amount of money both were willing to spend to defeat him.

Paul, of course, has anticipated this, but it's the loyalty of the ghola Duncan Idaho, whom they were counting on to either kill Paul (forcing Alia to make the same choice) or recover his memories, showing Paul what could be achieved with Chani, that allows Paul to evade the trap.

Then Kelsier out-gambits the Lord Ruler in order to kill him. Ruin out-gambits everyone again to get Vin to go to the Well of Ascension and free him. After that it turns out that the Lord Ruler had prepared for the possibility of his death and Ruin's release and prepared storage places for people to hide to protect them, and hid the atium stockpile, which contained most of Ruin's power where Ruin couldn't get at it. Then it turns out that Preservation had planned for everything, in spite of having had most of his mind destroyed when he trapped Ruin thousands of years before, and he managed to get Elend and his army to destroy the atium stockpile, keeping the power away from Ruin, meanwhile he'd also arranged for Vin to take his power, and perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to kill Ruin.</span>.

<ul><li> In <em>Ahriman: Exile</em>, Ahriman, having learned that his unseen enemy is his old ally Amon, travels to a desolate space station and summons a powerful daemon in order to question it about Amons plans. Amon predicted that Ahriman would summon that specific daemon, however, and pre-emptively bound it into his service. When Ahriman summons the daemon, it easily breaks free of his control and unleashes a horde of lesser daemons upon the station, forcing Ahriman and his allies to flee for their lives.
</li><li> In <em>Ahriman: Sorcerer</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Ahrimans lieutenant Sanakht</a> conspires with Ignis to kill Ahriman and take control of his Chaos Space Marine warband.

Sanakht knows the Athenaeum is guarded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">blanks</a>, which will prevent Ahriman from defending himself with his sorcery and give Sanakht (who is the better swordsman) a chance to kill him. Unfortunately for Sanakht, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ignis is loyal to Ahriman and has not only kept his master informed of the plot, but also fed the conspirators misinformation so that they will fire on each other instead of Ahrimans loyalists during the coup. Ahrimans own plans also <em>require</em> the destruction of his flagship, as this will tear open a Warp rift and let the warband escape from the Inquisitorial fleet that is pursuing them. Finally, Ahriman needs someone to act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">vessel</a> for the Athenaeum, and by letting it possess Sanakht, hes killing two birds with one stone</span>.

</div></li><li> Wilson is the only one who ever really matches House, in fact he pulls off one of these himself in "Safe" where House plays a series of practical jokes on him in the hopes of getting him to respond. Wilson stoically takes it all without complaint and House seems to give up, then at the very end of the episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">House's cane snaps in two and he falls flat on his ass. Wilson deadpans that "someone" must have sawn halfway through his cane during the night</span>.
<div class="indent"><em>You magnificent bitch. You just invoked the name of your dead girlfriend to play me? You're my hero.</em> (From "Saviors", when House finally realizes Wilson's been screwing with him the entire episode.)
</div></li><li> In another episode, both House and the audience are led to believe that the pranks are being played first by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Foreman and his ex-con brother, in a bonding ritual,</span> and then by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucas, in an effort to force House and Wilson out of Cuddy's dream home</span>. At the very end of the episode, after House declines to get revenge on whom he thinks is the prankster, Wilson simply says "I win."
</li><li> A season six episode depicts Foreman observing Thirteen wearing a magnificent watch and Chase driving an awesome car that they felt like "treating themselves to." This leads Foreman to conclude that everyone else on the team is making more than him, despite his position as a senior fellow. When he goes to Cuddy and tries to bluff his way into raising his salary by threatening to leave for another hospital, the team starts to worry that Foreman might actually quit. When Foreman leaves for a job that doesn't exist, the team appeals to Cuddy to hire him back, saying it was all a ploy on their part to stop Foreman from acting like such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">affected twit</a> (The watch and the car were both borrowed from friends). After agreeing to bring Foreman back, reduce the team's salary, and add it to Foreman's, she tells them that she has no idea what they're talking about, and hasn't seen or spoken with Foreman in four days. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Cue Foreman's appearance right outside Cuddy's office, smug smile and all.</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Foreman:</strong> The phrase... "Who's ya daddy?" comes to mind.
</div></li><li> This occurs in the season 8 episode "Chase", surprisingly on House against Taub. Throughout most of the episode, House is constantly attempting to successfully ambush Taub, who's been taking self defense classes, and Taub is shown to be surprisingly adept at reacting to whatever House throws at him. He also reveals, however, that constantly being on guard against House's attacks forces him to try to think three steps ahead of House; in one scene, House assigns Taub to "obviously fraudulent lab work" so that he'd know exactly where Taub would be at the time so he could leap out and blast him with a squirt gun (and as a bonus, he'd get to watch Taub's paranoia at work beforehand, watching him look in all the wrong places for the oncoming attack.) After he leaps out and fires, however, it turns out Taub already rigged the squirt gun to misfire, and instead it squirts at House's own face.

He knows every single con they pull to the point of knowing exactly which algorithm Hardison will use to hack a hydroelectric plant's computer.

He does all this, since any contract Draper was working under would definitely have a clause restricting him from taking clients with him should he leave the firm. The hitch in Duck's plan? Don <em>doesn't have a contract at all</em>.

Then Peele writes a memo that clearly displays him to be unfit for the job, and Burnside has to go back to Wellingham and walk back everything he's said, and Wellingham reveals that he knew all along what Burnside was up to, had already made the decision to appoint Gibbs, and had maneuvered Peele into writing the memo in order to convince Burnside that he wasn't a suitable candidate.

However, after their opening barrage, they find out the planet is deserted and there are 150 Jem'Hadar warships screaming out of the nearby nebula. Turns out the changelings had known about the plan and deliberately allowed them to walk into a trap, Battle of Midway style. A changeling had even replaced the Romulan commander to ensure their own success. While the Tal Shiar eventually recover, the Order is annihilated and the Cardassian Central Command is overthrown shortly thereafter.

Then he arrives on his own, claiming to be a defector and to have always known about the transporter trick and never told his men. Together, he and Janeway make great headway in finding the wormhole, but before the work is completed he has to return to his crew to keep them being ineffectual and prevent them becoming suspicious. He then returns in an official capacity and, with his second-in-command out of the room, asks Janeway if she's located the wormhole.

<ul><li> In the sixth season finale, Castiel and Crowley have a simple plan: open the door to Purgatory and harvest the power of all the souls within. Castiel (being the more powerful of the two) decides to cut Crowley out of the deal at the last minute, and take all the power for himself. Very quickly, this starts to look like a bad decision on Castiel's part, because Crowley immediately seeks out and 'defects' to Castiel's most powerful enemy: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael">Archangel Raphael</a>. Crowley offers Raphael the original deal and together, Raphael and Crowley force Castiel to flee, leaving behind all the ingredients for the spell. - Unfortunately for Crowley and Raphael, Castiel wasn't taken by surprise at all. What he left behind include a fake version of one ingredient; something rare, hard to get, and crucial to the spell. He'd already hidden the real item away somewhere else. While Raphael and Crowley waste their time trying to cast a spell that can never work, Castiel is able to complete his work without threat or interruption. By the time he finishes, he's pretty much the most powerful being in the Supernatural universe. Only God, and probably Death, are stronger. Raphael doesn't fare very well after that.
</li><li> All the Winchesters have managed to successfully pull this on occasion. Henry, John and Sam are all pretty good, but the really master has to be Dean. More often than not, Dean manages to defeat what ever being of much greater strength, power or intelligence (or all three) he is up against, but making them think they are winning. 9/10 if Dean is surrendering, losing his cool and acting irrationally or seemingly being defeated badly, you're five seconds away from him defeating them in one big master stroke.
