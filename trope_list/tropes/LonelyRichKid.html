</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>A noticeable shortage of close friends</em>, for various reasons. They could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>, or at least mistaken for one. The character may be leery of friendship overtures because these have turned out to be attempts to take advantage of their wealth. Then there are the rich parents of the rich kid to consider. It could be that parental pressure is toward the character becoming remote and icy because that's what worked for them, all that caste and class nonsense. Politicians' and tycoons' kids often have anti-kidnapping barriers around them that friendlies have just as hard a time getting through as do the unfriendlies.
</li><li> <em>Some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>.</em> Mom and Dad will be either a) dead, b) never around, c) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">inattentive and uncaring</a>, d) inhumanly demanding to the exclusion of actual <em>parenting</em>, or e) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">overwhelmed with all the other responsibilities they need to handle</a> or f) some combination of the above.

Wealth and intelligence often go hand in hand and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">Intelligence = Isolation</a>. God help if the lonely rich kid is also intelligent! Even with all his wealth, a rich <em>and</em> intelligent kid feels alien in his world and among his lesser intellectually endowed peers. His wealth <em>may even exacerbate</em> the situation, turning mere scorn and anti-intellectualism into <em>active hate</em>.
</li></ul><p>This one-two punch serves up a lonely kid, one with resources. Unhappy kid + money = trouble, more often than not.

However, he is also most likely more screwed up as well considering the fact that said best friend that betrayed him lied to him about <em>her</em> gender and is apparently in love with him. It also doesn't help that they have an agreement between their families for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a></span>.
</li><li> Farnese from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>. Her older siblings were generations apart, her father was always away on business, and her mother took no role in parenting since she was always out partying. Thus, Farnese developed some, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">problems</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">and urges</a>) due to a sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>, and would terrorize her servants and kill pets that didn't reach her expectations. This wasn't made any better when she was given a military position whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">purpose was to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burn people at the stake...</a> Princess Charlotte and Theresia count as well, though Princess Charlotte has fared a bit better since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">she had one friend in her maid Anna</a> and Theresia was at least okay when Puck came around and cheered her up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">until her whole childhood was destroyed</a>. Basically, if you're an aristocratic female in <em>Berserk</em>, your life is going to be an emotional mess.
</li><li> Yukari Fujioka from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BillionaireGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BillionaireGirl">Billionaire Girl</a></em> is a self-made example. She's an 18-year-old day trader who has successfully amassed a 170 billion yen fortune, but feels ashamed of her Otaku passion for the business and pretends to be a normal university student, as well as having difficulty making friends because of her wealth.

A large part of it is due to the other girls being jealous of her due to her good looks, grades, athleticism, and ample cleavage. As a result, she was often shunned by other girls in group activities, to the point that she had no real friends prior to joining the Neighbors Club.
</li><li> Takami "Komo" Komoda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, especially in the manga. Her father is a high ranked military man, so in grade school, Komo either was ignored or ostracized by the other kids until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Maki Anou</a> came along. As a result, she grew very aloof and slightly emotionally detached from the world.
</li><li> The F4 boys from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em> display this trope in <em>very</em> different ways.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> is cited by other characters as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for bullying/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">complete lack of respect for anyone</a>/borderline psychopathic fits of rage.

</li><li> Hanazawa Rui is referred to as having an <em>extremely</em> strict childhood that left him prone to fits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">near-catatonia</a> as a child. This was eventually "cured" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> in the form of his old friend and later girlfriend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> Shizuka Todou, but it left him emotionally dependent on her.
</li><li> Nishikado Sohjirou seems at first to be immune from this, but as more of his home life is revealed, he is shown to have parents who are highly emotionally distant and an older brother who abandoned the family business, leaving him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon">The Dutiful Son</a>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">assumed to be the cause of his inability</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">to develop lasting relationships</a>.
</li><li> Mimasaka Akira seems to be the only member immune from this despite that, at least in the j-Drama, his father is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> boss.

<ul><li> El Si Pierre is the son of a French nobleman and tycoon <a class="urllink" href="http://mangafox.me/manga/captain_tsubasa/v32/c099/103.html">who used to be either bullied or sucked up to for his family's riches and prestige.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> He began practising soccer to avert this problem since, in his view, soccer rules are the same for everyone, and this let him forge real friendships with time.
</li><li> Mark Owairan is a <em>real</em> Arabian prince who spent several years locked inside his father's palace and discovered soccer only when he went out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">Gilded Cage</a> with his bodyguards and saw a bunch of children playing in the streets. He was so fascinated that he started training and playing, rising to the top thanks to his own merits and not to his family's influences.
</li><li> The first anime strongly implies that Genzo Wakabayashi is one. He lives in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a> but his family is nowhere in sight, the only adult he interacts regularly with is his coach and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> Mikami, and a later episode states that his parents are in London (probably due to his father's work) so one of Wakabayashi's reasons to move to Germany is being closer to them.

While he's more or less well-regarded in his school class, he has very few close friends (barring Meiling from the anime). Tomoyo apparently had some shares of this until Sakura befriended her.

<ul><li> An episode of the first season brings up the kidnapping and murder of a high school girl named Naoko Takei, who happened to be Shinichi and Ran's classmate.

Takei was actually such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> that he didn't really care for poor Naoko's safety, having given a ransom money <em>that was all fake</em>... which Akiko brutally calls him out on when she tries to kill him <em>and</em> herself as revenge. She even states that she probably would've abandoned the whole plan if he had cared enough to use real money. And in a glorious payback moment, as soon as she was released Naoko ignored her father calling out to her, ran to Akiko <em>and forgave her</em> for everything, leaving Takei with his hands empty.</span>
</li><li> Shinichi himself counts to a degree. His parents do love him, but they spend much more time in the USA than in Japan and, until he got shrunk and went to live with the Mouris, they left him alone in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Occurs in the backstory of Lucy Heartfilia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>. After her mother Layla's death, she was raised by the staff of her family's manor, as her father Jude, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a> executive he is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">had no time for her</a>.

</li><li> Takiko Okuda aka Genbu no Miko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugiGenbuKaiden">Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden</a></em>. Also Hotohori, as the son of the former Emperor of Konan and his mistress/the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>. He later is orphaned and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a> himself, which makes him <em>even lonelier</em> - so he latches on the legend of the Suzaku No Miko and falls for Miaka when she treats him as a person and not as the leader of the country.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Miho had difficulty making friends as a child because no one else shared her interest in tankery.
</li><li> Ayumi Himekawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> is the rich daughter of two successful actors and is set on the path to follow in their footsteps. She has a lot of peers around telling her how great she is, but no real true friends. It's revealed later on that she was jealous of ordinary Maya Kitajima, not only because of her being naturally good at acting but because she had true friends by her side encouraging her, while Ayumi had nothing but pressure to live up to her family's legacy, which made her feel alone.
</li><li> Extra points for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nanako's parents started out poor and nice and became less pleasant as they got rich. The protagonist solves the family problem without bankrupting them, however. With a sledgehammer.
</li><li> A number of characters including Urumi and Miyabi fit the bill as well. While their parents aren't gone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except Urumi, who doesn't know her father as anything more than a sperm donor</span>, they're emotionally detached from them to the point they act out. Granted they have more issues than just this trope, but <em>GTO</em> prefers a cornucopia of issues for its characters.
</li><li> Another one of the minor characters that Onizuka helps is the son of a Yakuza boss who has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HikkikoMori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HikkikoMori">Hikkiko Mori</a> because he didn't want to be ostracized by his peers because of his dad. (Later, he gets over it, and uses the fact that Daddy is in the Yakuza as a leverage point against bullies.)
</li></ul></li><li> Nagi Sanzennin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> pretty much gets hit full force by all aspects of this trope. Her parents are mentioned sometimes, but are practically nonexistent (both of them died when she was little). She's hesitant to even go outside her own house because every time she does, somebody tries to kidnap her for her wealth. Pretty much her only friends are fellow Lonely Rich Kids, the servants she keeps around (including Hayate), and her pet tiger Tama. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Athena Tennos</span> is another, <em>especially</em> in her backstory <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">More exactly, when she kicks Hayate out after their fight but almost immediately falls into despair due to being magically locked in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">Gilded Cage</a>-like mansion.</span>

Lampshaded when she reveals her loneliness <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that led her to be possessed by a demon</span> to Makoto and Nuubee and says it's one of the reasons is how she can't make true friends.

</li><li> Usami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica">Junjou Romantica</a></em>, until meeting Hiroki. His mother is shown as highly distant, his father is more or less not present, and his half-brother constantly jealous of him. Misaki says to him "You've got the typical rich boy complex. Am I right? You grew up with a father who was never home and abandoned his parental responsibilities, while your mother indulged herself in her own hobbies. Thus, in your loneliness, you found companionship in my older brother who was in the same boat. You lived life without ever finding true understanding, and hence you strayed from the right path but found nothing but more loneliness. And on top of that, you own a red sports car and a longhaired dog named Alexander!" To which Usagi replies, "How did you know?"
</li><li> Kaguya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>.

It also doesn't help that her family actively encourages her to become a cold-hearted manipulator.
</li><li> Serge Battour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta">Kaze to Ki no Uta</a></em>, who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartwarmingOrphan">Heartwarming Orphan</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> exaggerates this into parody. The Mankanshoku family is happy despite their poverty, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing">Horrible Housing</a> means they share every meal and are crowded snugly together. Once-lonely Ryuko enjoys the closeness of her new family. However, Mako's success as a club president catapults her family up the social ladder. Within one episode they go from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> and live in a vast mansion. They are also leading lives of luxury and hedonism, too busy to share meals. Ryuko sadly eats dinner by herself at a huge table, lonely again and missing poverty. She is even disappointed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArentYouGoingToRavishMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArentYouGoingToRavishMe">boys are not around to play Peeping Tom</a> as she changes. Once Mako realizes how miserable they have become she renounces her high status, thereby hitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> that sends her family back to their impoverished (but happy) life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em> has Haruka, whose family apparently came from a landed gentry family. Although the reason for her loneliness was her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathic</a> powers, which among others made her friendless and caused both of her parents to disown her.

Not to mention her status as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a bastard child</span>, making many people avoid her.

Even her beloved father is (unwillingly) distant due to his <em>extremely</em> demanding job, and while Relena herself understands it she can't help being depressed.

</li><li> Sabo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a partial case. He grew up in a rich noble family and states to his orphan friends that even though he had parents, he felt more lonely than them.

<ul><li> The most notable example is, of course, the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero">Oz Vessalius</a>, who starts out this way. His mother is dead, he has an emotionally abusive father who avoids visiting him because he hates him, and he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a>. In the beginning, his only friend is his valet Gilbert. Things get <em>a lot worse</em> involving Oz's father, but anything more would include massive spoilers.
</li><li> Gilbert himself also counts once he joins the Nightray dukedom. His entire family is abusive towards him aside from his blood brother Vincent and his younger adoptive brother Elliot. Duke Nightray (Gilbert's adoptive father) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">barely ever around</a> and lets his vicious and power-hungry oldest children run the household while Duchess Nightray (Gilbert's adoptive mother) goes from just barely ever being around like her husband to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">joining a cult and spending all her time with them.</span>
</li><li> Ada Vessalius, Oz's younger sister, counts as this as well. Her father actually loves her in the inside while he despises Oz, but he still hardly ever sees her and, of course, her mother is still dead. She didn't really have any of friends and spent most of her time cooped up in the Vessalius manor until she went away to Lutwidge Academy.

It's only later in the series that the <em>real</em> reasons for her loneliness are revealed — not only she was quite affected by her father's demise when she was a little girl, she just doesn't think people can understand her true feelings, and so is unwilling to open up to anyone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Of course, her issues remain unnoticed long enough to turn into a real problem, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> seizes her and turns her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a></span>.

</li><li> Christopher "Chris" Thorndyke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> - or at least, the show's writers try to play him like this, but it doesn't really hit home when he does actually have some genuine human friends and his grandfather is almost always at home even if his parents (who definitely love him) aren't. His parents are both horribly neglectful and smothering in the first two seasons; rarely seeing their son for more than a few hours at a time before having to disappear for some reason, but at the same time demanding to know where Chris is at all times and conducting a world search if he's missing for more than any period of time. They do apparently get better at the end of the second season.
</li><li> The entire main cast of the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpecialA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpecialA">Special A</a></em> qualifies thanks to various relationship traumas during their childhood.
</li><li> Minto Aizawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, who initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">Jumped at the Call</a> but refused the built-in gang of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> out of snobbery. She gets better, though, especially when Zakuro shows up and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirl</a> side kicks in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura">Tona-Gura!</a></em>, Nina Isokawa is a sweet but annoying example, and as a result is very devoted to her friends, the Arisakas and Kaguras. Her extreme early-bloomer bustiness freaks Yuuji out, but at no time does he try and exploit her obvious crush on him. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> nature always freaks Marie out.
</li><li> Eddie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> is a rich kid, whose parents work a little too much and often leave him alone on his birthday, along with the presents they give him and celebrates his birthday with his friends alone.

Granted, the guy doesn't act or appear friendly, but then again, who would when he had to endure the type of pain Gozaburo inflicted on him as a child? He doesn't have any friends, but he spends more time with his Yugi, his band of misfits, and his kid brother than anyone else.

But over the past half-century, Richie has acquired so many devoted friends that he doesn't really qualify anymore.
</li><li> Tim Drake, the third Robin, had exactly this kind of 'rich kid abandoned' childhood, at least up until the part where his father died and Bruce Wayne finally adopted him. But even before that, it took 125 issues of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">his solo title</a> before his father finally noticed that his son was leading a double life, and even then he practically had to be handed the revelation on a silver platter by the plot. And that was after their relationship <em>improved</em>. Initially, Tim's parents paid him so little attention that he focused on <em>Batman</em> (who he had seen exactly once, to boot) as a parental substitute.

On the one hand, he is genuinely lonely, being a black kid from the notoriously-white Brentwood neighborhood in LA who'd have no social life if it wasn't for his MMORPG subscription and his family's yearly get-togethers with their friends. On the other hand, as the series goes on, it becomes increasingly clear why he's so lonely - he's a sociopath who has no compunctions about manipulating his childhood friends into attacking and possibly killing their own parents or each other, all so that his own family will survive a planned apocalypse.
</li><li> Harry Osborn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> often was shown to have this background before he met Peter Parker.

The memory-wiped Anna, who doesn't realize what's going on, spends most of their childhood alone and desperately trying to reconnect with her sister. It is implied that she doesn't spend as much time with her parents either since they have to devote extra time to trying to help Elsa control her powers.

So as the story opens, Chance is middle-aged but otherwise, he fits the trope: he's attended to by a maid; he spends his days eating, sleeping, tending to a garden, and watching television; and he has no friends. Perhaps luckily, he doesn't <em>know</em> he's not living a normal life.

Once Harry ends up among his own kind (wizards) and away from the Dursleys, he's a bit confused by how popular he is and does find very good friends fairly soon.

</li><li> Draco Malfoy - despite being a racist bully, it can't be denied that he gets most of that smugness battered out of him in the later books. Parental abandonment in the form of imprisonment, and he never seems to have any close friends that he considers his equal.

</li><li> Theresa is implied to be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans">Class of the Titans</a></em>; her father is a wealthy workaholic who buys her things and gives her plenty of spending money but doesn't really spend any time with her, and it's hinted that her mother is dead. She isn't indicated to have any friends outside of the team of heroes, either.
</li><li> Eric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> is hinted to have been like this in the past. Might explain quite a bit of his behavior, if you look at it closely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>:
<ul><li> Remy Buxaplenty counts. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">his workaholic and billionaire parents' EXTREME neglection of him</a> is Remy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> as well as the reason why he's got a fairy godfather in the first place. It almost makes Timmy Turner's home life seem normal in comparison.
</li><li> This was shown of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Trixie Tang</a> in an early episode. When Timmy becomes a girl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBenderFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBenderFriendship">he befriends her</a> and finds she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek">Closet Geek</a> who feels she can't be honest with the popular kids. She even admits that a real friend was her preferred birthday present.
</li></ul></li><li> Pacifica Northwest from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, but this seems to be in great part due to her parents (who are way worse in that regard than she is, and that's an accomplishment) actively encouraging her to look down on anyone who is less well-off than she is, as well as pressuring her to be perfect at all times. Judging by how much Pacifica fears them, they might well be outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> as well, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is proven true when we learn that they've used Pavlovian conditioning to make her obey at the sound of a bell, like a dog</span>. While she is popular for her wealth, she does not seem to have any real friends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Dipper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Mabel</a></span>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Sarah Whitney from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Horseland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Horseland">Horseland</a></em>. When she first arrived, everyone assumed she'd be another mean snob like Chloe and Zoey, but they find out she's really friendly and not mean at all.
</li><li> Whitney Stane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em> fits both main types perfectly. She has a terrible relationship with her busy CEO father (commenting she has to now make appointments just to see him) and being an outcast at the school she goes to. The other kids act like she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> for doing things like eating lunch alone on the roof, but that's only because none of them are willing to befriend her due to who her father is. Her only real friend is Tony Stark, who would often brush her off until he found out just how bad her home life was.
</li><li> Pizzazz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> is this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">gone horribly, HORRIBLY wrong</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mother</a> + a Father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">too busy in his work</a> = an attention-starved little girl who grows into a spoiled, sociopathic, screaming, manipulative, and raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">superbitch</a>.
</li><li> Alexis on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> is an unapologetically spoiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> celebrity who seems to hate other kids as much as they hate her. Still, she confesses to Superman that she just wants to have friends and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">be normal</a>, not the richest girl in the galaxy. It turns out she <em>really</em> never learned to take 'no' for an answer, though: When Superman makes it clear he can't just drop everything and spend time with her whenever she wants, she figures the solution is donning a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">kill all of Superman's friends in the Legion to eliminate the competition</a>. And then, in the end, she realizes that she <em>doesn't</em> want to be normal after all and that being a supervillain is her true calling. Er, yay for a happy ending? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's shown on her prison uniform the name Luthor, which explains everything.</span>
</li><li> Quite common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>, with the kids in question receiving varying degrees of sympathy.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Adrien Agreste</a> (who is pictured above) was homeschooled for most of his life, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father</a>, even after letting him go to school, is an obsessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> who micromanages his life. Consequently, before he went to public school, he did not have any friends other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Chloé</a>. This causes a bad first impression to everyone in the class, since they all hate Chloé. When he finally manages to explain his friendless background to Nino and Marinette, both are moved and befriend him (well, Marinette falls for him). While he makes more friends as the series goes on, his primary social circle is still fairly small.
</li><li> Justified with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Chloé Bourgeois</a>, since she's a self-absorbed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> who treats everyone poorly - even her supposed best friend Sabrina (so far, the only known exception is Adrien, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">even he has his limits</a>). She's seemingly unaware of this, though, as she firmly believes everyone loves her... until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Malediktator" reveals that Chloé is aware that everyone hates her, and that's one of the reasons she wants to leave Paris with her mother</span>.
</li><li> Downplayed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">Lila Rossi</a>, whose mother is busy at the embassy, but she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">well-liked at school</a> due to her elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityLie">Celebrity Lies</a>, managing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">mask her true nature</a> from everyone but Marinette and Adrien.
</li><li> "Ikari Gozen" reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Kagami Tsurugi</a> also falls into this trope, as she has no friends outside of Adrien, and her mother is also very controlling (case in point; she considers <em><strong>Gabriel Agreste</strong></em> overly lenient towards his son). Finding out about this motivates Marinette, who'd previously been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">hostile</a> towards Kagami, to reach out to her.
</li></ul></li><li> Julie Kane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity">Motorcity</a></em> is probably this, which may or may not be the reason she joined the Burners. Only three people know she's Kane's daughter (which presumably includes Claire and Tooley).
</li></ul><ul><li> Hinted at a few times with Gem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SabrinaTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SabrinaTheAnimatedSeries">Sabrina: The Animated Series</a></em>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> she realises that nobody cared enough to be with her on Christmas Day; when Sabrina trades lives with her, she realises her father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">Married to the Job</a> and the mother is never off the phone. Also when Gem loses her money in "Stone Broke," she wonders if she was ever truly happy when she was rich and of course her "friends" flat out abandon her when they find out she has no money. Of course, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Gem</a>, she somehow makes it work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Burns is shown in flashbacks to have been offered the choice between warm, loving parents or a heartless billionaire. He chose the billionaire, making him a Lonely Rich Kid by <em>choice</em>. Though the only thing he regretted is leaving his teddy Bobo behind.
</li><li> In the episode "Burns' Heir," Bart went through the temporary version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> gives a variant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token</a>, who went through one episode feeling lonely because he lacked any rich friends to whom he could relate. He eventually realized that the other South Park kids still liked him anyway.
</li><li> Dakota from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a> Revenge of the Island</em>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> attitude is really a cry to be loved.
</li><li> In season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHollow">The Hollow</a></em> it's revealed that Kai falls into this trope.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Ayn Rand and Albert Speer were hallmarks of lonely top intelligent and rich children.
</li><li> Every single child of royalty and nobility up to the 1950s, as per the usual childrearing practices of the time. After birth, the baby is immediately fobbed off to an army of nannies, wet nurses, tutors, etc. and you only really met your parents on special occasions. There was a possible exception in the case of King George VI's children, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. King George VI (known familiarly as "Bertie") and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, tried to raise their daughters as normally as possible, and it reportedly crushed the former Prince Albert when his daughters curtsied upon greeting him when he was crowned king. (His elder daughter Elizabeth is of course now known as Queen Elizabeth II.)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> was determined to avoid this trope. She and Prince Philip were very hands-on parents (to the point of changing nappies and bathing their children) and insisted that the children be sent to primary school to get a traditional education rather than being taught privately at home by tutors.
</li></ul></li><li> Puyi, the last Emperor of China, reigned from childhood and according to tradition was sequestered away in the Forbidden City with nobody but concubines, court officials and eunuchs for company. One of his tutors in a memoir wrote of him: "I think the Emperor is the loneliest boy on Earth."

His father was a widower and much older than his mother. He was his parents only child and his only half sibling, his brother James, was twenty-eight years older than him. Due to his father being older, he was also a lot younger than most of his cousins. Therefore he grew up mostly around adults and didnt have any real friends until he started college at Harvard.
