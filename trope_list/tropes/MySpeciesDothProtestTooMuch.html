</p><ul><li> There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a> who wants to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrisy</a>, or just an excuse to show why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">defected</a> to a rival group.
</li><li> So that the human characters can show their inherent moral superiority by demonstrating that they really care more about honor than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstruction</a>: Real people don't come from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a>, and when you've got an entire species who has only one character trait among them, there are only so many interesting stories you can tell before you've got to make the characters more complex.
</li><li> Plain old logic: Think about which individuals among them would choose to go live and work with humans.
</li></ul><p>Often happens to races who seem at first to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, resulting in them proving themselves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysEvil">Not Always Evil</a> thanks to the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">Token Heroic Orc</a>. May lead to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> as those who reject the hat fight the ones who love it. Despite the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect">Klingon Scientists Get No Respect</a>, they may not believe this trope and choose to "rebel" in order to enable their peers to wear their hat.

Note that in Shakespeare's time, "protest" meant "proclaim solemnly or firmly" (which, in context "the lady" was suspiciously overdoing). That's the opposite of its modern western connotation, "dissent loudly", although it still occurs in "Protestant Christianty" and "to protest one's innocence".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yn86');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0yn86" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yn86');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">However, in this case, it works with either definition</span> Using the example from above, Bob's warrior species "protests too much" by overly avowing violence, when all Bob wants to do is flirt with Alice the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Granola Girl</a>.

When Goku learned that he is a Saiyan, he initially denounced his race and wanted nothing to do with them. After the events of Namek, he does embrace his Saiyan heritage, although he makes a point to say that he's a Saiyan raised on Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has a perfect example with Zamasu. an apprentice Supreme Kai and one of the main villains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(technically the <em>only</em> villain, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">multiple versions of himself</a>)</span> of the Future Trunks Saga.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallHeroes">Dragon Ball Heroes</a></em>, this is how Froze, a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Frieza</a>'s race, felt. In the debut trailer for Froze, an alien child throws a rock at him, clearly thinking that he's a bad guy like Frieza. He gets over it after Froze saves his life.

</li><li> Also Meowth. Even his teammates Ekans and Koffing tell him PokÃ©mon are never bad, only their trainers are. However, Meowth either never had or no longer has a trainer and still has no difficulty committing criminal acts. He also hates the idea of being captured by a trainer (with a few exceptions of humans <em>he</em> would have chosen to serve).
</li><li> One episode features a Rhydon, despite being a rock-type, enjoys swimming in lakes, rivers, and ponds. All the while doing so without being harmed by the waters. It still shown to be weak against water during a battle though. A reference to how it can learn "Surf" in the games.

Which makes "Goodboy"'s murder of their <em>entire species</em> another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> moment. To be fair, he didn't know that all female Psychlos were sterilized before being sent offworld or that the bomb he sent to their planet would do more than take out the capitol city.
</li><li> Naturally, this shows up sometimes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse">Star Trek Novel Verse</a>. For example, two of the alien characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> novella series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarfleetCorpsOfEngineers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarfleetCorpsOfEngineers">Starfleet Corps of Engineers</a></em> fit the trope. The first is P8 Blue the Nasat, who likes to "shake things up" and have adventures, in contrast to the rest of the Nasats, who are typically super-cautious, conservative, and hate taking risks. There's also Soloman the Bynar (formally known as 110), who received his name after his mate died, and he refused to return home and take a new partner as expected. But the trope is averted with the third alien character, Tev, who is very much the stereotypical Tellarite. This is noted by a human character, who in fact thinks Tev is the <em>most</em> stereotypical Tellarite he's ever encountered. Meanwhile, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekExMachina">Star Trek: Ex Machina</a></em>, there's Spring Rain on Still Water the Megarite. Most Megarite females spend their lives sitting on beaches, doing little else, and consider travel to be "beneath" a female. Spring Rain On Still Water, though, prefers a more adventurous life, and believes her people's lack of interest in exploration or contact with offworlders is a dangerous trait in a culture. She has in turn been condemned by her matriarchs for "lowering" herself.
</li><li> Dobby and Firenze in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series. Interestingly, in Dobby's case, you don't find out he follows this trope until two books later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, when you encounter some house-elves still wearing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">Happiness in Slavery</a> hats. Leads to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, because, for most house-elves, "freeing" them (or even offering to pay them) is cruelty, because it essentially means firing them from the job they love. Dumbledore deals with this by keeping house-elves at Hogwarts, but treating them well and freeing and/or paying them if they should happen to want it. Dobby is also shown downplay this trope when he reveals that Dumbledore offered him the standard human wage and weekends off, but Dobby instead requested 10% of the salary and one day off a month, saying that he didn't want <em>too much</em> freedom or at least compensation. Firenze is nearly killed by his herd for dismissing their ideology and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">betraying them</a>" by accepting a paying position as a teacher from a wizard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em> and is only saved by Hagrid's timely intervention.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore">R.A. Salvatore</a>'s Chaotic Good drow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt">Drizzt Do'Urden</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies">so much</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedCopycatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedCopycatCharacter">copied</a> and parodied. Which also demonstrated the dangers of this trope â€” derailing or blurring the original concept:
<div class="indent"> <strong>R.A. Salvatore</strong>: This will sound strange, I know, but I'm almost a bit saddened by the success of Drizzt. He was the "different" drow, but because of his popularity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies">others are emulating him more and more</a>. Why does that make me sad? I fear for the integrity of the evil drow race as antagonist.
</div><ul><li> Drizzt's case later was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">partially</a> self-deconstructed (<em>Dark Mirror</em>).
</li><li> Also applicable to the surface-dwelling followers of <a class="urllink" href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Eilistraee">Eilistraee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the only non-evil Drow deity. They convert "spider kissers", but it's not a "rebellion": Eilistraee chose to stick to her <em>old</em> ways (and keep followers there) despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceÂ–Heel Turn</a> of Araushnee-Lloth. Also, lots of ambiguousness ensued. They were pictured half as dangerous as other drow: paranoid, prone to gregarious overreactions and requiring constant supervision of alert semi-divine being to keep them on the right way â€” and then some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">questioned</a> <em>her</em> dedication to Eilistraee (<em>Silverfall</em>).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen">War of the Spider Queen</a></em> series, a few of the characters (notably the wizard) are set up to be possibly not-evil, but then spectacularly banish this notion by murdering friends and the like. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pharaun Mizzrym</span> betrayed out of fear and felt bad about it, so he doesn't quite fall out of implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryld Argith</span> stays as nice guy as he can afford to be, to the end. Even so, neither character did jump out of the Drow ways.
</li><li> How to one-up Salvatore on this trope, in the same setting? How about <a class="urllink" href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Shield_of_Innocence">orog paladin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>! Oh, and after he died, Queen Zaranda created the Loyal Order of Innocents (dedicated to Torm) and petitioned them to consider Shield of Innocence for a nomination as their patron saint.
<ul><li> One of the 3rd Edition rule books contained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">succubus</a> paladin. Which is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>: if everyone <em>knows</em> that you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, they can use that knowledge to resist your seductions, while if there's a possibility that your sob story of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a> is actually true...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One can find this reflecting different cultures of humans (Alderaanians compared to Corellians) as often as different species in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>.
<ul><li> For example, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, Winter Celchu (a childhood friend of Leia's from famously-disarmed Alderaan) quickly came to favor military action against the Empire (and there had to be <em>some</em> Corellian actuaries.) Not to mention that in the EU, Alderaan only disarmed in the prior twenty years or so, making taking up arms once more fairly easy (one story even has it that all their war materials were put on ships that could be called home assuming this was necessary). For a more conventional example, after the Battle of Endor, Twi'leks were tired of being seen as a species of scheming male traders and their female merchandise, and the strong warrior tradition of the species came to greater prominence as the warriors became more vocal. Finally, it's noted that species that tend more strongly to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a> (like the Ithorians) stay that way by kicking out troublemakers, so that members of the species encountered out in the galaxy are far more likely to be examples than those on the homeworld.
</li><li> Note that in Star Wars (EU at least) "Hats" tend to be treated more as cultural stereotypes, usually mildly to extremely offensive to the given race, depending on the nature of the race (but not necessarily the accuracy of the stereotype) - i.e. Corellians, by and large, enjoy their reputation, while Voort SaBingring, the Gamorrean on Wraith Squadron, certainly does not enjoy his (though he is forced to admit that the reason he escapes his species' hat is due to being biochemically altered). Nat Secura is similarly shown to be distasteful of the attitude taken towards Twi'leks, as is Nolaa Tarkonaa (though she fits the scheming stereotype to a T).
</li><li> Blotus the Hutt subverted the "Ruthless Gangster" stereotype of the Hutts, by having served 275 years as the Chancellor of the Republic, and is considered one of the most well-liked chancellors in its history. Then again, this was 9000 years before the movies. Hell, there was even a Hutt Jedi once, though he fell to the Dark Side, so that's kind of iffy.
</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> series, this was half of the point of the Edge of Victory duology - a chance to see a Yuuzhan Vong that <em>wasn't</em> a lunatic warrior. The books introduced Vua Rapuung (an embittered and vengeful but honorable ex-warrior who'd been burned by a love affair gone sour), Nen Yim (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> with enough redeeming traits she probably would have been an outright heroine had she not been raised in a culture that had no problem with using sentient beings as lab rats) and fleshed out the Shamed Ones, the Vong's oppressed slave caste who didn't give a damn about their superiors' genocidal ambitions. Before that we had Nom Anor, who was every bit as evil as his colleagues, but evil of a <em>completely</em> different flavor- he was a self-serving, cowardly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> in contrast to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">violent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">fanaticism</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a> invokes this more than once when it comes to Twi'leks. When Rogue Squadron visits Ryloth on a diplomatic mission, they meet with representatives of both the merchant and warrior castes. The latter laments the fact that Twi'leks are viewed as traders at best and slaves or criminals at worst, and accuses the former of playing into galactic stereotypes. Later, when a Twi'lek member of Rogue Squadron meets a fellow Twi'lek fighter pilot who <em>had</em> been a slave, she rebuffs his attempts at polite conversation, saying they had nothing in common.
</li><li> A key aspect of Chiss culture is their aversion to preemptive strikes. Grand Admiral Thrawn, arguably the most well-known Chiss, is a strong, outspoken advocate of this military strategy. Suffice it to say, he is exiled by his people.
<ul><li> Later books, particularly Survivor's Quest, Thrawn's former disapproving superior Formbi seems to have come around to this perspective, as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Introduced during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em> novels, Darth Vectivus is one of the very few if not the only Sith in the entirety of Star Wars history who was not a completely insane conquering despot. A effective if ruthless businessman, he simply goes to the Sith, learns what they have to teach, works his way up to Sith Lord, and then goes right back to his old life without a hitch.
</li><li> This is a bit of a running theme/gag in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic comic</a> by John Jackson Miller, as a few secundary alien character are as opposed to their species' "hat" as can be :
<ul><li> The Moomo brothers are Ithorians, but also stupid and brutish, with one of them obsessed by explosives whereas the other has a fondness for bludgeons of all stripes.
</li><li> Slyssk is a Trandoshan who gets nauseous at the thought of the hunt and would rather cook whatever the hunters bring back.
</li><li> The Zeltron, a race famous for its empathetic abilities, gives us the sociopath <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Antos Wyrick</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> To date, about three vermin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> have pulled the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelÂ–Face Turn</a>. The first, Veil in <em>The Outcast of Redwall</em>, smacked into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a>. The third, Romsca in <em>Pearls of Lutra</em>, also had to die for her chance at redemption (although to be fair, the scene <em>was</em> moving). Blaggut in <em>The Bellmaker</em> is the only named vermin character who had never seemed evil to begin with, probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">he wasn't bright enough to be a true threat</a>.
<ul><li> There were also all the surviving rats on the island in <em>Marlfox</em>. At least, they seemed pretty happy and content to live without weapons and evil rulers.
<ul><li> Same thing seems to happen in <em>Eulalia</em>. Which also contains a hedgehog who starts out a spoiled kleptomaniac (though he does reform) and a downright rotten vole (voles could go either way in the Redwall books-a previous vole character was entirely indifferent to others, spying on his fellow slaves for the villains).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly averted in the fantasy novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsByNecessity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsByNecessity">Villains by Necessity</a></em>. The near-extinct Nathauan race is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">known for their cruelty, rampant destruction, and penchant for eating any sentient race</a> (including their own). Valeriana, one of the protagonists, is from said race...she can't be as bad as all that, right? <em>Wrong.</em> When she arrives and her power is questioned, she looses a fireball as a demonstration, with total disregard for anyone or anything in the way. She then treats the party as if she's an Evil Overlord and they her subjects, and after her weakness is exposed she only agrees to rein in her more extreme impulses because the fate of the world is <em>slightly</em> more important...and only because saving the world means there will still <em>be</em> a world to terrorize six months later. That said, it's shown that her kind were capable of love.
</li><li> Mo Willems' picture book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed</a></em>.
</li><li> The Judoon Commander in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> novel <em>Judgement of the Judoon</em>. Over the course of the book he remains obsessed with justice and rather heavy-handed about delivering it, but he becomes less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper">Old-Fashioned Copper</a>, and more aware of how his definition of "justice" affects other people. He even develops a sense of humour.
</li><li> This has happened to several draconians in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting, most notably Kang and his regiment.
<ul><li> Gnimsh the gnome is one as well. He's the only gnome whose inventions actually work, and because of that, he's reviled by other gnomes since he "sets back creative development by decades".
<ul><li> There are a few gnomes whose inventions work. They're known as thinker gnomes(as opposed to the regular <em>tinker</em> gnomes), and they're sane.(Regular gnomes are supposed to be cursed by Reorx.) Similar are afflicted kender, the ones who survived <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Malystrx destroying Kendermore</span> and now know fear. They are serious and not childish. One can play as either in the D&amp;D setting, even though AT BEST there's a couple thousand of either.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBFG">The BFG</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>.

The BFG is the only good member of the race and is horrified at his cohorts' brutality and anthropophagy, which the other giants disown him for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndAnotherThing">And Another Thing...</a></em> features a Vogon who has feelings and doesn't want to kill anyone.
<ul><li> In this case, the book implies this is because the particular character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEvolution">more highly evolved</a> than the rest of his race.

<ul><li> Teckla are supposed to be cowardly peasants, but in the novel <em>Teckla</em>, Vlad meets one who is a rather insufferable revolutionary. <em>Athyra</em>, which has a Teckla as the viewpoint character, suggests that Teckla only seem cowardly out of necessity, because they're at such a disadvantage to other Houses.
</li><li> Dragons are known for being militaristic and ultra-ambitious, but Vlad's partner Kragar is totally unambitious. He's also so completely ignorable that it became impossible for him to actually command troops, forcing him out of the house altogether.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> has a number of these. Ax, coming from a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">proud, xenophobic warriors</a> ends up adopting humanity as a sort of second race and questioning many of the things he was taught by his own people.

<ul><li> As many of those Yeerks are quick to point out, if you get all of your initial information on what Yeerks are like from <em>Andalites</em>, then it may just be that some of that information is not entirely accurate.
<ul><li> The Hork-Bajir run on this trope. Initially they are given hints to a more gentle nature, but we only later find out that they those claws are for harvesting bark from trees, not killing animals, they are actually quite timid because their local ecosystem makes Australia look like a petting zoo and they had to be taught how to fight for their own freedom, though they were surprisingly fast learners and in that respect, and are so staunchly pro-freedom that they could put a freedom thumping American to shame (they will gladly slice open their own skull and show you their Yeerk free brain if challenged on being a free Hork-Bajir).
</li></ul></li><li> Andalites turn out to be a bit of a subversion. It's the military that are the jerks. When they meet other civilian Andalites, they find they are much more decent people than the war Princes.
</li><li> The Yeerks have an empire. Their leader is an Emperor. He's a democratically elected member of the council of 13 whose sole ruling power is to cast a vote when the other 12 members reach a deadlock. He doesn't vote unless and until such an event happens. And he's not allowed to tell the general public he is the Emperor, in part as a check on his power. Can't abuse your authority when it can be stripped if you let others know you have it, right.

Rather than gracefully singing to plants, she works in a forge. Where most elves are polite, reserved, and evasive, she's somewhat crude, loud, and honest.

They are also known for being generally ignorant - perhaps alone among European rulers, King Philip IV of Spain makes little attempt to replicate up-time technologies. His brother Fernando, on the other hand, who was essentially the Spanish viceroy in the Low Countries, decides to crown himself King of the Spanish Lowlands, creating the Dutch Hapsburgs as a third branch of the family. He also arranges an unofficial peace with the USE. While he remains nominally a vassal of his elder brother, the Spanish Lowlands are effectively neutral, and he is working to the point that he will be able to openly oppose the Spanish Hapsburgs (and the Austrians, although they will probably be busy dealing with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">imminent Ottoman invasion</span>).

</li><li> The League of Temperance is an organization of vampires who have sworn off "the B vord", and embraced a life of cheery sing-songs and delicious cocoa, oh my vord yes. The Temperance League is modeled after drug rehabilitation groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. We are informed that most people find "reformed" vampires to be very weird, and we see plenty of evidence that this is so. Apparently the craving cannot be eliminated, only channeled, and usually it is with laser-like intensity.

Most of them are the mindless Uul. A few have grown to a level of maturity and intelligence to become members of the ruling class called the Hij. The Hij constantly seek out new prey for their hordes of Uul. The Hij care little for the Uul, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserve</a> tactics to defeat the prey. In the third novel, the crew of the USS <em>Walker</em> meets a Grik-like creature whom some humans have named Lawrence. Lawrence has striped coloring, unusual for a Grik, and is actually quite calm. He reveals that his people, the Tagranesi, who are of the same species as the Grik but are a different race. Unlike the Grik, the Tagranesi care for their young and teach them to be civilized and cooperative. They peacefully interact with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">New British Empire</span> and have even learned to understand and speak (to an extent) English. They still hunt but only for food and to kill dangerous predators. They also defend themselves against other tribes.

He repeatedly tells his (human) daughter that if she were a dragon he'd have to constantly watch her for betrayal, but because she's human he can love her unconditionally.

Sure, if it makes me posthumously famous and gets my kids all kinds of breaks in life.)
<ul><li> Interestingly, Gaheris Rhade, a Nietzschean in the series, was quite depressed at what a race of self-absorbed bastards his species turned out to be.

Kosh is the noticeable exception, as he constantly watches over people whom he believes to be important for the younger races to liberate themselves from the old ones, going so far as opposing his own government and sacrificing his life.</span> Lyta comments after having Ulkesh in her head that she felt that unlike him, Kosh actually cared for the younger races.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Ulkesh was a better example of your typical (if such a word can be applied to them) Vorlon.

However, Adama (the military leader of the Colonials) and Cavil (arguably the Cylon leader) are both atheists. Similarly, the Sagittaron "hat" is a more fundamentalist form of Colonial religion (which also involves a rejection of modern medicine), but Dee, the most prominent Sagittaron character on the show, doesn't wear the hat.

The possibility that Goa'uld with the evil-inducing genetic memory could be converted to the side of good is an exciting prospect for the heroes...then it turns out the Goa'uld tricked Shau'nac to infiltrate the Tok'ra. This finally settles it for good: the only good Goa'uld are Tok'ra; the others cannot become good.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>
<ul><li> The prime example would be the Klingons. They talk a lot â€” an awful lot â€” about how they are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a>, but virtually any actual Klingon you might meet is almost certainly little better than a street thug. The most famous Klingon, Worf, knows this better than anyone, and it really disappoints him, having idealized his species while growing up in the Federation â€” and particularly because, although he could show his emotions more freely, he is otherwise already there: the ideal, moral, honorable, passionate Klingon warrior.
<ul><li> This trope is the central premise of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "A Matter Of Honor", where Riker serves aboard a Klingon ship in an officer exchange program. They don't outright contradict their stereotype, but they're shown in a much more complete and complex light than they had been in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em>TNG</em> episode "Suspicions", there's a Klingon scientist who has the double stigma within her society because of her profession and her gender, Klingon society being male-dominated.
</li><li> Also used with one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>'s</em> recurring background characters, a Klingon <em>restaurateur</em> of all things who is overweight and loves to serenade his customers with Klingonese folk songs while playing an accordion-like instrument. Not threatening at all. Most of the Klingons we saw before were from at least minor nobilityâ€”this is one of the only Klingon commoners we've met.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> episode, we meet a Klingon lawyer who laments that the warrior caste had pretty much taken over and bullied the rest of their civilization into being the one-note <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> stereotype they're associated with.
</li></ul></li><li> Another good example would be the Ferengi from <em>DS9</em>. As time went on, several of the more ridiculous aspects of their civilization (particularly their treatment of women) were discarded by various characters (particularly Rom and Nog, the latter of whom eschewed a life of business for one in Starfleet).
<ul><li> This is most evident in the episode "Profit and Lace" where two Ferengi discuss the emancipation of women, pointing out the extremely obvious fact (even more ridiculous when you consider the Ferengi's "hat" is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohnsDealership">rampant capitalism</a></em>) that allowing women to make money allows them to <em>spend</em> money, and opens up all manner of new industries and opportunities for profit (creates more competition, though). It also shows that the Ferengi â€” or any other culture â€” will change in their own time and their own way, not by having change forced on them from outside.
</li><li> The <em>TNG</em> episode "Suspicions" had a Ferengi scientist who notes that it's "almost a contradiction in terms" (presumably in that he's part of a scientific community that shares findings with no worry about "profit" â€” Ferengi tech <em>does</em> seem to be up to par with Federation tech throughout <em>TNG</em>)
</li><li> Quark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zig-zags</a> on this trope. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> who regularly claims to uphold (and often does) the Ferengi values of avarice and misogyny, yet he frequently runs into pangs of conscience that tell him to do otherwise (like not screwing over his friends for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">latinum</a>, or paying Pel to travel). Although Odo and the Federation frown on what he tries to get away with all the time, he also runs afoul of his Ferengi regulator by getting guilted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">charitable, "hu-man"-itarian" and philanthropic activities</a>, or taking "only" a 30% kickback on his employees' tips.
</li><li> In the episode "The Magnificent Ferengi", we meet a Ferengi who finds more pleasure in fighting and hunting than in latinum. Quark and the others find him very strange for this, but they do acknowledge that he's a great warrior.
</li></ul></li><li> The Changelings in <em>DS9</em> are fanatically obsessed with order. Having had bad experiences with fearful species, they turned to enslavement, brainwashing, and domination. Odo was abandoned to infiltrate other species and learn their culture before instinctively returning to the homeworld. However, integrating into Bajoran society <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">went horribly well</a>, and instead of wanting to dominate others, he devoted his entire life to justice. When he finally does return to his homeworld, he is shocked to find the rest of his species to be oppressive dictators, and instead stays with his friends to help them defend against being conquered.
</li><li> A strange example occurs in <em>Enterprise</em>. The Vulcans are characterized not only by logic and the silencing of emotion, but also by duplicity and paranoia, not unlike Romulans of earlier series. The Syrrannites are a rogue sect who strive towards the ideals of Surak, a legendary Vulcan pathfinder (in that, if Vulcans bothered with religion, he would be their Moses). The Vulcans in that series claimed to follow the teachings of Surak, but had "fallen," so to speak â€” they forgot what Surak had really stood for. T'Pol says that reading Surak's works were a life-changing experience for her.
<ul><li> Same Vulcan problem, different series: the "Take Me Out to the Holosuite" episode from <em>DS9</em>, in which Capt. Solok's anti-Sisko crusade, supposedly in the name of logic, bears an odd resemblance to the behavior of a schoolyard bully. As many fans have noted, Solok's resemblance to the <em>Enterprise</em>-era Vulcans is far greater than to the more recent (timeline-speaking) incarnations.
</li><li> The issue with the Vulcans is primarily explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> and the various novels which assumed that Spock was a typical Vulcan, and that his statements of what Vulcans were like is unvarnished truth. In reality, aside from Spock, the Vulcans that were seen in the <em>TOS</em> episode "Amok Time" demonstrated that Vulcans could be entirely duplicitous and exhibit jealousy and resentment as well as casually planning to have someone killed just to get what they wanted. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Valeris</span> was proven capable of deceit and murder, and assorted Vulcans in later shows also demonstrated Vulcans were far from perfect. Spock is, in effect, equivalent to Worf in being a bit of an outsider who lives up to the ideals of what his people <em>should</em> be rather than what they actually are.
</li></ul></li><li> Another strange example are the El-Aurians, Guinan's people. Their hat is supposed to be that they're great listeners, but Guinan is the <em>only</em> example of this we've seen; the other two El-Aurians we've seen in major roles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> Mazur from the <em>DS9</em> episode "Rivals", whose ability to listen is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> (it gets mentioned, but he doesn't come across as especially perceptive) and Soran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>, who is far too busy being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>. Soran boasts of the El-Aurians' listening skills while practicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> on Geordi, so he himself may be unclear on the concept.
</li><li> The Cardassians are initially presented as the Planet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>, but as time goes on, it's eventually revealed that they do have a history of democracy and political diversity to rival humans â€” they're just stuck in an ongoing cycle of poverty, dictatorship, military overspending... And all of the Cardassians we meet for the first few seasons are from the military, which is coincidentally the only reliable way to get fed. Imagine judging humans if the only country you landed in was North Korea. They end <em>DS9</em> on another major disaster and it's left unclear whether the cycle will continue.
<ul><li> Several episodes of <em>DS9</em> involve Cardassians who are members of the Dissident Movement, an underground faction that's trying to move their culture away from a military dictatorship and towards democracy and social reform.
</li><li> The <em>TNG</em> episode "Lower Decks" has a Cardassian officer who's turned informant for the Federation. He explains to another character that his choice wasn't because he supports the Federation over Cardassia, but because he knows that another war with the Federation would not be in Cardassia's best interests. He also understands that while the Federation would never start such a war, there are many within his own government who <em>would</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Romulans are portrayed as conniving and secretive (the most notorious among them is the Tal Shiar, the Romulan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>), but there are exceptions.
<ul><li> In the <em>TNG</em> "Unification" two-parter, there's a Romulan underground movement who opposes the Romulan government and supports a peaceful reunification between Romulans and Vulcans. The dissidents are friends and allies of Ambassador Spock.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>, the Qowat Milat is an order of warrior nuns who practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">the Way of Absolute Candor</a>, meaning that they always speak the truth â€” <em>all</em> of the truth, whether or not others want to hear it. Elnor, a young man raised by the sisterhood, seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">utterly incapable of lying</a> and has trouble recognizing deception in others.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Angel, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>. All vampires are evil except for him, because his hat completely fell off when he got his soul back.
<ul><li> Potentially even more so the case with Spike, who although joined the good fight much later, also freely <em>chose</em> it while soullessâ€”unlike Angel, whose soul was forced upon him. While the series and comics will later introduce more soulless vampires with redeeming traits and who don't <em>mind</em> doing good if it's convenient for them, Spike seems to be the first and only to go as far as to retrieve his soul himself and firmly choose the side of good completely of his own volition.
</li><li> Lorne, aka The Host, born in a demon dimension where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">humans are cattle</a>, everyone is a deathly serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>, and there is no music (<em>only dancing!</em>). Lorne, on the other hand, hates fighting, loves humans, and has the power to read people's souls when they sing karaoke.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> includes a rather bizarre example. In the Series 6 episode Rimmerworld, Arnold crash lands on an alien planet and begins cloning himself in order to gain companions. Skip a few hundred years, and the planet's inhabitants wind up revering any and all Rimmer-like behavior, including cowardice, selfishness, and honest to goodness double-dealing two-facedness, with those who deviate from the norm being hunted down. Ironically, it's the original Rimmer who becomes an outcast because he's too un-Rimmer-like.
<ul><li> "Outcast" is putting it lightly. They tried to <em>kill</em> him, but he was saved by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> drive so they locked him up instead. After all, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, it is shown that <em>most</em> Kryptonians are cold and logical, and believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>. They tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">look down on the human race</a>. It was even implied that Clark Kent had been sent to Earth to conquer it. Naturally, Clark decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and protect the world, embracing his love and compassion. Clark later meets Dax-Ur, Raya, a clone of his mother Lara, and Kara, who think similarly (the first three died, and Kara went to the future).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> with the demon Ruby. There are a lot of suggestions (particularly in the third series) that she has retained her humanity, particularly the capacity for empathy. Throughout the third and fourth series, the other characters bring this into question a lot.
<ul><li> There's also the question of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">Angel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicWoobie">Castiel</a>, particularly his unquestioning obedience and how disconnected he really is from human suffering.
<ul><li> Eventually Cas goes rogue from Heaven and begins to slowly Fall into a human, firmly joining the Winchester group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> despite remaining a weirdo. Then he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">dies</a>. Then he gets better, with new and improved powers. <em>Then</em> he goes slowly over the deep end while trying to lead the pro-human side of the Second War In Heaven, and eventually betrays everyone in the quest for enough power to end all this suffering, and declares <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a></em>...if we throw in the mid-Season Four brainwashing to sew his hat back on, this guy has spent three seasons (half the series) playing Three-Handed-Hat-Juggling.
</li></ul></li><li> Ruby turns out to be a subversion, however, when it's revealed that she's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, and the whole thing was an act to gain the Winchesters' (particularly Sam's) trust.
</li><li> Meg is probably the least demony of all demons. Though still clearly evil and enjoys the pain of others, she is willing to work with the Winchesters for her own benefit even though killing them would effectively take the target off her back. Most demons torture or kill without question, which is why most of them wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a>.
</li><li> Crowley seems better fit for human life as he is more civilized and always up for a good negotiation. This makes him similar to Todd from Stargate: Atlantis or Ba'al from Stargate SG-1. They're all bad but they at least give you time for a nice conversation before trying to kill you.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, Scarrans are generally aggressive, tyrannical, and utterly ruthless... except for Naj Gil, the Peacekeeper test-subject encountered in "Fractures."

<ul><li> While we don't see many Nebari during the show's run, what we do see suggests that Chiana was very atypical. The other Nebari are militaristic and devoted to the state, while she is a criminal and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon">trelk</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One episode reveals that she and her brother Neri were secretly infected with a disease and allowed to flee Nebari space, since they would sleep around and infect many members of enemy races.</span>

He eventually explains that all dragons except the Dragon Lord used to be good until the rest of his kind were corrupted by the Dragon Lord.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a> has the reverse: Satan was of a different race from the angels (the jinn, whence we get "genie") made of living, smokeless fire, who like humans have free will. Satan refused to bow to Adam when God created him, cursing that God created a creature of "dirt" (Satan, being a fire creature, viewed himself as more "pure") and led most of the Jinn against God. However, many of the Jinn returned to God over time, what with prophets and their messages trickling down to wherever they reside (frequently not Hell.)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3rs5o');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3rs5o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3rs5o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And very frequently inside your living-room wall. This is part of the reason the Qur'an's basic message about jinn is more or less "Yes, they exist, yes, they can be anywhere, now would you <em>please</em> stop worrying about it?"</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> gives us Chiron, the only good Centaur. Almost all of the other Centaurs were vicious, self-serving brutes, but Chiron was a wise healer and teacher of Heracles, Theseus, and Jason. His accidental death at the hands of Heracles resulted in his transformation into a constellation (either Sagittarius or Centaurus). Chiron was not actually related to the other centaurs, although he looked like them. They were the children of Ixion, a mortal king, and a cloud that he mistook for the Goddess Hera, and were a punishment for his lust. Chiron was the son of the Titan Cronus. There was one other civilized Centaurâ€”Pholus, who depending on what myth you read was either an unusual but ordinary Centaur or (like Chiron) not actually one. Pholus died in the same incident when he pricked himself with the arrow that killed Chiron while preparing Chiron's body for burial.

</li><li> New Phyrexia has a straighter example in Urabrask the Hidden, the Praetor of red mana. As a result of belonging to the colour of individuality, freedom and emotion, he's marginally nicer than the other Praetors (he favours 'non-interference' over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated">You Will Be Assimilated</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">Final Solution</a> on the matter of the Mirran survivors).
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat trivially used in the first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta">Talislanta</a></em>, where the Tanasian faction in Cymril wear the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Hat</a> of being Wizard-Guys In Green And Yellow. Their city is made of green and yellow glass, they dress in green and yellow, they're humans who have <em>yellow-green skin</em>. In contrast, the Pharesian sect are Cymrillians who got sick of the color green, left their homeland in disgust, and dress in multicolored garments while painting their bodies with every color <em>but</em> green. Later editions played it more realistically: the monochromatic color-scheme is just a demonstration of Cymril's excessive conformity, which is what the Pharesians <em>really</em> hate.

<ul><li> The Tau have Commander Farsight.

</li><li> Orks have a variation: while their basic strategy is to run towards the enemy firing guns and screaming Waaagh! (they're tough enough and numerous enough for this to work), the Blood Axes clan has been known to use highly suspicious tactics such as retreats and camouflage. Such distinctly un-orky behavior would be grounds for immediate execution, except that the Blood Axes tend to produce very successful warbosses.
</li><li> Ork Kommandoes have a similar situation, although in their case it's less foregoing their species' genetic goal (run towards the enemy etc.) and sneaking up to the enemy and planting bombs before revealing themselves and shooting/blowing the place up.
</li><li> The Ork gods, Gork and Mork, embody brutal cunning (hit you <em>really</em> hard when you're looking) and cunning brutality (hits you hard when you're <em>not</em> looking). The Blood Axes and the Ork Kommandoes are simply Orks who follow Mork's example over Gork's. The most successful warbosses are those who are brutally cunning <em>and</em> cunningly brutal.

<ul><li> In most party-based RPGs, the player character and his crew of supporting characters are adventurers, children, or otherwise unemployed, making the party's characters being exceptions to their various social norms somewhat justifiable. After all, it's not the typical, productive members of a civilization capable of settling down and learning the racial trade that are going to tend to hare off into the sunset looking for magical fairy treasure.
</li><li> A staple Trope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bioware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bioware">Bioware</a> games:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>, the Player Character itself is a child of the God of Murder, and although you are allowed to follow in Daddy's footsteps as a force of evil, the game mostly expects the player to want to be a hero and act in a nice way. The PC's half-sister, Imoen, is in the same circumstance as a Child of Bhaal and is distinctly on the bright and cheerful side of Good. All your other Brothers and Sisters, however, are Warlords and Mass-Murderers to a man/woman/elf/drow/fire giant/dragon/half-dragon/werechincilla....
<ul><li> On the other hand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">first game</a> shows that the murderous Children of Bhaal have actually been hunting the less power-hungry axe-wielding ones, and so the ones that the player gets to meet are the "cream of the crop". This is especially true for the Throne of Bhaal expansion, where most of the Bhaalspawn are met.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>, we do actually get to meet a relatively peaceful, non <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> Bhaalspawn- During the Shadows of Amn, a man in a bar yells, "A Bhaalspawn? Here?" And seemingly explodes/teleports. In the Throne of Bhaal, we learn that his Bhaalspawn ability is that he teleports whenever he gets really scared. Unfortunately, to "help him," the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> removes his ability to be afraid. Which would be great- Except the city he's in is under siege by a Bhaalspawn who wants to kill all his siblings. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quest</a> involves helping him out, although it's possible the teleportation scrambling magic killed him- According to the end game, you and Imoen were the only ones left alive, so they probably got him somehow.
</li></ul></li><li> In the same game, one of the potential NPC's who can join your party is Viconia, an member of the evil drow race forced to flee from her home in the Underdark and live in exile on the surface. Despite an otherwise perfect setup for a 'hatless' existence, she specifically states that she is still power-hungry and a murderer and spends most of her time trying to convince the PC to give in to their murderous nature in order to exploit their godly power. And yet, if you enter into a romance with her, at one point she reveals that the reason she was exiled in the first place is because she was verging on being a paragon of morality among her kin - that is, while she was perfectly happy to murder and kill in the name of her evil religion she didn't want to sacrifice children on the grounds that they were worthless as sacrifices, and only represented unquestioned subservience to her spider-goddess rather than a valuable offering. If you continue the quest to its completion, you find out that she loved her brother (love supposedly an emotion alien to the vicious drow culture) and will eventually renounce her evil ways for the love of the PC, dropping her firmly in this Trope.
</li><li> A reoccurring joke in the Baldur's Gate series is references to, and eventually the appearance of, Drizzt Do'Urden - another drow who forsook his evil birthright to champion goodness and justice. He is the archetype within RPG systems as being the one exception to an overwhelming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> situation.
</li><li> In the 2nd game, an Ogre Mage named Madulf and his followers, a few Gnolls and other Ogres, are initially blamed for the attacks on the village in Umar Hills. You can kill them...or you can listen to his side of the story. Madulf explains that he and his men were just tired of fighting and arrived here hoping to live in peace. They are also in the same boat as the villagers since his men are also being killed by the same dark force. Madulf and his men just want to be left alone and allowed to trade goods in the village in peace. Helping them to do just that nets you a hefty amount of experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> has another long list of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> who seem to be the only exception to their races' normal behaviour. Daelan Red Tiger is a Half-Orc Barbarian who is <em>not</em> a psychopathic thug (even though he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> and obsessed with honor), Grimnaw is a Dwarf who has neither a battleaxe nor a beard, Linu Lanaeril is a clumsy Elf, Haedraline is an Old One who does not support Queen Morag's resurrection, and the Player Character can be just about anything you want, from an Intellectual Half-Orc to an Elven Barbarian.
<ul><li> The Shadows of Undrentide expansion features Xanos and Dorna as your companions. Xanos is an intellectual Half-Orc Sorcerer, whereas Dorna is a Dwarven Thief, and she has little interest in Dwarven culture.
</li><li> The Hordes of the Underdark expansion keeps up the trend. Deekin the Kobold bard is apparently the only literate and adventurous member of his species; Nathyrra is another Good drow; and Aribeth is a Paladin who is not utterly prudish and takes several opportunities to flirt with the PC.
</li><li> Nathyrra is both the proof of, and the exception to the Trope. Although she is a Good member of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, she is also one of the followers of Eilistraee, a Good Goddess forbidden to be worshipped by most drow but still manages to garner a reasonably sized following, a good deal of whom are met in the game as NPC's. She <em>does</em> have an evil alignment, but this seems to be just a way to give her the Assassin specialisation.
</li><li> In the vanilla campaign, you can find an intellectual orc who serves as an advisor to a fire giant leader. He gets offended if you comment that he's "quite well-spoken for an elf".

Since most of the galactic community view humanity as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">greedy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfish</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">bullying</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Entitled Bastards</a>, most aliens s/he meets are downright <em>shocked</em> to meet a human who is <em>reasonable</em>, respectful, and helpful to aliens.

Averted for Renegade Shepard, who plays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a> galactic stereotype <em>dead straight</em>.
<ul><li> Urdnot Wrex of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, at first glance, appears to be another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">typical krogan</a>. However, it turns out that a long time ago, he tried to convince his people to give up their warlike tendencies and just focus on breeding and survival after their last disastrous war. He wasn't very successful, and now is just another bitter, angry krogan mercenary who signs up with Shepard for the money. Later on in the game, however, Wrex reveals that he's stayed on with Shepard for so long because he felt that by joining Shepard, he could finally fight for a cause more valuable than just credits.
</li><li> In <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if Wrex survived the events of the first game, by the time Shepard meets him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">he's managed to unite the krogans of Tuchanka under him</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">attempting to bring his people out of their self-destructive ways</a>.</span>
</li><li> Also in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legion is an odd case. His role in the story fits this trope. He's the one geth you meet who doesn't worship the Reapers, and doesn't want to kill all organics. But he's actually the first representative we've seen of the main-stream geth culture. The geth that Shepard has been fighting all along are a splinter faction Legion refers to as "heretics."</span>
</li><li> Yet again in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> could be the batarian you meet at beginning of Mordin's recruitment mission. While nearly all batarians we have met up to this point have been A) criminals, B) slavers or C) all of the above, this one is simply a normal guy afflicted with a plague, and is verbally thankful to Commander Shepard. It has actually been noted that due to the dictatorial batarian government, few people outside of batarian space actually meet an average batarian citizen.
<ul><li> <em>Mass Effect 3</em> confirms the same is true of most batarians. From the refugees we see from Khar'shan - the batarian homeworld that was destroyed by the Reapers - most are very pleasant, and they are revealed to be a deeply spiritual people with their own pillars of faith. Most are more than happy to talk to Shepard and receive aid from him/her.
</li></ul></li><li> Matriach Aethyta, who works as a bartender in Illium, is extremely disillusioned with how her people prefer to spend their golden years being sexual playthings or mercenaries instead of serving the Asari republic meaningfully, such as strengthening their military and expanding their scientific knowledge. She even mentions how she was mocked by other asari for the "absurd" idea of studying and building their own mass relays. So now, she tends bar.
<ul><li> She is even a double.... "Protester", since she is also half krogan. Although she does seem pretty violent sometimes, she is often shown as being not, too, as in the example above.
</li></ul></li><li> Garrus says he's "not a very good turian" because unlike most turians, he's more interested in working toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMccoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMccoy">what's right than following orders and staying within the strict confines of a hierarchy</a>.
</li><li> Liara is at the age when you're told that most asari are out in the galaxy whoring it up and/or shooting it up. Instead, she's initially happy to be a solitary archaeologist and researcher. It's unknown if this is related to who her "father" is revealed to be: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aethyta</span>. Asari are also commonly stereotyped as sexually promiscuous, and Liara's a virgin as of <em>Mass Effect 1</em>, though according to her just how prone to promiscuity asari are tends to be exaggerated by other species.
</li><li> A sidequest on Illium in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> can end in you sending a crime boss evidence that some of his people are stealing from him. You are later met by a meticulously polite krogan who wishes to pass on his employer's thanks, and a small compensation for your help.
</li><li> Elsewhere in the same game, you meet several krogan scientists and a krogan mechanic. While the scientists' opinion of their lots in life vary (one is enthusiastic, another simply laments that he's not able spend his time researching better ways to destroy things), the mechanic has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> that without skilled technicians like him, there <em>is</em> no krogan might. And of course, the entire krogan arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> is made of this, by allowing Shepard to learn what the krogan <em>used</em> to be like, and could be like again.
</li><li> On Illium you find an asari and her krogan boyfriend who are "taking a break" as she's unsure whether he just wants to be with her so he can have kids. The krogan, Char, is trying to woo her and show that he really loves her... by reciting his poetry. Despite being a little corny, it is a really sweet love poem. Both Shepard and the asari comment on how unusual this is.
<ul><li> You can later find them on Tuchanka, where you find out that a few of the other krogans aren't to happy about her being there... and Char genuinely doesn't seem to care, whereas most krogans would have responded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">headbutting</a> anyone who badmouthed their girlfriend.
</li><li> Unfortunately, they reappear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> - the asari is a shopkeeper on the Citadel who gets some background chatter about Char with a racist customer. She mentions that he is deployed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You can find Char's corpse and a farewell message to his 'Blue Rose of Illium' while entering the rachni nest with Aralakh Company, and deliver the message to his girlfriend.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The rachni queen is a member of a race famous for bringing the galaxy to its knees in a scuttling tide, who claims she wishes only to live in peace, far away from the rest of the galaxy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's telling the truth, and it turns out the hat in question was installed on their heads by either the Reapers or the Leviathans.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> continues the tradition with Peebee, an asari who's tired of her species' tendency to take a long-term view of everything and prefers to live in the moment as much as she possibly can. This is because her parents were an elcor (a species noted for its slow, methodical ways and risk aversion) and an asari matriarch who'd reached the point in her life that Peebee's father was the active one of the two.
</li><li> <em>Andromeda</em> also has Nakmor Drack, an old krogan like Wrex who wants his species to move on from its violent, self-destructive ways. Unlike Wrex, though, he's not interested in leadership, seeing himself as an example of what was wrong with the krogan. His granddaughter, Kesh, is the chief engineer on the Nexus, responsible for keeping things running, while her boyfriend is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> botanist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect">who actually is respected by other krogan</a>.
</li><li> Nakmor Kesh herself is the <em>only</em> krogan we've seen who manages to get over her racial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">Moral Myopia</a> enough to admit that the krogan <em>earned</em> the affliction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SterilityPlague">genophage</a> due to their unwillingness to temper their breeding and using their role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Rachni War</a> as an excuse to conquer more worlds to better suit their numbers. Note that she still supports curing the krogan of it, she just understands why they were infected in the first place and does want the krogan to get over the destructive behaviors that led to them being infected in the first place.
</li><li> Vetra Nyx is a turian who never went into the mandatory military service of her people, and it definitely shows. She has very loose qualms about breaking rules in order to help people, and is very open about being a former smuggler who says "screw protocol" whenever red tape shows up. While she does admit that her former choice in profession wasnÂ’t the best idea, she does reveal in a couple of dialogues that most turians are pretty tense thanks to their culture, and is happy working in the shadows rather than the front line.
</li><li> Unusual for this trope, this even applies to the human party members in <em>Andromeda</em>, Liam and Cora. Most humans in the setting are stereotyped by other races as being pushy and believing that they should be in charge, Liam is trying to coordinate with some Angara behind the scenes but only takes charge at what he does best (disaster response) and knows when to fold em in favor of keeping the peace between other cultures. Cora has completely adopted asari culture after performing a service with asari military, something almost unheard of in any race. She even muses that if it wasnÂ’t for the fact that sheÂ’s straight, she would think that she was born into the wrong race.
</li></ul></li><li> Done <em>spectacularly</em> with Fall-From-Grace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, a succubus - in D&amp;D terms a creature formed out of raw chaos and lust - who has dedicated herself to chastity (she even wears a "chastity bodice"â€”it's not that nasty, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">her clothing is enchanted to automatically clean itself</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">demons don't excrete</a>) and civility, and is the only priest who can be in your party.
<ul><li> And more recently, Eludecia the Succubus Paladin from Wizards' D&amp;D Fight Club, though her level advancement had her going back to being evil and becoming a Blackguard.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Nordom</a> from the same game, who's a rogue modron.

Gamma freed the other E-series robots and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed himself</a> to free the Flicky inside him, Omega joined Shadow and Rouge and still fights against Eggman (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">though calling him "good" is a bit of a stretch</a>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a> II</em>, green tentacle alien Admiral ZEX is the only member of the xenophobic VUX who doesn't find humans repulsively ugly. In fact, he finds them "attractive". However, it could also be that he finds them as repulsive as the rest of his race, and is just sexually aroused by ugly things...
<ul><li> The Spathi have the Black Spathi Squadron, a band of rogue Spathi who, unlike the normal cowardly Spathi, wander space "performing brave and hostile deeds". They're never actually encountered in the game and are mentioned only in rumors; their existence is denied by the Spathi authorities.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> Orlok The Eternal in <em>Universe At War: Earth Assault</em> as he abandons the Hierarchy and starts a rebellion against them. He even goes so far as to declare his species a disease because they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">Planet Looters</a> who rampage around the galaxy destroying planets and civilizations greater than they for essentially kicks.
</li><li> Darkspear and Revantusk trolls from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> are sociable, loyal to the orcs and <strike>hate</strike> gave up cannibalism due to devotion to the Horde in sharp contrast to the other trolls who are cannibalistic and xenophobic. The latter is somehow even able to get along with, or at least tolerate, their ancient enemies the high/blood elves.
<ul><li> Another example would be Eitrigg, an Orc who left the evil Horde as he saw that they have abandoned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> ways and have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> under demonic influence. He later on returns to the Horde after they have become good again under Thrall's leadership.
</li><li> The Darkspear/Revantusk-Blood Elf relations are a testament both to how atypical those tribes are and how far blood elves have come from being a race on the brink of extinction to where they are now.
</li><li> Several of the undead who joined the Argent Crusade seem to feel this way about the Forsaken, most notably Leonid Barthalomew.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a></em>, one of the Frieza Race NPCs in Tokitoki City talks of how Frieza and his father, King Cold, were both ruthless tyrants, but that not all members of their race were as wicked and evil as them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> clearly established that once you've been bitten by a vampire, there's no turning back, you're boned, and the guy who bit you will now be a horrible bloodsucking monster. See: Satsuki, Arcueid. Six months of story time later, we have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> where Sion was bitten <em>three years ago</em> and is still almost entirely normal. In at least one route she even actually turns into a vampire after biting Wallachia but after getting beaten up for a bit she decides it's not really that much worse than it was before and she can still resist drinking blood and viewing people as lunch. She then leaves and goes back to work. Wait, what?
<ul><li> Justified Trope: Satsuki is actually pretty normal, as long as she is not under Roa's direct influence. Furthermore, Wallachia isn't a true vampire, and didn't have a physical form. Thus, it allowed Sion, who is also a powerful mage, to take great lengths to prevent herself from turning fully. Furthermore, note that Shiki himself managed to resist possession by Roa for a long period, and Sion was not 'drained/revived', like Satsuki was. In Short, there's a TON of circumstances that explain Sion's issues. (Note also that Satsuki regains most of her normal personality when she's playable.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Llyud</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></em>, who apparently "exhibits a curiosity not commonly found among the Aegyl, for which he is regarded as something as a curiosity himself.", and sides with the Sky Pirates.
</li><li> One of the underlying realities of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> is that life in (and under) Gensokyo has turned a lot of its more volatile residents into examples, yielding, at its worst, a tense understanding between humans and <em>youkai</em>.
<ul><li> Possibly because a certain miko goes around beating offenders up until they stop offending.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the Demons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> are absolutely evil bastards. Except for Sparda, who turned against his own kind to save the Human race, married a Human woman, who then gave birth to his twin children. One of whom, Dante, became the main protagonist of the series. His brother VergilÂ… kinda the opposite happened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">with him</a>. The animated series features a demon that Dante has been contracted to kill who has fallen in love with a human. When Dante encounters him in the alley, he asks Dante about his parent's relationship to validate the possibility of love in a demon.
</li><li> A minor example of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> with Vivi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">grandfather</a> Quan, who abandoned the swamps inhabited by the Qu race after becoming disenchanted with the traditional gourmand ways. Seeking new ways to taste food, Quan thought of attempting to fish the Mist from the sky and eat it, but eventually realized the importance of imagination and sharing one's experiences and memories after he catches Vivi instead. Teaching Vivi gives Quan a new perspective on life and eating, which he eventually shares with Quina and Quale. Quale, who used to be Quan's student and is now Quina's teacher, was himself fairly upset with Quan's deserting the traditional gourmand ways, but seems to come around after Quina starts grasping Quan's teachings.
<ul><li> This actually ties in rather beautifully with the driving themes of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">when you think about it</a>. Consider that the main theme of the game is, ostensibly, that "Life is precious not because of how long you live or how important you think you are, but because of how you choose to live it and what you do with the time you have". Quan's rejection of the shallow ways of most of his people - which basically consist of simply eating, and cooking for one's own self - enabled him to learn something deeper, giving him a unique individual strength and character which he shared with Vivi and later shared with Quina and Quale. Quina himself/herself is seen giving the same lesson to the Qu working in Alexandria's royal kitchens during the Epilogue.

Unlike some other groups, such as the Chimer/Dunmer, the Ayleids worshiped some of the more traditionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">malevolent Daedra</a>, leading their civilization down some very dark paths. Some of the Ayleids refused to worship the Daedra, instead worshiping the Aedra, and these two sides eventually went to war. The Daedra-worshiping Ayleids were victorious, and the Aedra-worshiping Ayleids were forced to flee Cyrodiil. (The most famous of these groups were the Barsaebic Ayleids, who settled in Black Marsh.) One of the dark paths the Daedra-worshiping Ayleids went down was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">enslavement</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">vile torture</a> of the Nedes, human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">ancestors</a> to most of the modern races of Men. Some of the Ayleids were disgusted by the treatment of the slaves by their brethren, and joined the slaves when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">revolted</a>. As a result, they were allowed to keep their lands as vassals of the newly-formed human Cyrodiilic Empire. (At least until, about a century later, the empire picked up an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">anti-elven</a> religion sect which killed or drove out the remaining Ayleids, leading to their extinction as a unique race.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer</a> provide a few examples in the backstory as well:

Their chieftain is said to have thrown the Volendrung Hammer across Tamriel and led his clan to "wherever the hammer fell", giving the region its name.
</li><li> In the final days of their known existence, it's said that many Dwemer didn't agree with the general idea to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">unmake themselves</a> and then reforge themselves into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">immortal godlike beings</a>.

The Thalmor essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">play up the worst stereotypes of the Altmer overall</a>. One is a Legate in the Imperial Legion who will readily tell you a story about dissident Altmer refugees being ambushed and slaughtered by Thalmor operatives. Another is a shopkeeper in Windhelm who offers to use her black market contacts to help smuggle the local priest and priestess of Talos out of the city should the Thalmor ever come by. Unsurprisingly, the Thalmor consider any Altmer who do not support them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">not be "true" Altmer</a>. One group that gets hit hard with this by the Thalmor are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Psijic Order</a>, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Magical Society</a> and the oldest monastic order in Tamriel. The Order and the Thalmor have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">extreme mutual hatred</a> for one another. The second disappearance of Artaeum (the island home of the Psijics) in the 4th Era is believed to be directly related to the rise of Thalmor influence. The Thalmor come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">The Resenter</a>, as the Order is an Aldmeri organization with immense magical knowledge but one that absolutely will not tow the Thalmor line or share that knowledge.
</li><li> Reversed in one case with Gissur, a Nord beggar who acts as a Thalmor stool pigeon, selling information to them in exchange for coin.

Gissur will usually meet his end at the hands of the Dragonborn during the main story, usually being killed in an attempted ambush along with his Thalmor masters.
</li><li> Also in <em>Skyrim</em>, the Nords are portrayed as being mistrustful of magic at best, then you meet a few Nord mages who go against the general Nordic rejection of magic.

An underling can challenge a leader for any grievance in the court of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>. A good leader can fight off the challenge to his authority and a bad one is a victim to it. In the first episode, Dinobot does this, but Megatron sidesteps by having a flunky take care of Dinobot, which means Megatron was not honorable in combat. Dinobot later challenges Optimus and, while he does lose, Optimus won't let Dinobot die because of circumstances unrelated to their combat, endearing him. It's telling that while Dinobot's Honor does force him back to Megatron's side when Megatron is proven correct, he never directly betrays Optimus Prime, even if the pair have several heated disagreements. It's not so much that Dinobot is this trope, but rather, the rest of the Predacons are this trope to Dinobot.

</div></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand">Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</a></em> dealt with one such example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen">Little Green Men</a>. He was derided by the rest of his species for being an "Independent Thinker". Going by the pilot episode, there's at least a cultural basis for this derision; when the Uni-Mind (which enables the LGMs' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>) gets stolen (and thus no longer unites the minds of the LGMs), the LGMs turn into utter morons; apparently, only a few individuals actually specifically know any given thing, and the others know it by being connected to the ones that do. On top of that, they're completely uncoordinated without the Uni-Mind's "my best friend is also my right arm" factor.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em> featured an alien robot who, instead of conquering planets, decided to whittle wooden reindeer.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "Dragon Quest", Spike has an identity crisis and joins the Great Dragon Migration to learn more about what it means to be a dragon. After a few rough spots, he starts to bond with a bunch of unruly teenage dragons and seriously considers staying with them to learn more about being a dragon. Spike changes his mind when they try to goad him into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">smashing a defenseless phoenix egg</span>. Spike decides that he's fine with being a pony at heart if being a "real" dragon means being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
<ul><li> Other episodes flip this however, and imply that the teenage dragons were this with respect to "real" dragons, as other dragons are consistently shown to simply be loners who simply don't care about other creatures either way and simply wish to be left alone with their hoards. The dragon from <em>Dragonshy</em> is aloof but not <em>intentionally</em> causing problems for the ponies, is civil until Rarity tries to steal his hoard, only turns violent when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Rainbow Dash kicks him in the face for no good reason</a>, and is ultimately willing to listen to reason. The dragon from <em>Owl's Well That Ends Well</em> is much more aggressive and prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, but only turns violent because Spike helped himself to his gems and otherwise seemed content to keep to himself. <em>Gauntlet of Fire</em> shows that most dragons are loners with the only one who's truly villainous being one of the ones from <em>Dragon Quest</em>. The two other dragons that become recurring characters end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. Finally, the villainous dragon from <em>Dragon Quest</em> is ultimately revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>.
</li><li> There was also the dragon that the group met during the second episode. His mad thrashings were creating severe turbulence in a river they had to cross. The ponies expect some insane beast, but it turns out he's just a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">fabulous</a> dragon that is having a breakdown because his mustache was ruined. An on-the-spot fix made him so happy he actually helped the ponies across the river (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Steven Magnet</a> is officially a sea serpent, which may or may not be a dragon subspecies. If he was, one would think Fluttershy would have been terrified).
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryWithinAStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryWithinAStory">Story Within a Story</a>, ancient Pegasi are presented as a culture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warhorse Breed Ponies</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E13HearthsWarmingEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E13HearthsWarmingEve">Hearth's Warming Eve pageant we see.</a> However, Private Pansy, their second-in-command, is played by Fluttershy and basically has her personality, neither proud nor warlike.
</li><li> Fluttershy can be seen as one of these as well, as her special talents (good with animals / nature) are usually the domain of Earth Ponies, and frequently seems to forget that as a Pegasus, she can <em>fly</em>.
</li><li> Though we don't really know the circumstances about it, an undisguised changeling is invited to the wedding in "Slice of Life". They must be exceptionally trustworthy though given their species reputation at such events. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56h9a');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note56h9a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56h9a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to M.A. Larson,</a> his name's Kevin and he's a friend of Matilda.</span>

Hanging around the other ponies starts to cause him to transform, which pays off in the season finale, "To Where and Back Again", where it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Changelings are actually starving with the way they live under Queen Chrysalis, who has been lying to them in order to "keep their hat on", so to speak. When Thorax comprehends what Changelings actually need as a society (to release love and not feed on it), it sparks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRaceTurn">HeelÂ–Race Turn</a> and ousts the Queen.</span>
</li><li> Gabby the griffon is this to the whole of Griffinstone because she is energetic, friendly and helpful instead of rude, greedy and apathetic.

In a more straight example, his actions do create a cell of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">resistance fighters</a> that also disagree with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">collaborating</a> with Cyclonia.

Indeed, Lion-O is treated like an outcast for that, and also believing in the myths of ancient technology (which turn out to be very real). He also is one of the few Cats who sees how misguided Thunderan society is, valuing pride and power over kindness and mercy towards enemies to prevent a cycle of hatred. The only Cats who really come close to Lion-O's view are Kit, Kat, and Panthro, who are shown to get along with Dogs, another rival race of the Cats, as well as Pumyra after Lion-O does some convincing. While it's not clear if Cheetarah shares this view as well, she does show a willingness to trust in Lion-O's judgment. Tygra, however, sticks to the old ways for the longest time, thanks to his upbringing. Grune may also count, since he can work together with the Lizard general Slithe.

In a twist, it's eventually revealed that the larger Gem Empire is deeply cruel and utilitarian.

The protagonists are actually the remnant of an army that rebelled to save the Earth from being colonized millennia ago, becoming a refuge for "defective" Gems in the process.
<ul><li> After this discovery, it seems that the Gems are divided into two factions: the protective Crystal Gems and the cruel Homeworld Gems. However, a trip to the Gem homeworld revealed the presence of the Off-Color gems, Gems who have either been rejected from their society for imperfections or who have <em>chosen</em> to become outcasts because they disagree with the Homeworld philosophy (mostly on the topic of fusion.)

Whereas the rest of his kind hide to avoid having to grant wishes, Dez walks about granting wishes willy-nilly.

Of course, the opposite may hold true instead, with the Citadel of Ricks being this to the rest of "Rick-kind" for preferring a structured life on The Citadel as opposed to anarchic existence, and Rick C-137 being an example of the norm for all Ricks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Take your pick.</a>
