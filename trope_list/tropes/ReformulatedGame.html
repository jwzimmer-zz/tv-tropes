</p><p>The further back you go in the history of gaming, the more you'll notice that bringing a game to another platform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">doesn't end well sometimes</a>. Occasionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishedPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishedPort">the port is better</a> or, at least, nothing that makes you miss the original. Some titles, however, cannot be considered simple ports - they're closer to completely new games. Important features are added (or missing); the mechanics have gone through substantial changes; most or all levels are changed; the visuals may have undergone a radical facelift; it may even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">belong to a different genre</a> now. Even the plot may be different! In the end, even if they are <em>supposed</em> to be the same game (and the publisher markets them as such), they share only the basic characters, story concepts, and maybe the fundamental elements. You may be a veteran of a game and still find a fresh challenge in the new version - the package is the same but the ingredients are not, or are mixed in a way that gives a new flavor.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This phenomenon can happen for a number of reasons, but the games it invests can be roughly divided into two categories.
</p><ul><li> <strong>Reformulated port:</strong> The game was supposed to be a port, and may have been so at the beginning of development, but became very different. Often hardware constraints made a straight port simply impossible; it's also not uncommon for a porting team to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">no access to the original code and assets</a>, so they have to develop from scratch. Other times, a port from a less powerful platform is seen as a chance to add features that couldn't just be implemented originally.
</li><li> <strong>Concurrently developed:</strong> The game was developed concurrently in several versions for many platforms. They are all marketed with the same title and, while one may be the "main" version, each is its own game and is tailored to its platform's capabilities and control interface. Some are stripped-down versions of another, while others may even belong to a different genre. This is somewhat common for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">Licensed Games</a>, though those which were made by different companies for different platforms (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>) should be technically disqualified even though they share a title.

</p><p>A less extreme version of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VersionExclusiveContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VersionExclusiveContent">Version-Exclusive Content</a>, where different platforms get different extra features but are still ultimately the same game.

<ul><li> Many arcade games, particularly during the 1980's and 1990's, were completely redesigned for their home versions. This was particularly prevalent with several NES "ports" of arcade games that wasn't a fixed screen platformer, since arcade hardware were already outperforming by 1985. Often times, the NES version was a completely different product from its arcade counterpart.
</li><li> Takara published <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> adaptations of popular Neo-Geo fighting games during the 90s such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldHeroes">World Heroes 2 Jet</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters '95</a></em>, as well as their very own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> hit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></em>. In Japan, these GB versions were released under the <em>Nettō</em> or <em>Dead Heat Fighters</em> branding, but the few that were released overseas were given the same titles as their original counterparts.
</li><li> Many of the titles featured in the Genesis version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52">Action 52</a></em> are completely different from their namesakes in the NES version. For example, <em>Cheetahmen</em> now involves climbing trees and rescuing cheetah cubs and other animals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfRockyAndBullwinkleAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfRockyAndBullwinkleAndFriends">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</a></em> lampshades this in the intro for the SNES version:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rocky</strong>: Say, Bullwinkle... doesn't our GameBoy (TM) game start this way too? <br/><strong>Bullwinkle</strong>: Darned if doesn't, Rocky. Just what are you guys tryin' to pull here? <br/><strong>Narrator</strong>: Uh... nothing. Nothing at all. This game is completely different. Just start playing and you'll see!
</div></li><li> <em>Amaurote</em> - The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> version differs from all the others in adopting a straightforward (and not very detailed) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView">Top-Down View</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsometricProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsometricProjection">Isometric Projection</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/softography/index.php?game=23">According to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the development team decided on this change at the start because their experience with converting their previous, somewhat simpler isometric game <em>Glider Rider</em> had shown them that "[t]he isometric system wasn't really suited to the C64 hardware."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> was completely different on the GameBoy from the NES game of the same name, despite featuring the same cover artwork. This point was brought home when an actual port of the original NES game was later released for the Game Boy under the title of <em>Battletoads in Ragnarok's World</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlezone1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlezone1998">Battlezone (1998)</a></em> was released for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> as <em>Rise of the Black Dogs</em>. Although widely believed to be a port, it actually had to be completely rebuilt due to platform constraints, which turned it from what could have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">miserable failure</a> into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishedPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishedPort">impressively accurate reformulation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a></em> on the arcades was a side-scrolling action platformer with a gameplay gimmick involving the use a wire to jump over obstacles instead of a jump button. The NES version, while retaining the wire-swinging gimmick, is a non-linear action game that alternates between classic side-scrolling action, <em>Commando</em>-style overhead segments, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel">neutral zones to take a breather</a> and find useful items and information, while having a complex plot with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">incredibly graphic villain death</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">wasn't censored</a>. It's considered among the best action games for the NES and, unsurprisingly, it is the version that was remade as <em>Bionic Commando: Rearmed</em> in 2008. In Japan, where the original <em>Bionic Commando</em> was titled <em>Top Secret</em>, the Famicom version was subtitled <em>Hitler no Fukkatsu</em> (Hitler's Revival) and was clearly marketed as a different game.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em>Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen</em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">arcade game</a> by Nichibutsu, was ported to the Famicom as <em>Booby Kids</em>, replacing the temporary secondary weapons with collectible <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BomberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BomberMan">Bomber Man</a></em>-like bombs, redid the levels to be less mazelike, and altered the treasure chests into items appropriate to each stage. <em>Cratermaze</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16">TurboGrafx-16</a> is a more faithful port, although its PC Engine counterpart was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">dolled-up</a> as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BumpNJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BumpNJump">Bump 'n' Jump</a></em>'s home versions were mostly straight ports of the arcade game, but Vic Tokai's NES version was completely retooled, with all-new plot, level design, and music.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDraculaX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDraculaX">Castlevania: Dracula X</a></em> (aka <em>Vampire's Kiss</em>) was an SNES adaptation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> Super CD-ROM<sup>2</sup> classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Dracula X: Chi no Rondo</a></em>. The fact that the porting team only had 16 Megabits to work with (the standard ROM size for most SNES games at the time) ensured that it was never going to be a straight port, even with the voice-acted cutscenes removed and music redone to save space. Instead, the developers took the basic plot and gameplay system from the original and developed an entirely new set of stages around them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em> is nowadays remembered as an NES game, but it was originally an arcade game. The two versions differ mainly due to the obvious hardware differences (such as the two player characters being palette swaps on the NES, whereas on the arcade Bill and Lance had different sets of sprites), with the arcade version notably running on a vertical setup (despite being side-scroller for the most of the game), but the level structure of the two versions also differ significantly. The arcade version consisted of three stages: the first two stages are divided into three segments each (a side/vertically-scrolling level set outdoors, a third-person segment inside a base and a boss battle set in a fixed screen), while the third and final stage was just one long side-scrolling level set across different environments as the player gets closer to the final boss. In the NES version, the side/vertically-scrolling segments of the first two stages were split into their own stages, as were the different areas of the final side-scrolling stages, resulting in an increased number of stages from three to eight. <em>Super C</em>, the sequel to the NES version, also differed significantly from its arcade counterpart (<em>Super Contra</em>). It more closely resembles the first NES game and uses the same letter-based power-up icons as the first NES game (rather than the gun icons arcade version went with), swaps the order of the last two stages, adds three new stages in-between and changed the final boss.
<ul><li> The MSX2 is notable too. Due to technical constraints of the system it resorts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipScreenScrolling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipScreenScrolling">Flip-Screen Scrolling</a>, and to accommodate that the level layouts are much different and shorter; this is compensated, however, by an entire set of new levels after the original final boss. Other changes include a life bar, the ability to keep and select several weapons, and the shotgun replaced by a "Rear Gun" that shots both forwards and backwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>D.J. Boy</em> - The Genesis version of the Kaneko arcade game featured different stages and bosses, lacked the 2-players co-op and changed the plot from retrieving a stolen boombox to rescuing the hero's kidnapped girlfriend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a></em> on the Sega Saturn was a relatively faithful conversion of the original Model 2 arcade game (with certain background details sacrificed), but the PlayStation version required an entirely new engine to be made, resulting in a vastly different game. To make up for this, Team Ninja added two new characters exclusive to the PS release, Ayane and Bass. This upgraded version was released for the arcades in a heavily modified form as <em>Dead or Alive ++</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DenjinMakai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DenjinMakai">Denjin Makai</a></em> was ported to the Super Famicom under the title <em>Ghost Chaser Densei</em>, where it kept only three of the arcade's six playable characters (Makai, Iyo and Belva), but added new story sequences that were not in the arcade game and added new moves to the remaining characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a> Maximum</em> used the same graphics engine, music, enemies, and weapons as <em>Descent II</em> for the PC and Macintosh in its PS1 release, but featured entirely new levels, which were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsShortSoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsShortSoItSucks">criticized for being smaller</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights">and darker</a>) than the PC version's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> was ported from the PC to the PS2 under the title of <em>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy</em>. The areas are broken into smaller maps to accommodate the PS2's limited RAM, the opening and ending sequences had been remade into pre-rendered videos and the user interface has been simplified.
<ul><li> This is <em>unfortunately</em> averted in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a></em> where the PC version is identical with that on the console. This means that in the sequel all the maps are quite small (so even the open areas sometimes consist of just one or two narrow corridors and several rooms) and loading screens are encountered frequently. The original game's PC version contains rooms (within buildings within maps) that are literally much larger and more spacious than any map in the console port or in the sequel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94">Donkey Kong '94</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">rather familiar</a> for the first four levels, but afterwards, the rest of the game shifts into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePlatformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlePlatformer">Puzzle Platformer</a> mode with keys, switches and movable ladders and platforms. The physics from the original arcade version are (mostly) intact though, although greatly expanded upon. Nintendo later made a spiritual successor to this game in the form of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a></em> for the Game Boy Advance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonI">Double Dragon</a></em> on the NES went as far as to actually rewrite the plot of the game. Whereas the arcade original had twin martial artists, Billy and Jimmy Lee, teaming up to rescue Marian from the Black Warriors gang, the NES version had Billy facing the gang alone, with Jimmy serving as the true antagonist. This change in plot was presumably done due to Technos Japan's (who also made the arcade game) inexperience with the NES hardware and their inability to program a 2-player co-op mode in time. The game's four stages (which in the arcade version consisted of one large outdoor map for the first three stages and a smaller indoor map for the final stage) were broken into 10 smaller maps, the on-screen enemy count was limited to two identical baddies at the same time (which admittedly eliminated the constant slowdown that the arcade version suffered from when it got too crowded), weapons could no longer be carried to different fights, all the moves (outside the basic punch and kick) were locked behind experience points, the two head-swapped bosses were gone and jumping was mapped to pressing AB simultaneously due to the NES controller's lack of a third action button.
<ul><li> The Game Boy version was itself a reworking of the NES version, making it a rework of a rework. Specifically this version changes the level designs completely and ditches the experience points system used in the NES version in favor of allowing the player character to use all of his moves from the start. It also lacks the sibling battle with Jimmy at the end of the game, although it does keep the one-on-one versus mode added to the NES version, which is playable via link cable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragonII">Double Dragon II</a>: The Revenge</em>, like the first NES game, was also very different from its arcade counterpart, although this time it kept the 2-players co-op feature from the arcade, adding the option to play the game with or without friendly fire. This version, in addition to featuring completely different levels (increasing the number of stages from four to nine), it also added comic book-like cutscenes between stages that told a somewhat different story from the one depicted in the arcade version. Whereas the arcade game has a simple revenge plot of Billy and Jimmy seeking to avenge Marian's death at the hands of Machine Gun Willy, the NES version added some supernatural elements and changed the game's antagonist to an unnamed rival warrior <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the game ultimately ending with Marian being restored to life when cleared on the hardest difficulty</span>. The 1993 PC Engine version released by Naxat Soft, while based primarily on the NES version, it does mix-in some elements from the arcade game too (such as the weapons used by enemies and the life bar and timer on the HUD) and redid the between-stages story sequences into animated visual scenes with full voice acting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em> became a side-scrolling action game on both, the NES and the SNES, as it was pretty obvious that neither console was capable of video playback (at least not with the ROM cartridges available at the time in the case of the SNES, as a homebrew port of <em>Road Blaster</em> would later be made for the system) like the Sega CD and other disc-based consoles that featured more conventional ports of the original Laserdisc-based arcade game. There was also a Game Boy version titled <em>Dragon's Lair: The Legend</em> that was actually a port of a ZX Spectrum game titled <em>Roller Coaster</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driver">DRIV3R</a></em> was adapted to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> by none other than French duo <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VelezAndDubail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VelezAndDubail">Velez And Dubail</a></em>, best known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming">pushing Nintendo portable hardware to their absolute limits</a>. While it uses a separate engine and code base from the original game, one would be surprised to know that the GBA version's maps are largely unabridged from the original console releases, save for simplifying or omitting certain details due to system or memory constraints.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdEddNEddyTheMisEdVentures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdEddNEddyTheMisEdVentures">Ed Edd N Eddy The Mis Ed Ventures</a></em> is drastically different than the console versions of the game (due to limitations on the GBA), although some plot points are remained. For starters, the first and second missions are swapped: in the console versions you do the watercooler-related mission first and then proceed to do the mission that involved Jimmy's party; in the GBA version, the party mission is now the first (and even then it was altered, as you are no longer going through a sewer), followed by the watercooler-related mission. A brand-new mission has also been added to the GBA version that was not present in the console versions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ESwat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ESwat">ESWAT</a></em>, much like <em>Shadow Dancer</em>, was also vastly different on the Genesis from its arcade counterpart. The stages are completely different and while the game seems mechanically identical at first, when the player eventually obtains the titular E-SWAT armor, the gameplay changes as well. Whereas the player's abilities didn't change that much in the arcade version after obtaining the armor (save for the addition of a machine gun as the new main weapon and a few sub-weapons), its counterpart in the Genesis version is equipped with an afterburner that allows the player to fly around for a limited time, as well as switchable main weapons in addition to the default shot. Much like <em>Shadow Dancer</em>, <em>E-SWAT</em> also received a Master System version that played more like a scaled-down port of the arcade game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersHistory">Fighter's History</a>: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu</em> ("Mizoguchi In The Nick of Time") for the Super Famicom started development as a port of the Neo-Geo based <em>Fighter's History Dynamite</em>, but ended up evolving into a stand-alone game. <em>Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu</em> lacks five of the fighters from the <em>Dynamite</em> roster (namely Ray, Jean, Marstorius, Matlok, and Samchay), but makes up for it by adding a new story mode with Chelnov (from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Chelnov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Chelnov">game of the same name</a>) as the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon">Ganbare Goemon</a>: Karakuri Dōchū</em> features completely different level layouts on the MSX2 from the Famicom original. Its biggest change was the addition of a new second player character. Whereas both versions have an alternating 2-Player Mode, the Famicom version simply has both players controlling Goemon, whereas the second player in the MSX version controls a new character named "Nezumi Kozō" (the Rat Brat). While Nezumi never appears in any other Goemon game, his character design was used as the basis for Goemon's sidekick Ebisumaru, who would later be introduced in <em>Ganbare Goemon 2</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Garou Densetsu: Dominated Mind</a></em> is a PS1 port of <em>Real Bout Fatal Fury Special</em> that removes the multi-lane system, adds new gameplay systems such as "Final Impacts" and "Quick Approaches" and introduces a new protagonist named Alfred (who makes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> in <em>Real Bout Fatal Fury 2</em> as a hidden end-boss), as well as a new end-boss named White.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a></em> has structured stage layout, side goals and hidden levels laid out as an adventure with a proper ending on the NES. Despite having the same basic engine, it's far different from other versions of the game, which is better known as an endless multiplayer coin-guzzler.
</li><li> <em>Golvellius</em> was originally a <em>Zelda</em>-style action RPG that switches between overhead and side-scrolling segments, and was developed by Compile on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX">MSX</a>. It suffered from extremely bland graphics and sound and falls victim to the system's notorious problems with scrolling. Sega remade the game on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Master System</a> with polished play mechanics, improved graphics, a completely new layout for dungeons and overworld, and some additions like new sub-bosses. Compile took note and made a sequel for the MSX2 titled <em>Shin Maō Golvellius</em> (nicknamed "Golvellius 2" among non-Japanese speaker), which played very similarly to the Master System version of the original.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature">Harvest Moon: Back to Nature</a></em> started out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation">Playstation</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em>. The devs ended up changing so much that it became its own game. The art-style is near identical to <em>64</em> and it shares almost all of the same characters, however everything else is different. Character's have different roles, different relationships, and different personalities. The town has a new name and there are different festivals as well. <em>Back to Nature</em> ended up becoming the de facto interpretation of the characters, with almosf every reappearance of them being based on the <em>Back to Nature</em> (or <em>Friends of Mineral Town</em>) versions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em> was ported to the 3DS as <em>Hyrule Warriors Legends</em>. <em>Legends</em> contained all the DLC from the original Wii U version from the start, additional characters and weapons, Story Mode levels themed around those new characters, and a "My Fairy" feature; as well as general gameplay balancing across the board. And then it got its own DLC packs, with even more characters and Adventure Mode maps. Some of this content was backported into the Wii U version (characters and weapons), but some wasn't (Story and Adventure Mode levels, My Fairy). The tradeoff is that the graphics had to be downgraded to run on the weaker hardware, and even then it's considered to be near-unplayable on older iterations of the 3DS due to poor framerate. It was then ported again to the Switch as the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, which combined the <em>Legends</em> extra content with the original game's better graphics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfTheMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfTheMonsters">King of the Monsters</a> 2</em> was more like a conventional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> than the original Neo Geo version.
</li><li> <em>Killing Time</em> has different graphics and level design on the PC. The plot is the same, but has two endings very different from the 3DO original's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klax">Klax</a></em> has two different Game Boy versions: a western one developed by Tengen, and a Japanese one by Hudson Soft. While the former is more faithful to the arcade game, the latter opts to render the playfield as a simple flat plane rather than in perspective.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightmareIITheMazeOfGalious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightmareIITheMazeOfGalious">Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious</a></em> was retitled <em>Dai-Ma-Shikyō Galious</em> and released for the Famicom a few months after the MSX original. It has a similar gameplay system as the MSX version, but the stage designs are substantially different, with a much smaller environment to explore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a></em>, despite being sub-licensed from Activision (the publisher of the <em>Labyrinth</em> computer game), was very different on the Famicom and MSX. It was not a menu-driven adventure game like the original, but rather a top down action game similar to <em>Zelda</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendaryWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendaryWings">Legendary Wings</a></em> made several changes from the arcade version on the NES, including adding a health gauge system where getting hit by an enemy simply reduces the player's shooting power by one level instead of dying in one hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings">Lemmings</a></em> is a straightforward port of the Amiga original in almost all of its incarnations. There are a few exceptions, though:
<ul><li> The NES and Game Boy versions by Ocean, due to the limited ROM space, featured only 25 stages per difficulty level instead of 30, most of which were completely new.
</li><li> The Genesis/Mega Drive version by Sunsoft maintained the original 30 stages per difficulty level, but had to deal with the console's lower video RAM. As a result, several stages, mostly early in the game, were cut down in size, while many others were replaced entirely (some of the new stages were lifted from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission-Pack Sequel</a> <em>Oh No! More Lemmings</em>). To make up for this the game features two new difficulty levels, making it considerably longer than any other version of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Line of Fire</em>, originally an arcade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame">Light Gun Game</a> with into-the-screen scrolling, was converted into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalScrollingShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalScrollingShooter">Vertical Scrolling Shooter</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> games for the SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, and NES were all more or less ports of each other of varying quality. The versions released for Game Gear and Master System, though, were essentially completely different games with similar gameplay. Besides the different level design, there is no roar meter, the notorious ostrich rides in The Mane Event are almost completely gone, The Stampede uses the same platforming engine as the rest of the game instead of its own, and Return to Pride Rock is reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel">Boss-Only Level</a>.
</li><li> The PS2 and Xbox releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaTheCityOfLostHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaTheCityOfLostHeaven">Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven</a></em> were drastically cut down due to memory limitations, though it can be partly blamed on how the levels were loaded as opposed to the engines used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>. A number of props and details was removed to save on memory, cutscenes were presented as pre-rendered videos taken from the original PC release, and the Freeride Extreme mode was cut altogether; in lieu of the latter it was replaced with an exclusive circuit racing mode which was previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> from the PC release. While the PS2 port fared worse with muddier, N64-esque textures, the Xbox version was a tad superior due to Microsoft's console having twice the RAM compared to the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PS2">PS 2</a>.
</li><li> <em>Makaijima</em> (aka <em>Makai Island</em>) was a remixed Famicom/MSX2 version of the Capcom arcade game <em>Pirate Ship Higemaru</em>. Originally <em>Makaijima</em> was planned as an original game developed alongside a separate Famicom port of <em>Higemaru</em>, but the two projects ended up being merged and <em>Makaijima</em> was transformed into a pseudo-sequel to <em>Higemaru</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em> began development on the NES almost immediately after the MSX2 version was released with a development period that lasted only three months. The porting team were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">ordered</a> to make the game as different enough from the original, presumably to lure double dippers, and the easiest way to do was by altering some of the level designs. However, some of the other changes, most notably the removal of the titular Metal Gear, were also the result of hardware constraints.
</li><li> <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a> is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">retitled English version</a> of a spinoff game known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel">Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</a></em>, which was modeled after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2">Metal Gear 2</a></em> but with a graphic style and other gameplay elements taken from the actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Mighty Final Fight</em> was an NES conversion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> that came out late during the system's lifespan (around the same time as <em>Final Fight 2</em>). While the NES version is 1-Player only and all the characters have been chibified, the play mechanics were translated almost accurately, with only a few moves missing, and all three characters were present. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo">No need to buy a second version with Guy</a> like on the SNES.
</li><li> <em>Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord</em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> port of the PC88 RPG <em>Haja no Fūin</em> ("Seal of the Dark Lord") by Kogado Studio (which was also released for other formats as the MSX2 and Famicom). The Master System version added a larger overworld and explorable towns.

<ul><li> <em>Monty on the Run</em> changes a whole bunch of things around on the Famicom Disk System from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> version. Most bizarrely, Monty is not a mole in this version, but an escaped human convict.
</li><li> <em>Impossamole</em>, originally released for Amiga, C64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum computers, was completely overhauled for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16">TurboGrafx-16</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonShop">Dungeon Shops</a> were replaced with in-level pickups, the weapon variety was reduced, Klondike Mine was replaced by the Alien Planet, which took the place of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BermudaTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BermudaTriangle">Bermuda Triangle</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDungeon">Final Dungeon</a>, Monty was given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameLives">multiple lives</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave">Password Save</a> system was added, in contrast to the original's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">one life and no continues</a>.

Lobotomy Software then decided to try their luck on consoles but, upon realizing a straight port was impossible, they developed the Slavedriver engine and ended up making practically another game. While PC <em>Powerslave</em> is forgettable and has overly long, boring levels, console <em>Powerslave</em> is one of the best early console <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">FPSes</a>, and loses some nicer textures in favor of faster action, full 3D movement and smaller, open-ended levels with new weapons and abilities to discover in order to advance, predating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> by over five years. Also, in a fun twist of irony, Slavedriver would later be used to port <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince Of Persia 1</a></em> had already several ports by the time it was released on the SNES, but all of them touched just the graphics and sound. This one features redesigned or completely new levels, new traps, new enemies and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battles</a>, and has a time limit raised to two hours.
</li><li> All three versions of <em>Psychic World</em> (the original MSX <em>Psycho World</em>, the Game Gear port, and the western-exclusive Master System port) have different level design, with the Master System version heavily compressing <em>Psycho World</em> and the Game Gear version compressing it even further.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> had console ports produced by two different developers. Hammerhead's PS port, other than the loss of the crouching function, hand grenades, and several levels, remained mostly faithful to the PC original, while the N64 port by Raster Productions underwent more drastic changes, having most of its levels completely rebuilt, and being noticeably shorter than the other versions due to cartridge space constraints.
</li><li> The N64 and Dreamcast versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> were at least decent adaptations of the PC version. The PlayStation version, by contrast, was almost completely reprogrammed, which turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">disastrous</a>. Gone was the tactical planning map and the multiple-team action. Instead, players were limited to using three operatives per mission, who could either be assigned to seperate insertion points or teamed up. AI and play controls were sub-par, and graphics were worse than most early PS1 titles.
</li><li> <em>Renegade</em> (aka <em>Nekketsu Kōha <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun">Kunio-kun</a></em>), to make up for the downgraded graphics and sounds compared to the arcade original, added new stages, hidden power-ups, a bike-riding segment and branching paths for the final two stages. The final stage in particular is now set in a labyrinth-like building where the player must go through a series of rooms populated by enemies from previous stages in order to locate the final boss. A wrong turn in this stage can lead the player to a previous area, including the very beginning of the first stage.
</li><li> <em>Rockman Battle &amp; Fighters</em> is a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManThePowerBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManThePowerBattle">Mega Man: The Power Battle</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2ThePowerFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2ThePowerFighters">Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeoPocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeoPocket">Neo Geo Pocket</a> Color. Since the system couldn't obviously replicate the specs of the arcade boards, the visuals are completely redone in a simpler and smaller style, almost akin to the 8-bit days of the series, while not sacrificing the gameplay. Notably, they were the only way to play those games on a console until the release of proper ports of the arcades in 2004.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RushNAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RushNAttack">Rush'n Attack</a></em> (or <em>Green Beret</em>) features a different plot on the NES from the arcade version, along with new stages and different bosses, but most notably a 2-player co-op mode (the arcade version only allowed alternating play). The game's arcade-only sequel, <em>M.I.A.</em>, followed suit by adding 2-player co-op as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rygar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rygar">Rygar</a></em> is a straightforward side-scrolling action game on arcades. The NES version starts with a linear stage that may seem a straight port at first but then opens to reveal a free-roaming world.
</li><li> <em>Section Z</em> was originally a flying 2D shooter released for the arcades in 1985 consisting of five stages (three side-scrolling levels and two vertically-scrolling ones, although all played from a side-view). The so-called "sections" in the game were simply short corridors that the player proceeded throughout the entire game until reaching the titular Section Z, where the final boss awaits. The NES version, released almost two years later in 1987, turned the sections into fully-fledged areas with branching paths and hidden rooms. There are three stages consisting of 20 sections each, but since the Sections are now numbered (starting from Section 00) instead of being alphabetized like in the arcade game, the final area is now Section 59 instead of Section Z, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">rendering the game's title meaningless</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush">San Francisco Rush</a></em> was reprogrammed on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> due to the system's lack of an FPU. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">No need to guess how it turned out</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Second Samurai</em> was released on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> in 1993 and is rather similar to the first episode, both in the visual style (including a main character who looks a bit goofy) and in the large levels full of collectables. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> version, released in 1994, is a brand new game with a completely different visual style, new music, and less open levels with a more arcadey gameplay. The two versions have basically just three bosses and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel">Unexpected Shmup Level</a> in common.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi">Shinobi</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> gives the player a health gauge (instead of making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>), adds more melee and ranged weapons, and changed the input method for Musashi's ninjutsu techniques (due to the lack of a third button). It also made the bonus rounds more frequent (occurring between stages, rather than after boss battles) and changed their purpose from gaining extra lives to accumulating ninjutsu techniques.
<ul><li> <em>Shadow Dancer</em> on the Genesis was also vastly different from the arcade game. Whereas the play mechanics remained almost identical to the arcade version, the stages were completely different and only two of the four bosses (a fire-breathing armored warrior and a sawblade-wielding female assassin) were kept from the arcade. There was also a Master System version released around the same time in Europe that was much closer to the arcade version, but featured only 8 of the arcade version's 15 stages (counting the boss battles, so in reality there are only four stages) and reduced the role of the player's canine companion to a special attack only.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBlastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBlastMan">Sonic Blast Man</a></em> was originally an arcade game released in 1990 consisting of five selectable mini-games in which the player must hit a punching pad as hard as possible in three turns. The game would measure the player's strength based on how hard the punching pad was hit and after the third turn, it determines whether the player has failed or succeeded. This wouldn't have translated well to home consoles, so the Super NES version released in 1992 was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em>-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage">bonus stages</a> adapted from the arcade version that required the player to rapidly rotate the D-Pad to build up strength before punching the target.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> was originally going to be ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> as well, but the people at Sonic Team soon realized they couldn't feasibly do it, even with a graphics downgrade. Instead, the group in charge of the port repurposed what they had and created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em> out of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a></em>
<ul><li> The original <em>Splinter Cell</em> was developed for the Xbox and PC by Ubisoft Montreal and then ported to the PS2 and GameCube by Ubisoft Shanghai. The PS2 and GC versions differed from the Xbox and PC originals with smaller level designs and the use of pre-rendered videos in the place of real-time cutscenes, due to their lack of RAM in these consoles. To compensate for these changes, the PS2 and GC version each offered their own exclusive content: while the PS2 version has an extra mission set in a nuclear plant, the GC version offers support for GBA connectivity in order to use an exclusive in-game item. The two sequels, <em>Pandora Tomorrow</em> and <em>Chaos Theory</em>, would feature similar differences among the same platforms.
</li><li> The fourth entry in the series, <em>Double Agent</em>, was a special case. The game was released across seven platforms, being made during a console generation transition. The version released for the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and is generally known as Version 1, while the version for the original Xbox, PS2, Wii and GameCube was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and is known as Version 2. The two versions follow the same general plot outline, but differ significantly in the missions they feature, their play mechanics and how the story ultimately plays out. Version 1 is considered to be the canonical version since that's where <em>Conviction</em> continues the story from.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrader">Star Trader</a></em> was a PC-88 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot 'em Up</a> with many cutscenes, adventure portions and a non-linear plot - unfortunately the shooting part, which was supposed to be still its core, was done badly. A later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SharpX68000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SharpX68000">Sharp X68000</a> version has much better graphics and mechanics but is just a straight shooter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> was a side-scrolling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> that was later ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>. Despite the fact that the Master System and Game Gear are virtually identical in terms of hardware specs, the two 8-bit versions of the game were substantially different from each other rather being ports of the same game. Particularly, the SMS version featured all three playable characters (the GG version was missing Adam), whereas the GG version had a 2-players mode via link cable (the SMS version was 1-Player). The SMS and GG versions of the sequel (<em>Streets of Rage 2</em>) were also different from each other.
</li><li> <em>Strider II</em>, the U.S. Gold-produced sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider">Strider</a></em> (not to be confused with Capcom's own arcade sequel <em>Strider 2</em>), was originally released in 1990 for various home computer platforms in Europe (specifically the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum). <em>Strider II</em> was later remade for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> in 1992 with redesigned stages and gameplay mechanics much closer to the original <em>Strider</em> arcade game. The Genesis and Game Gear versions were released in America under the title of <em>Strider Returns: Journey from Darkness</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunsetRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunsetRiders">Sunset Riders</a></em> was as accurate a port of the arcade game as possible on the SNES (save for the lack of 4-Player co-op and added modesty to some of the female NPCs). However, the Genesis version had a smaller ROM size than the SNES version and only contained two of the main characters (Billy and Cormano) and half of the bosses. Rather than making a straight port, the stages were completely redesigned, the bonus stages were changed and a new versus mode was added.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperDodgeBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperDodgeBall">Super Dodge Ball</a></em> (aka <em>Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball Bu</em>) is vastly different on the NES from the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Game</a>. In the arcade version, the player's team consisted of one adult character as the captain and three children. Only the adult characters have power shots and the health gauges shows the number of team members remaining rather than the health of each character. In the NES version, everyone is now the same size, but each player (not just captains, but all the members of a team) now have two power shots, individual stats and health gauges. The NES version also adds two new foreign teams not in the arcade version: India and Russia.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> version, subtitled <em>PC Bangai Hen</em> (PC Extra Edition), plays like a combination between both versions. The graphics, character roster and stages were based on the arcade version, but it adds elements from the NES version such as individual power shots and health gauge for each player.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em> was ported from the Wii U to the 3DS. It lost the Mystery Mushroom costumes, amiibo compatibility (meaning the player cannot access the Big Mushroom, which the developers made no compensation for its availability), and the ability to upload/download levels through the internet; but gained a new tutorial, a Super Mario Challenge mode, and levels could now be exchanged through local wireless or StreetPass.
</li><li> <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy">Meat Boy</a> Forever</em> is a reformulated version of the original <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, specifically designed for mobile devices in order to avoid turning the original game into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a>. It is not exclusive to phones/touch screens, however, as it is also available on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTurtlesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTurtlesInTime">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</a></em> received two console ports in 1992.
<ul><li> The SNES version is a straight conversion of the arcade game, lacking the 4-player co-op mode but adding one new stage (the Technodrome) and a few additional bosses: namely the Rat King, Slash (who replaces Cement Man as the boss of the prehistoric level), pirate versions of Bebop and Rocksteady, and Super Shredder (who replaces the regular Shredder as the final boss).
</li><li> The Genesis version (<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist</em>) on the other hand played more like a remixed version of the same game. The plot is different and while some of the stages and bosses were lifted from the SNES version, others were completely new. The new bosses included the human version of Professor Stockman (last seen in the first arcade game and its NES conversion) and Tatsu (Shredder's bodyguard from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">first two live-action films</a>). <em>Hyperstone Heist</em> is notably the only <em>Turtles</em> game to feature Rocksteady (based on his incarnation from the first arcade game rather than the pirate-dressed version in the SNES version) without his partner Bebop.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> been a straight port of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> game by the same developer with the addition of a CD-quality soundtrack and grainy cinematic sequences like other Genesis-to-Sega CD. Instead, it is a completely different game with better graphics and improved play mechanics. The manual even specifies that it's more than "just an upgrade."
</li><li> <em>Titan Warriors</em> was an unreleased NES game by Capcom initially intended to be an updated port of <em>Vulgus</em> (the company's very first game) titled <em>Neo Vulgus</em>. The game ultimately ended up being unreleased in any form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi">Togainu no Chi</a>: True Blood</em> - Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">visual novels</a> released for computers intended for adults are often altered for console versions. Often this just involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleachedUnderpants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleachedUnderpants">removing/rewriting sex scenes</a>. In the case of <em>True Blood</em>, the console ports added new characters, scenes and entire routes to compensate for the censorship.
</li><li> <em>Twin Eagle</em> for the NES was produced by a different developer from the ones who made the original arcade game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Area88">U.N. Squadron</a></em> was a side-scrolling flying shooter based on the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> in arcades. The player could choose between one of three characters, each piloting a different jet: Shin flew the F-20, Mickey the F-14, and Greg the A-10. The later SNES version differentiated characters by how quickly they leveled up the main weapon and how quickly they recovered from damage; each of the three pilots started with the F-8E Crusader and could purchase tother jets by using the bounty collected from completing missions. Additionally, while the SNES version lacked the 2-Player co-op mode from the arcade, it also added multiple paths between stages and new bonus rounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis">Valis</a>: The Fantastic Soldier</em> on the Famicom was a redesign of the PC88 original with branching stages that were easy to get lost in. The game was redesigned again for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> Super CD-ROM2in 1992, with a revamped gameplay system much closer to its sequels.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> CD-ROM2 version of <em>Valis II</em> is also drastically different from its PC98/MSX2 counterpart. Both were straightforward hack n' slash platformers, albeit with different level and boss designs, and the former version had the ability to voluntarily change Yuko's armor during gameplay, along with an MP bar instead of a preset number of uses for each spell.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zanac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zanac">Zanac</a></em> was originally released on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX">MSX</a> in several versions with blotchy graphics reminiscent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xevious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xevious">Xevious</a></em>, but was greatly reworked for the NES. The NES version was ported back to the MSX2 as <em>Zanac EX</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> became <em>four</em> different games by Ocean: one exclusively for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a>; another for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>; a third for 8-bit computers; and a fourth for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> and 16-bit consoles. At least all of these were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Games</a> starring Gomez Addams.
</li><li> <em>Alien 3</em> was released on the SNES and Genesis. Both games are vastly different in pacing, atmosphere and gameplay. The SNES version is a slower-paced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> that's lighter on gore but has more varied gameplay while the Genesis version offers more streamlined, tense gameplay and ratchets up the violence. Both good examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames">No Problem with Licensed Games</a>, but for totally different reasons. There is an NES version too, but it takes the majority of its cues from the Genesis version and feels more like a straightforward if stripped-down port.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> received two separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">licensed games</a> from Konami, one for the Super NES, one for the Genesis (which received a stripped-down Game Boy port courtesy of Factor 5). They share some gameplay elements and themes in common, but are otherwise completely different down to the plot, with the Genesis game being a much more traditional platformer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a> &amp; Obelix XXL 2</em> were released a year after the original PS2 and PC releases on handhelds. While the PSP version is the same game, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> couldn't handle it, so it was changed into a 2D mix of a platformer and brawler.
<ul><li> <em>Asterix at the Olympic Games</em> was identical between the PC and console version (bar some graphical differences), with the exception of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> release: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure">Action-Adventure</a> segments are removed entirely, leaving only the Olympic Games proper and making it a <em>Track &amp; Field</em> clone. There are, however, many more events than the ones found in the other versions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Astyanax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Astyanax">Astyanax</a></em> (aka <em>The Lord of King</em>) was released for the Arcade and NES at the same time, and both versions were completely different right down to their very plot. Whereas the hero in the arcade version was a medieval barbarian-like warrior who finds the legendary Fire Axe, the protagonist in the NES game is an ordinary high school student who is transported to a fantasy setting.
</li><li> <em>Batman</em> had a set of tie-in games made by Sunsoft based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">the 1989 film</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanSunsoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanSunsoft">The NES version</a>, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>-inspired platform game, was released first. While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> versions loosely followed the same template, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> version, which was originally announced as a platformer as well, was retooled into an overhead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MazeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MazeGame">Maze Game</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Batman: Return of the Joker</em> was released in two completely different versions for the NES and the Game Boy; the latter has a closer resemblance to the first NES <em>Batman</em> game. The NES <em>Return of the Joker</em> game was then ported to the Genesis by an American developer under the title of <em>Batman: <strong>Revenge</strong> of the Joker</em>. An SNES version was also planned, but canceled (a prototype ROM image is available online).
</li><li> The two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> games developed by Konami, one for the NES and the other for the SNES, were both side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, but that's where their similarities ended. Sega also released its own line of <em>Batman Returns</em> games for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a>, Genesis and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a>. The Sega CD version was a port of the Genesis version with added racing stages, while the Game Gear and Master System versions were almost identical.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BIONICLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BIONICLE">BIONICLE</a>: The Game</em> is a typical Third-Person Action-Adventure game on console and PC, with an extremely simplified version of the Bohrok and Mask of Light story arcs. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version has more emphasis on platforming, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Isometric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Isometric">Isometric-perspective</a>, features all thirteen Toa, has more levels, and does not even bother with a plot.
</li><li> <em>BIONICLE Heroes</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysOverTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysOverTheShoulder">Always Over the Shoulder</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter">Third-Person Shooter</a> on consoles and PC, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">barely coherent</a> version of the Voya Nui story arc.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> version is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> about an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">unnamed</a> silver Matoran-turned-Toa rescuing the Toa Inika, who have been captured by the Piraka and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Makuta</a>.
</li><li> The GBA version is a mixture of the two formulas above; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView">Top-Down View</a> Shooter about a silver Toa (who can transform into any of the Toa Mata, and later Nuva and Inika) rescuing the Inika from Vezon.

On the NES, it's a horror-themed Mario clone, complete with ? blocks. On 16-bit consoles, it's a more generic platform with oddly oversized bosses. On the Sega CD, Psygnosis made use of the CD-ROM technology to make a beat-'em-up with digitized backgrounds and FMV cutscenes. Finally, on PC, it's an FPS, if you can believe it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainAmericaAndTheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainAmericaAndTheAvengers">Captain America and the Avengers</a></em> was released simultaneously in arcades and on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NES">NES</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a> at the end of 1991. While the arcade version was a 4-player beat-'em-up where players could play as Cap, Iron Man, Hawkeye and The Vision, the NES version was a side-scrolling platform game where only Cap and Hawkeye were playable and their objective was to rescue the other two. Data East later released a port of the arcade game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> in 1992.
<ul><li> Mindscape later released a set of versions for the SNES, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>. While the SNES version was also a port of the arcade game, the portable versions were actually side-scrolling platformers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">Castlevania</a></em> (NES) and <em>Vampire Killer</em> (MSX2) were released in Japan under the same title (<em>Akumajō Dracula</em>) a month apart, with the same packaging art. While they have very similar stage designs, <em>Vampire Killer</em> focuses more on exploration, as the player's goal is to uncover hidden items in each stage and find the key to the stage's exit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a> is a top-down action RPG that was better received than the critically-panned computer FPS it was based on.
</li><li> <em>Daiva</em>, a space-themed war simulation game by T&amp;E Soft, was released for seven different platforms (all the major Japanese 8-bit computers plus the Famicom and PC98) throughout 1986 to 1987. Each version featured completely different scenario starring a different protagonist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy">Dizzy</a> Kwik Snax</em> is a completely different game on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> original. On the Spectrum version you have to push blocks to squash monsters on a single screen, on the Commodore version you have to collect Fluffles and guide them to the exit in a side-scrolling gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonaldDuckGoinQuackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonaldDuckGoinQuackers">Donald Duck: Goin' Qu@ckers</a></em> had several versions for multiple platforms.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a>, PC: practically the same, just some graphical improvements for the latter two, and cutscenes in pre-rendered CGI instead of the game's engine.
</li><li> PlayStation: obvious hit in the graphics but also completely different level design (3D and side-view sections alternate inside and not in separate levels), soundtrack and enemies.
</li><li> PS2 and GameCube: released a few years later, built on a new engine, complete renewal of the levels, an improved version of the PS1 version's soundtrack and new abilities for Donald.
</li><li> The handheld versions (Game Boy Color and Advance) are 2D Platformers and are also very different from each other, with the latter giving more abilities to Donald. Also the storyline plays a bit differently.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone</em> for the arcades and <em>Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones</em> for the NES shared a parallel development according to series's creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto. Technos outsourced development of the arcade version to East Technology and internally worked on the NES project. As a result, the NES version feels a very similar to previous games, while its arcade counterpart was a bit of a departure. The two versions mainly differed in the playable character roster and how players have access to them: the arcade version have the extra fighters (along with other power-ups such as more health and new moves) available as in-game purchases through item shops in the beginning of certain stages (essentially serving as an early form of micro-transactions), while the NES version has the player acquire two additional fighters (Chin Seimei and Yagyu Ranzou) by defeating them as bosses after the second and third stage respectively. A Japanese revision of the arcade game was later made that ditched the in-game purchases in favor of simply allowing each player to choose their fighter from four character types when starting the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> was originally released in Japan in two versions. The PS4 version was co-developed by Orca (who assisted in the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestX">Dragon Quest X</a></em> on various platforms) and runs on Unreal Engine 4 using a third-person camera, while the 3DS version was co-developed by Toylogic, and can either be played with more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> 3D models similar to the console version, or 2D sprites in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeQuartersView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeQuartersView">Three Quarters View</a> similar to the ones from SFC/DS Dragon Quest games. Only the PS4 version of the game was released overseas alongside a Steam port made speficially for the west, although the 2D was later implemented in <em>Dragon Quest XI S</em>, an expanded port released for the Switch.
</li><li> The sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife">Drawn to Life</a></em>, The Next Chapter, was released both on DS and Wii at the same time but was created by different developers: '5th Cell' and 'Planet Moon Studios'. Both games are extremely different in both tone, plot and gameplay. The DS version is more of a direct sequel to the original, but the Wii version has a more basic plot centred on collecting Artifacts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteHeaddy">Dynamite Headdy</a></em> had a Game Gear version developed in tandem with the Genesis/Mega Drive version. The Game Gear version was predictably a lot more basic, especially when comparing boss battles, and followed a different progression of levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FantasyZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FantasyZone">Fantasy Zone</a></em> was released on the Master System a few months after the arcade game, but both versions were actually developed at the same time. The Master System version was tailor-made to take into account the lower hardware specs and features different bosses, weapon properties and less enemy bases to destroy. The Famicom version later released by Sunsoft, along with a separately developed NES version by Tengen, both played like a mix between both versions.
</li><li> The Xbox release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a> 2</em> is, despite its name, a sequel to the concurrently-developed Gamecube / PS2 version.
</li><li> The different versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a> Advanced Warfighter</em> have the same storyline and use most of the same locations in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a>, but have very different gameplay mechanics.
<ul><li> The Xbox 360 version is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter">Third-Person Shooter</a> (with an optional weapon-less first person view), playing similarly to the aforementioned ''Ghost Recon 2', with added visual aids and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover">Take Cover!</a> mechanics.
</li><li> The PC version was outsourced to GRIN and runs on their proprietary Diesel engine. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> that plays similarly to the original PC <em>Ghost Recon</em>, allowing player to order their Ghosts individually (as opposed to the X360 version, where the player can only order their squad as a single unit) and set up complex battle plans, and features fairly unforgiving health and shooting mechanics. Some of the scenarios from the Xbox 360 version do not have equivalents and were replaced with news ones, and a new character was created to explain the mechanics and objectives exclusive to this version. GRIN would also handle the PC version of <em>Advanced Warfighter 2</em> and make it in a similar style.
</li><li> The original Xbox and PS2 versions are also a FPS, but a much more linear and arcade-like one. The player can only command up to one allied character at a time and protagonist Scott Mitchell, who is quite talkative in the other versions, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentProtagonist">mute</a> here. Furthermore, the PS2 and Xbox versions have different level layouts from each others.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Goemon: Shinseidai Shūmei</em> ("Goemon: The New Generation") for the PlayStation and <em>Goemon: New Age Shutsudō!!</em> (New Age Sailing) for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> were essentially the same game, being released two months apart. The two games were part of an unsuccessful attempt by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> to reinvent the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GanbareGoemon">Ganbare Goemon</a></em> franchise (aka <em>Mystical Ninja</em>) to younger players around 2001-2002. The GBA version is essentially a watered down version of the PS game, with text and still imagery instead of voice acted cutscenes, along with less stages, but it does have some exclusive content to make up for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em> on the MSX had similar gameplay to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Famicom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Famicom">Famicom</a> game, more primitive graphics, and very different levels. As with <em>Vampire Killer</em>, keys played a major role in the MSX version, which also added an EXP bar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins2TheNewBatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins2TheNewBatch">Gremlins 2: The New Batch</a></em> got two radically different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">Licensed Games</a>: a top-down action game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, and a typical sidescrolling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Game</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> had two radically different versions produced at the same time, one for PC, one for several home consoles including the PS2. The console version was far flashier, while the PC version focused more on an open-world Hogwarts. The former therefore got quite a few more cinematic moments, while the latter focused so much on creating atmosphere that the bigger scenes were necessarily a bit smaller. One example: Upon landing at Hogwarts, Harry needs to get past the Whomping Willow. The PC version has him walking around it in a circle as it lazily lifts and lowers its roots. The console version has a full-on boss fight against the tree, where it viciously pounds the earth and even throws the car at you. Another example: the Hogwarts of the PC version is littered with secret passages, sidequests, collectibles, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> to talk to. Needless to say, both versions have their fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> got a game on practically every console of the time, and all had vastly different gameplay styles. The SNES version combines a top-down shooter with rudimentary FPS segments, the Genesis version is a side-scroller, the Game Gear game is a totally different side scroller, and the NES and Game Boy games are stripped down version of the SNES edition, with the Game Boy one also throwing in a few side-scroller stages.
</li><li> <em>Kool-Aid Man</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a> and for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision">Intellivision</a> were two entirely different games, largely because Mattel had to produce both of them on a very tight schedule. The 2600 version is set around a swimming pool; the Intellivision version takes place inside a haunted house where two children have to summon the Kool-Aid Man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastActionHero">Last Action Hero</a></em> is a "good" example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">The Problem with Licensed Games</a> in all of its various releases, but it's interesting to see how very different it is on various platforms.
<ul><li> SNES / Genesis: a traditional side-scrolling action game with some side-view driving levels.
</li><li> NES: platform game with tiny sprites and some arcade levels.
</li><li> Game Boy / Game Gear: similar to the 16 bit counterparts, but the driving stages are now overhead.
</li><li> DOS: Overhead free-roaming driving stages (predating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a> by some years - you can even run pedestrians over!) and side-view fighting levels. It even has some small clips from the movie.
</li><li> Amiga: based on the assets of the DOS versions, an entirely different game was crafted from them - a scrolling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> with no driving levels.
</li><li> Finally, there was a Sega CD version in the works, which was supposed to use some retouched assets from the DOS version along with pre-rendered backgrounds and cutscenes. Given the lukewarm success of the movie and the other games, it was quietly cancelled.
</li></ul></li><li> The handheld versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro">The Legend of Spyro</a></em> series tended to be quite different from their console counterparts, and for reasons beyond their technically inferior hardware. The DS version of one game in the series included a whole minigame of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightAndMirrorsPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightAndMirrorsPuzzle">Light And Mirrors Puzzles</a> not found anywhere in the console versions. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version of the second game also featured a more platforming and exploration-oriented game than the console versions, and, in fact, got higher reviews than every other version of the game despite being on the least-advanced system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland">Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</a></em> had two games produced by Capcom. The arcade version was simply titled <em>Nemo</em>, while the NES version was titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNemoTheDreamMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNemoTheDreamMaster">Little Nemo: The Dream Master</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</a></em> series. All the games (bar Sochi 2014) have a console version and a handheld version. The ones with the most drastic differences would be London 2012 since the Wii version was like the first 2 games allowing you to play as any character in any sport with each sport presented in a form similar to their real life counterparts while the 3DS version only had 4 characters playable per sport (Heroes, Girls, Wild Ones, Tricksters &amp; Challengers being the five character types) with some sports being like their real life counterparts while others just taking a small part of the sport and turning them in to quick-fire minigames.
</li><li> The Game Boy Advance version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> is a 2D overhead isometric shooter that tries to follow the original game as closely as possible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> received a series of tie-in games around the time the first season ended. Although the versions released for the Nintendo platforms were published by Bandai, the Sega versions were first-party products. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNES">Super NES</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> versions were both side-scrolling action games, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> versions were fighting games, each completely unique. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> version was also released which was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveMovie">Interactive Movie</a> game which used FMV clips from key episodes of the series.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">MMPR: The Movie</a></em> also received its own sets of tie-in games. While the SNES, Game Boy and Game Gear versions were similar to their respective predecesors, the Genesis version was a side-scrolling beat-'em-up that actually covered both, the events of the film and the latter half of Season 2.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MichaelJacksonsMoonwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MichaelJacksonsMoonwalker">Michael Jackson's Moonwalker</a></em> was released for the Genesis/Mega Drive and arcades at around the same time by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>. They had some common elements, but the former was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shinobi">Shinobi</a></em>-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Game</a>, whereas the latter was an isometric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> that could be played by up to three people (each controlling a palette swapped MJ).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a> Hot Pursuit 2</em> was similar on both the GameCube, Windows PC, and Xbox, but those versions were markedly different from (and generally not as good as) the PlayStation 2 version.
</li><li> <em>Need For Speed Hot Pursuit</em>, the 2010 version, the Wii version is instead a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission-Pack Sequel</a> to NFS Nitro with downgraded environment details but slightly upgraded car models.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em> was simultaneously produced for the arcade and NES by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tecmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tecmo">Tecmo</a>, and ultimately two completely different games were created. While the arcade version is a 2-player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat 'em Up</a> with emphasis on acrobatic moves (the joystick had an action button on top for grabbing ledges), the NES version is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>-style side-scrolling platformer with a wall hanging play mechanic and cinematic sequences between stages.
<ul><li> The later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> and unreleased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> versions all claim to be "reprogrammed" versions, yet each one is an original game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheForgottenSands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheForgottenSands">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands</a></em>. While the 360/PS3/PC versions are the same game, the Wii version has a different storyline and different powers for the Prince. The PSP and DS versions are 2.5D platformers with yet each having their own storylines.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> is a 2D platformer on the GBA, whereas the console/PC versions are 3D.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo</a></em> had two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG">Action RPGs</a> based on the second film (<em>Rambo: First Blood Part II</em>) released by Pack-In Video. The MSX game plays in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopDownView">Top-Down View</a> similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hydlide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hydlide">Hydlide</a></em>, while the NES game is a side-scroller similar to <em>Zelda II</em>.
<ul><li> While Ocean Software obtained the <em>Rambo III</em> license from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito">Taito</a>, the game they ended up releasing for various computer platforms was an overhead shooter that played nothing like the arcade game Taito eventually released, which was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cabal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cabal">Cabal</a></em>-style shooter where Player 2 controlled Colonel Trautman.
</li><li> Sega also produced its own set of <em>Rambo III</em> games for its consoles. While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> version of <em>Rambo III</em> was an overhead action shooter, the Master System version was an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf">Operation Wolf</a></em>-style light gun game that required the Light Phaser gun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a> 3</em>, despite using some design elements from the PC version, have a completely different story and vastly different gameplay on the Xbox and PS2, being mostly linear single-squad FPS's rather than plan-based with multiple teams.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ristar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ristar">Ristar</a></em> was originally released on the Genesis/Mega Drive, with a lesser-known Game Gear version coming out around the same time. Much like the <em>Sonic</em> examples below, hardware limitations resulted in radically different level layouts and the addition of a new world, Planet Terra (replacing Undertow and Scorch).
</li><li> <em>RollerGames</em> was a short-lived rollerskating TV show that received two separate video game adaptations by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>. The arcade version attempted to adapt the sport itself into a video game, whereas the NES version was a side-scrolling action game that barely had anything to do with the sports save for the names of the teams (the enemies included molotov-throwing punks, a flying gunship and a Shaolin monk as the final boss).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> received completely different adaptations for the SNES and Genesis. The SNES game, by Beam Software, is an isometric action RPG starring an amnesiac named Jake, while the Genesis game, developed by Blue Sky Software, is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>-style overhead RPG with a protagonist named Joshua avenging the death of his brother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame">The Simpsons Game</a></em> was developed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a>. The DS version is the most radically different game of them all, being a 2D sidescroller instead of a 3D platformer.
</li><li> The mobile version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> uses the same characters and graphics as the console version but, due to the nature of mobile devices, requires a completely different control scheme and thus different gameplay as well. Because Lab Zero doesn't have the resources to work on the mobile game <em>and</em> their current projects, development was outsourced to Hidden Variable Games, and they wound up crafting a mostly separate story from the original version.
</li><li> The first five <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders">Skylanders</a></em> games had companion titles for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, which were compatible with the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices">toys-to-life figures</a> as the console versions but had completely different gameplay and plots. For game five, <em>SuperChargers</em>, the Wii version qualified as well, being the same as the 3DS version rather than the other console versions. Averted as of the sixth game, <em>Imaginators</em>, where there is only the one version for consoles and no portable companion.
</li><li> This has been a pretty common process in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> had 8-bit versions produced for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>, both of which were radically different from the 16-bit originals on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> (the 8-bit versions of <em>Sonic 2</em> actually preceded the 16-bit version in some regions). The more limited hardware didn't allow for the same speed, which resulted in different level layouts, premises and soundtracks. The 8-bit <em>Sonic 2</em> in particular is pretty much a <em>completely different game</em> from the Mega Drive one, with completely different levels, enemies and even a <em>very</em> different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mxj3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mxj3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mxj3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Tails is captured and needs to be rescued in the 8-bit version, thereby leaving him as an NPC, whereas he's a playable character in the 16-bit version and follows Sonic around by default</span>; Sonic 1 shares some of its levels between versions, albeit in modified form. Both still hold up well, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> versions in particular are considered more challenging due to their lower screen resolution and general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">lack of rings during boss fights</a>.
</li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DBlast">Sonic 3D Blast</a></em> was in production (with pretty similar 16-bit and Sega Saturn versions), another department was working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBlast">Sonic Blast</a></em> (not to be confused with the above-mentioned <em>Sonic Blast Man</em>). The only things they have in common are that Sonic, Eggman, and Knuckles are in both of them. They are otherwise totally different, with different stages, soundtracks, story, and types of platformer (the former being a non-linear 3-D platformer, and the latter being a traditional linear 2-D platformer). In fact, even the original titles were different, being <em>Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island</em> and <em>G Sonic</em> respectively.
</li><li> Due to power difference between the different hardware, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> had two versions in development: 360/PS3 and PS2/Wii. The second had downgraded graphics, no free roaming town areas, shorter and more basic day levels, less worlds and more (infamous) Werehog levels, but also better controls and a more stable framerate.
</li><li> Between 2010 and 2014, as Sonic Team worked on a main series Sonic game for home systems, Dimps would simultaneously develop a game sharing the title, soundtrack, and story on Nintendo handheld systems. This was the approach to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld">Sonic Lost World</a></em>. In all three cases, Dimps would receive basic information, music, and gameplay suggestions from Sonic Team, then Dimps would create their own interpretation. For Dimps's <em>Sonic Colors</em> and <em>Sonic Generations</em>, the gameplay closely resembled that of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRush">Sonic Rush</a></em> games they previously worked on, though for <em>Sonic Lost World</em>, it was in full 3-D with their own stage layouts and gimmicks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpankysQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpankysQuest">Spanky's Quest</a></em>: The Game Boy and SNES versions were developed by two completely different teams, and have almost entirely different approaches to level design and bonus items. The SNES version requires the player to collect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAntimatterKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAntimatterKeys">Interchangeable Antimatter Keys</a>, whereas the Game Boy version has neither keys nor doors. It's little wonder that the two versions were released under different titles in Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures">Sparkster</a></em> was completely different between the SNES and Genesis, despite being released at the same time, having the same cover artwork and almost the same title (the Genesis version was subtitled <em>Rocket Knight Adventures 2</em> in Japan).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> on consoles is a great free-roaming game and is considered among the best titles (if not <em>the best</em>) based on the wall crawler. The PC version by another developer, unfortunately, is a lousy, limited action game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></em> - Unlike the main console version, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>, the PS2/PSP version was a 2D brawler, the DS version was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> (the engine of which would later be reused for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManShatteredDimensions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManShatteredDimensions">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</a></em>). Each of these versions features its own storyline and more Marvel characters than the free-roaming one for the "bigger" systems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie">Street Fighter: The Movie</a></em> was a completely different game on consoles from the arcade game released two months earlier, despite using the same digitized sprites. The arcade version was developed by Incredible Technologies (makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeKillers">Time Killers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodStorm">BloodStorm</a></em>) and drew many gameplay elements from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a> series (such as tap motions for special moves, which were unusual for <em>Street Fighter</em> at the time), whereas the console version was developed in-house by Capcom and ran on a modified version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a></em> engine. Even the character roster was different between both versions, as Blade and the rest of the Bison Troopers were exclusive to the arcade version, whereas the console versions featured Dee-Jay and Blanka.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em> was one game made for two vastly different sets of hardware, those being the titular handheld and home console. Care was taken to make sure both versions played the same and had the same character roster - the restrictions of the less-powerful 3DS hardware meant certain characters had to be changed or cut, even on the Wii U - but both had exclusive stages and secondary game modes (Smash Run on 3DS, Smash Tour on Wii U). Plus, the Wii U version supports up to eight players (whereas the 3DS is limited to four) and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">Level Editor</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider">Strider</a></em> was produced as a collaboration between Capcom and Motomiya Kikaku that resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider">one-volume manga</a> and two video games, a console version for the Famicom and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade">arcade version</a> for the CP System hardware. The <em>Strider</em> arcade game is easily the most successful of these projects, being ported to a variety of other platforms such as the Genesis, X68000, PC Engine and PlayStation years after its original release, despite deviating completely from the other versions of the <em>Strider</em> story. The manga has never been reprinted since its original 1988 publication and is nowadays only known to hardcore Strider fans, while the Famicom version was inexplicably canceled in Japan despite being announced before the arcade version, although it did see a U.S. release on the NES.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> on the NES came out almost at the same time as Konami's popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheArcadeGame">arcade beat-'em-up</a> of the same title. When Konami decided to adapt the arcade game to the NES as well, they had to retitle that version <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game</em> to make it clear that it was a different game from the first NES title and a port of the arcade version.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTournamentFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTournamentFighters">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters</a></em> was a title used for a set of Konami fighting games released for the NES, SNES and Genesis at the end of 1993. Each version was a unique game featuring its own character roster and fighting system. Each version also used one of the turtles as a cover character, but because there four turtles, but only three versions of the game made, Michelangelo was the one that was not afforded this privilege.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> versions of Konami's first two <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> games based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">2003 series</a>, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> version of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare</em>, were completely different games from their PC and console counterparts.
</li><li> When Ubisoft got a hold of the <em>Turtles</em> license, they made a series of tie-in games based on CGI <em>TMNT</em> movie for various platforms. The PC and home console versions were ports of the same game, but the portable versions for the GBA, DS and PSP were all unique. The GBA version in particular, rather than being a 3D action game like the others, was a 2D beat-'em-up inspired by the older Konami games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Tenchi o Kurau</em> (The Devouring of Heaven and Earth), Hiroshi Motomiya's manga adaptation of the <em>Three Kingdoms</em> tale, was adapted into video game format by Capcom. Like <em>Willow</em> and <em>Nemo</em>, they released two games at the same time: the arcade version was a side-scrolling action game where players fought enemies while riding on a horseback, whereas the Famicom version was an RPG similar to <em>Dragon Quest</em>. Both games were released overseas under the titles of <em>Dynasty Wars</em> and <em>Destiny of an Emperor</em> respectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 3</em> and <em>4</em> both had different versions, one for the PS2/Xbox/GCN, and one for the PS1 with different goals and levels, done by different companies. The same thing happened again with the PS360 version of <em>Project Eight</em> and <em>Proving Ground</em> being different to the Wii/PS2 version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron">Transformers: War for Cybertron</a></em> was a third-person shooter released for the PS3 and Xbox 360. <em>Transformers: Cybertron Adventures</em>, considered to be the Wii equivalent and having the same characters and story, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailShooter">Rail Shooter</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turrican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turrican">Turrican</a></em> originally began development as a Commodore 64 game by Rainbow Arts. Factor 5, who were working on the Amiga version, originally planned their version as a straight port, but then they decided to rework the game completely in order to utilize the Amiga's specs to its full potential. <em>Turrican 2</em> was developed in a similar matter.
<ul><li> Similarly <em>Super Turrican</em> was released for consoles in two versions. While the NES version handled by Rainbow Arts, the SNES version was done by Factor 5.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow">Willow</a></em> was a side-scrolling platform game in arcades, where the player alternates between controlling Willow and Madmartigan and was pretty faithful to the movie's plot. The NES version was an action RPG that took liberties with the source material.
</li><li> <em>World Destruction League</em>: <em>Thunder</em> Tanks and <em>War Jetz</em> were both released simultaneously for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>. The two versions have different levels and controls, especially in the case of <em>War Jetz</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenMutantApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenMutantApocalypse">X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse</a></em> for the SNES was released at the same month (December 1994) as the arcade fighting game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenChildrenOfTheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenChildrenOfTheAtom">X-Men: Children of the Atom</a></em>. Despite the fact that both games were made by Capcom, they're completely different games.
<ul><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroesWarOfTheGems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroesWarOfTheGems">Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems</a></em> may seem like an example of this, it actually came out almost a year after the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroes">Marvel Super Heroes</a></em> arcade game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YieArKungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YieArKungFu">Yie Ar Kung Fu</a></em> on the MSX and Famicom are completely different from the arcade original. They feature completely new opponents for the players, a completely new stage and different victory poses, including a new pose for the FC version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> IV</em> was developed at the same time for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperFamicom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperFamicom">Super Famicom</a>. Both versions were developed by separate companies based on a rough outline provided by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NihonFalcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NihonFalcom">Nihon Falcom</a>, who developed the prior <em>Ys</em> games. There was also a third version planned for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> that ended up being canceled.
