The Strategist is often in a supporting role, but may be the hero as well.
</p><p>In a supporting role, the Strategist is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a> on turbo, although he or she will—as a general rule—be less likely to physically partake in any of the plans they think up. The heroes may come to rely on The Strategist for their ultimate success, and, as such, will have to protect and keep The Strategist as far away from the front lines as possible. The loss of The Strategist might come across as an unmitigated disaster, should the heroes come to rely on his or her advice too much. Also, there's no guarantee that The Strategist won't turn out to also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>, manipulating both the heroes and the villains towards some mysterious and personal goal. This will almost never be the case, however, as The Strategist very rarely wants power for him- or herself; the sheer joy of being given a venue where they can stretch their intellectual muscles and try out their plans is often reward enough for their loyalty and service.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The Strategist may also take center stage. As a hero, The Strategist's clever tactical tricks drive the story. A main character Strategist will face overwhelming odds, again and again. The enemy may have difficulty believing The Strategist can possibly win — after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ErfWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ErfWorld">they're outnumbered 25 to 1 and have a moron for a boss</a>! But by bending the rules a little, dusting off their knowledge of military history, and maybe pulling a few dirty tricks, The Strategist comes out on top, or at least alive. They can become the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu">Mary Tzu</a></strong> if done poorly.
</p><p>The Strategist may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius">TV Genius</a> tendencies, but they will just as often be charismatic, knowing that, by acting so, they'll have an easier time convincing others to follow their plans.
</p><p>In several sport series, The Strategist will be a highly-talented player who also devises strategies or helps the coach do so. Often, said characters have weak health, so they're only allowed to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">for a limited time</a>, or aren't called into the games unless the team is in a tight pinch. They're also likely to hold quite the degree of power inside of the team, possibly as captains or assistants...if not <em>coaches</em>.

</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu">Mary Tzu</a>, when the character is unrealistically good at strategy. In games, players who want to be Strategists are a widely recognised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes">Player Archetype</a>, making this a sister trope to other such archetypes; naturally, some are better planners than others.

<ul><li> Sanji in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is this for the Straw Hats, having proven time and time again to be an expert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a> player. The Little Garden, Alabasta, Skypeia, Water 7, Enies Lobby, and Zou arcs all have solid examples of him displaying this skill.
</li><li> The Daikenja (aka Murata) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> was the Shinou's strategist during his first life who helped him win the war against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Shoushu</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Although her job isn't advisory, Tsunade of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> was sought by Jiraiya and Naruto for similar reasons and in the same manner. Not surprisingly, Shikamaru seems to have taken this role and has become Tsunade's strategist.
<ul><li> More recently, we found out who Shikamaru gets it from; Shikaku, his dad, is Jounin Commander of Konoha, and is acting as Tsunade's right-hand man, helping to coordinate the movements of various divisions. Not only that, he even creates a perfect strategy that manages to drive the Juubi into a corner.
</li></ul></li><li> Zero in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> of the common scenario, he seeks out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> rather than the other way around, and he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> on top of that. Played straight with Zero getting Todoh to join the Black Knights. There's also a bit more screwing around in that quite often, he's involved in fights as well. On one occasion, he started a chess game by moving his King. When questioned about it later, he responds, "If the King doesn't lead, his subjects won't follow." It's also good to note that Zero's ulterior ambitions aren't all that different from the resistance, they want to liberate Japan, he wants to overthrow the Empire occupying it, it's largely a matter of scale.
</li></ul><ul><li> Niijima of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>. He's the only member of the Shinpaku Alliance (other than the flag-bearer) with no fighting ability. Despite this, his ability to come up with (usually ridiculous) plans to save everyone else from even the direst situations is admirable (even though he's usually the one responsible for the crisis at hand), to the point that even Kenichi's masters are impressed with his strategic ability.
</li></ul><ul><li> Out of all the trainers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, Miguel Zail makes the best use of tactical decisions, always observing the enemy boxer in order to give the right commands. Two other examples for boxers are Kenta Kobashi, who makes up for his lack of boxing talent by studying his opponent beforehand and developing strategies against him and world champion David Eagle, who also uses strategy in his fight, but more on a psychological level.
</li><li> Narsus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em> plays the trope to a T. He used to be an adviser to King Andragoras III but was expelled from the court because he kept asking the king to abolish slavery. For three years he'd been living in his remote countryside home painting and drinking. When Andragoras is defeated and the kingdom faces occupation, his old friend Daryoon appears at his place with the crown prince and demands that Narsus help them. At first, Narsus wants nothing to do with it, but then he realizes prince Arslan's potential and willingly becomes his adviser and strategist. (Arslan promising him the title of royal painter if he gets back the throne didn't hurt.) Just to clarify: Narsus had a very fine control of understanding and manipulating circumstances, sometimes to ludicrous degrees. His debut strategy was to pinpoint the most likely thrust of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>'s plan to smoke Prince Arslan out of hiding, then counter that by having the prince lure Lusitanian soldiers to his position, which was on a hilltop...near a massive floodgate, which is promptly thrown open to have the Lusitanians' massive numerical advantage literally washed away.
</li><li> Tanaka Yoshiki seems to like these — in addition to the Arslan example above, he has Yang Wenli, Reinhard von Lohengramm and Paul von Oberstein from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>. Yang is a drunk slob who would much rather laze around and study history than go into battle but he is the smartest strategist in the series, Reinhard is a Napoleon-like conqueror and a genius at military and politics, and Oberstein is a brilliant Machiavellian schemer in Reinhard's service.
</li><li> Gendo Ikari of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> is one. Aside from the examples on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">screwing with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">the plotline</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilofVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilofVagueness">SEELE</a>, he doesn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">see things coming</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">he provides the super-subtle pushes that puts people where he wants them</a>. He even has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">layout of NERV nearly randomized</a> to discourage intruders. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this doesn't work out very well if you're up against people with intimate knowledge of the base or 13 years of planning, or in failing to notice that the one person his plans hinged on was on the verge of rebelling against him and in favor of his son</span>.
</li><li> Shiroe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em> did not earn the nickname "Shiroe the Strategist" for nothing. His in-game class is an enchanter-type wizard, but his spells are largely supportive and are usually the key to bring his plans to fruition and his allies to victory.
</li><li> Kakuri in <em>Bokko</em>. When the small border city of Ryo is threatened by a large invading army, they send a request for help to their ancient allies, the clan of Bokk. They send a single man to save the city. Which he proceeds to do, in spite of seemingly insurmountable problems.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair">Corsair</a></em>, Canale is the chief strategist for Preveza, a pirate clan. It's probably the only thing that offers him any protection, as his refusal to actually fight (despite the fact that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">blind</a>) is highly contentious for the other pirates.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is technically the role that Heymans Breda occupies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Roy Mustang's</a> team. Mustang himself is a Badass Strategist, but recognized that Breda's abilities in this field were well above average, and recruited him for the group.
</li><li> Ling Yao is also an excellent strategist and quickly figures out the best way to fight his enemy. His strategy allows him to keep up with even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">Fuhrer Bradley</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a> </em>: Give Daisuke Aramakitwo street punks and he can make a SWAT team look like such fools that the "Special" in "Special Weapons And Tactics" seems to mean they ride to the crime scene in a short bus. Give him his handpicked team of specialists and it won't matter if you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">the world's last super power</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">You Are Already Dead</a>.
</li><li> Matsu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em> is extremely intelligent but not a fighter like most other Sekireis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> has Captain William Sutherland, who devises most of the Earth Forces' battle plans and serves as Muruta Azrael's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">right-hand man</a>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> has another evil Strategist in the form of M'quve who created most of Kycillia Zabi's plans, and led the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">White Base</a></em> crew around by the nose during most of their encounters. The end result of M'quve getting annoyed at the <em>White Base</em> advancing toward his rear positions while he's preparing for the impending Federation offensive on another front? The <em>White Base</em> crippled by time bombs they had absolutely no idea where they came from. Luckily for them, the only time M'quve actually got serious in dealing with them was when he decided to fight the Gundam, with his tactical skills ultimately proving no match for Amuro's sheer piloting abilities and the encounter costing him his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> has two: Sumeragi Lee Noriega is Celestial Being's tactical forecaster, and her ability to predict the enemy's moves serves the Gundam Meisters <em>very</em> well during the first season. In the second season the A-LAWS recruit Colonel Kati Mannequin, a former classmate of Sumeragi's, to serve as their own forecaster; Kati recognizes Celestial Being's tactics almost immediately.

<ul><li> Of all this guys, the ones who fully classifies as this trope (as they are not only very good at war but are also searched and brought out of retirement in the moment of need) are Napoleon, Kutuzov and Clauzewitz: Napoleon had been kicked out of the army for political reasons, only to be recalled in service and given command of the Reserve Army to defeat a royalist insurrection (the insurrection spontaneously imploded when Napoleon started firing artillery inside Paris); general Kutuzov was an accomplished soldier who had fallen out of favor with the czar, Alexander I, and got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassigned to the war against the Turks</a> purely due old age and because combat wounds had disfigured him, but when Napoleon invaded and commander in chief De Tolly screwed up the scorched earth strategy (the lack of engagements was killing the morale of the army) the czar had to call Kutuzov, who restored the morale of the army with a major but inconclusive battle and organizing a guerrilla campaign to further harass Napoleon; Clausewitz was a mere major who had left the Prussian Army and joined Russia to fight Napoleon, but when Napoleon won the early battles of the Sixth Coalition War the Prussians searched him specifically because they knew he had put into theory what Napoleon had done by improvisation, and thus was able to dissect the abilities of Napoleon's army and establish a surefire way to defeat him (four battles later Napoleon was on the run, and had not been captured or killed only because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">saw he was losing hard and decided to retreat</a>).

Due to growing up without a Quirk to guide him along, he spent obsessive amounts of time pouring over the Quirks and techniques used by others. Because of this, he's an expert at crafting battle plans that draw out the full potential of other's Quirks even after getting one of his own. These plans often involve being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">Crazy Enough to Work</a>, like having Uraraka use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a> powers to make him weightless while another of his classmates uses her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongTongue">Overly Long Tongue</a> to slingshot him after a villain that was outrunning all of them. But this strength is also one of his greatest weaknesses, as his tendency to try and plan ahead slows him down in the midst of a heated fight and those who don't give him the chance to think can overwhelm him.
<ul><li> Then there's Principal Nedzu, whose Quirk makes him a super-intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">Uplifted Animal</a>. During a test where he's pitted against Kaminari and Ashido, both of whom have good combat quirks that can be deadly at close range, Nedzu avoids them without ever even leaving his seat, using a crane with a wrecking ball to set off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">Disaster Dominoes</a> that herd the duo exactly where he wants them to go until time runs out.

She and her squad target Momo Yaoyorozu's group, luring them into a trap which locks them in a sealed room that gradually gets colder and colder. However, while her plan to make Momo use up her creation powers to plug the vents is a very sound one, and very nearly succeeds, she turns out to not be very flexible in her thinking and has nothing prepared when Momo eschews the "safe" tactic for an all-or-nothing offensive strategy.

Then Daeron the Young Dragon using a land-army without dragons achieved the impossible and took over Dorne, invading by land and sea simultaneously and forcing a surrender which might have worked had Daeron worked better to integrate the defeated into his kingdom and not made his conquest resemble an occupation.
</li><li> Tywin Lannister is a very cautious man who builds his power by means of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> and as a master of diplomacy and subterfuge. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> in most respects, a military general who never won a battle outnumbered, was humiliated by Euron Greyjoy's raid on Lannisport in the past, and is utterly outfoxed by Robb Stark on the field, managing to triumph by means of a lucky break thanks to Edmure Tully going rogue on Robb's orders and his son Tyrion Lannister defending King's Landing. He is a brilliant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpportunisticBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpportunisticBastard">Opportunistic Bastard</a> who is capable of capitalizing and maximizing his and his House's advantage despite not doing as much as other houses (such as when he sat out of Robert's Rebellion but came at the end to sack King's Landing under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>). He's quite good at holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall">Advantage Ball</a> and ruthless in his refusal to offer quarter and margin for error. However his brutality is deconstructed as in the long-term it means his family has trouble maintaining control and are despised for their cruelty.
</li><li> Robb Stark is both a brilliant tactician and a strategist. In the early part of the War of the Five Kings, he was cunningly able to outfox Tywin Lannister's strategy and hopes for a quick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> by giving him a feint. Robb then turns around and captures Tywin's son, Jaime Lannister instead, netting a valuable hostage who he can use to negotiate a quick end from a favorable position. This would have worked had King Joffrey not killed Ned Stark, which turned a small war into a longer one, where Robb ends up consistently winning every battle. He once again wrongfoots Tywin by failing to fall into his trap of meeting him at Harrenhal by instead marching west. Most of the time, Robb was able to dictate terms of engagement to Tywin and his campaign came undone because of a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a> on his part: sending Theon Greyjoy to the Iron Islands, and even then his strategy to undo Tywin came because his subordinate Edmure Tully exceeded his command. However there were numerous other factors that brought him down, such as one of his main commanders Rickard Karstark sending his troops away to hunt for Jaime and another of his main commanders Roose Bolton likely plotting against him from the start.
</li><li> Stannis Baratheon is considered the best all-around strategist of Westeros. He defended his castle during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">The Siege</a> in the backstory from a hundred times his numbers, won the largest naval battle in Westerosi history at Fair Isle, and mounted two successful amphibious naval campaigns, against Great Wyk and Dragonstone respectively. Even when he was countered by the equally brilliant Tyrion Lannister once Stannis laid siege on King's Landing at the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis came very close to victory and breaching the city, smashing the enemy force and putting them to rout in a matter of hours (he did have a 2-1 numerical advantage and better-trained troops, but they had a strong defensive position and magical napalm, yet it was STILL a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in his favor). He would have easily succeeded had it not been for Tywin Lannister's timely alliance with the Tyrells and his fortuitous proximity to the road leading to King's Landing at the time of his defeat at the hands of Edmure Tully. It's even mentioned that his ships were delayed by the winds, meaning that better winds likely would have enabled him to win. Later, Stannis defeats a wildling army in attack, despite being outnumbered 20-1 (his troops are far better trained and equipped, but the sheer ease with which he wins is impressive nonetheless). Currently he's set to pull victory from the jaws of defeat for his numerically superior but massively outmatched force at the Battle of the Ice, most likely by using an ice lake to his advantage against the enemy's heavy cavalry...

As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a>, he is able to analyze the strengths and shortcomings of the wildlings in order to defend against their leader's plans to attack the Wall. As Lord Commander, Jon's knowledge of wildling customs and culture allows him to both ally with the wildlings so they can defend against the true enemy — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">the Others</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">together</a>, and so he can successfully bring them south of the Wall to save them from this threat. He likewise makes plans to help secure sustenance for everyone being sheltered at the Wall through winter (planning glass gardens, managing to get a crucial loan, etc.), makes every effort to study this undead threat so they can better know how to fight it, and institutes reforms to rebuild and strengthen the Wall's defenses. Jon also gives crucial strategic advice to Stannis Baratheon, outlining an effective approach that saves Stannis from an early defeat and allows him to secure alliances with various Northern clans who can fight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">harsh weather conditions</a>, increasing Stannis's strength military strength in his quest to liberate Winterfell from the Boltons.

Horus and Robute Guilliman would be the runners-up.

<ul><li> Shu has Zhuge Liang, Pang Tong, Xu Shu, and Fa Zheng.
<ul><li> Jiang Wei, true to history, tries to be this but fails pretty miserably.
</li></ul></li><li> Wu has Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lu Meng (sort of), and Lu Xun.
</li><li> Wei has Guo Jia, Jia Xu, and Xun Yu. In Wei's hypothetical route in 8, Xu Shu also defects to Wei.
<ul><li> Sima Yi was the 'main' strategist for Wei until the Jin faction was introduced, after which point this role was taken by Guo Jia and Jia Xu.
</li></ul></li><li> Jin has Sima Yi and Jia Chong.
<ul><li> Sima Yi's sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao both have an almost innate understanding of tactics, though each with their own flaws. Shi is inflexible, and Zhao is lazy.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the "Other" characters, Chen Gong served as Lu Bu's strategist even as a generic NPC. As of 8: Xtreme Legends, he's been upgraded to a full character and takes a more prominent role as this.

</li><li> Sakon Shima for Shingen Takeda, and then for Mitsunari Ishida.

One of the few advantages Humanity had against the Covenant during the war was how the latter stubbornly refused to use innovative tactics against the former, relying on the sheer technological edge and overpowering legions. Thel 'Vadam was among the few leaders in the Covenant who ignored this handicap by matching/often surpassing the human strategists with unpredictability, leading to multiple victories against them, and he likely would have been one of the driving forces behind humanity's extinction if he hadn't pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.

</li><li> On the human side, Admiral Preston Cole is considered one of the main reasons why humanity lasted as long as it did against the vastly superior Covenant; he never lost a major battle, and his battle record is considered even more impressive than those of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Spartan-IIs</a>.

</li><li> The demon Azmodan from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> franchise is described as one of the finest battlefield commanders in Hell, possibly all of Creation, who has honed his knowledge of warfare through millennia of battles between demons and angels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">The key words there being "described as"</a>.

<ul><li> Makes more sense when you consider he is the Aspect of Sin, namely, <em>Pride</em>. He assumes he has already won once he invades Sanctuary, and all that's happening is the mop-up of Sanctuary's remaining defenders, when in fact he's actually battling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">their real army</a>.

</li><li> Contrary to <em>popular</em> belief (which does not mean <em>educated</em>), Stonewall Jackson was a strategist bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>. He believed that "If [his own men] don't understand what [he's] planning, the enemy will never figure it out." And they never did. This is the man who inspired the phrase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">"Crazy like a fox".</a>
<ul><li> This is a quote from the commander of the Union Army:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>General Hooker</strong>: "Jackson's movement, if not an accident, was eccentric and reprehensible, as no-one would be justified in anticipating its success. The movement was an unheard-of one, and under the circumstances, admitted not a ray of probability of successful execution. 99 chances out of a hundred, General Jackson's Corps would have been destroyed. It is for such movements that Jackson will ever be considered an unsafe person to place in command of armies."
</div><ul><li> Note, Hooker is the general that <em><strong>lost</strong></em>. Jackson's strategy in this battle resulted in General Lee defeating 135,000 men with a force of only 65,000 (about 2-to-1 against).
<ul><li> That is because Lee and Jackson had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">Nerves of Steel</a>, and were able to press forward with their strategy effectively. While Hooker had (to make an unfairly hyperbolic but revealing comparison) nerves of pasta.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While many have dismissed another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a> general, Ulysses Grant, as being limited to only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>, he was in reality a handy strategist. His battles in the Eastern Theater of the war and during the Vicksburg Campaign would not have been won just by using raw numbers of troops, no matter what his critics like to say. Furthermore, while Robert E. Lee was a battlefield general skilled in winning individual battles, Grant was a big-picture strategist who could take all his nation's forces in his plans and have the skill and will to use them through a series of battles to most effectively win the war.
</li><li> As listed above in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> entry, the Three Kingdoms era had many, though several famous figures are either overhyped or flatout misrepresented in fiction. Notably, Zhuge Liang was a pretty terrible commander and strategist. His two military achievements are having an army surrender to him after his two flank commanders defeated most of it already and "capturing" two counties Cao Cao had purposefully depopulated in order to create a buffer of dead land to make invasions from Hanzhong more difficult to launch and to make a success. He also engaged in harmful cronyism, favouring his political allies over genuinely skilled commanders like Wei Yan.
<ul><li> Wei had many. Most notable were Sima Yi and Jia Xu. Cao Cao himself was a highly accomplished commander who helped revive the then unpopular Art of War, providing an extensive annotation. Guo Jia died fairly young, but was well respected regardless. In later years, Deng Ai was a major force on the Western front with an uncanny ability to predict and intercept enemy movements through his excellent knowledge of terrain.
</li><li> Wu had Zhou Yu and Lv Meng among others. While Zhou Yu was instrumental in Sun Ce &amp; Sun Quan's campaigns that lead to the founding of Wu, he died before Jing province could be settled. Lv Meng's lack of scholarship was so notorious he was known as "the country bumpkin of Wu" until Sun Quan encouraged him to take up studying. He then soon became one of Wu's most respected scholars and added tactical genius to his already incredible military ability. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08y4j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08y4j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08y4j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two Chinese proverbs were derived from him and his experiences. One was "Wu xia A'Meng" (吴下阿蒙), used to describe an ignorant person, and "Shi bie san ri, dang gua mu xiang kan" （士别三日，当刮目相看）, used to praise someone who has made great improvement since the speaker last saw the person.</span> He was notable for winning battles without even fighting. Most notably, he took all of Liu Bei's holdings in Jing from Guan Yu without a single pitched battle or active siege.
</li><li> Shu did have some good strategic men, but they died fairly young and longer-lived commanders have been given this reputation by popular fiction. Zhuge Liang, as noted above, was an almost unmitigated failure. His "disciple" Jiang Wei was perhaps worse, if only by virtue of launching even more campaigns against Wei. While Xu Shu did recommend Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei, he never served him in any capacity and the battle with the "Eight Gates Formation" in which he supposedly defeated Cao Ren is pure fiction. He also never rose high in Cao Cao's regime not out of refusal to craft stratagems, but just because he wasn't all that good at his job. Pang Tong is almost certainly overhyped, but Liu Bei's Yi campaign ground to a complete halt with his death, so he was evidently skilled. Fa Zheng likewise died on his first proper campaign, after tricking one of Cao Cao's greatest generals into an ambush and killing him.
</li><li> Yuan Shao had several notable advisors. Perhaps the best was Tian Feng. His ignored advise is said to have been astonishingly accurate, though this may be an exaggeration after the fact. Chen Gong was Lu Bu's chief strategist, though not highly skilled. He had achieved only a middling position in Cao Cao's army and was generally regarded as being too slow in formulating his plans.
</li></ul></li><li> Liu Xiu, Emperor Guang Wu and founder of the Eastern Han dynasty. His victory at the Battle of Kunyang was one of the few examples in Chinese history whereby odds were so stacked against one army, and yet the underdog won. His side, with about 20,000 men, prevailed against approximately 420,000 troops of the Xin Dynasty. He was also known for formulating strategies back in court and sending said strategies to his generals out in the field, and the strategies still helped his troops win the day.
</li><li> Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the man who earned his agnomen "Africanus" by beating Hannibal at his own game and turning his own strategy against him. Nuff said. One might call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> this as well.
<ul><li> And, naturally, Hannibal himself. Not only did he take a route <em>no one</em> expected by crossing the Alps and striking Italy from the north end and won numerous battles against Rome, he also took advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a> by deliberately <em>not</em> sacking the lands of the Roman general that was most effective against him — leading his compatriots to suspect that his strategy of containment (rather than engaging Hannibal and losing forces) was a result of his having a secret deal.
</li><li> Also from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Punic Wars</a>, Xanthippus. A Spartan mercenary hired by the Carthaginians due the Romans having invaded Africa in the first war, he arrived right after the army at the defense of Carthage, their strongest force, had been routed and the Carthaginians were desperate enough to give him free reign if the peace talks fell through. During the peace talks he reorganized the Carthaginian army with the Hellenistic model, and when the peace talks <em>did</em> fall through a few months later he led the force he had just retrained to fight the Roman invasion force-and <em>annihilated it</em>. He then went back home for fear of political assassination, but the Carthaginians kept his reforms, allowing them to hold their own in ground warfare against Rome for the rest of the war-and providing Hannibal with the force he needed to come extremely close to breaking Rome.
</li></ul></li><li> The Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, The Lion of the North, revolutionized warfare in the 17th century with both strategy and organization. He instituted permanent units, assigned a fixed chain of command, and established a philosophy of cooperation among all combatants. Instead of independent action by many different parts, the entire Swedish army now united to fight as a single team. Gustavus's use of supply lines and bases and his integration of infantry, cavalry, and artillery enabled him to form the first truly professional army in military history. Among the many people who studied him as a role model to follow militarily were Napoleon, who quite obviously is another example of this trope.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subutai">Subutai,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>'s "dogs of war", used his strategies and skill as a commander to conquer more territory than any other commander in history, even coordinating attacks on Poland and Hungary, within two days of each other, from five hundred miles away. This was centuries before the telegraph.
</li><li> The Duke of Wellington Arthur Wellesley. Fought all but one of his battles (Vitoria) outnumbered, sometimes drastically, yet never lost a battle, defeated Napoleon, retook the entirety of the Peninsula, commanded the Allied armies and even deprived of almost all of his veterans (they had been sent to colonial outposts worldwide or fell into the category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a>) stalemate Napoleon who had many more soldiers, mostly veterans and more artillery. Also, a large portion of the army, the Dutch-Belgian contingent, weren't too keen on fighting the French and left, as well as the Heavy cavalry being stupid (as per usual: they were largely composed of variants on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a>) and mostly getting slaughtered after refusing to retreat after a successful charge. And he still held on for an entire day until Blucher arrived with the Prussian army. And he often had to deal with his political opponents in both Spain and London. A complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>.
</li><li> It's not a coincidence that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> had an age named after him, the man fought and won most of his wars against all of Europe.
<ul><li> Even better: as detailed in the <em>Eroica</em> entry, Napoleon's first claim to fame saw him having been kicked out of the army (even if not for political reasons but for refusing to serve as infantry general when he was from artillery) and being recalled into service because he was already known as capable and the Convention had nobody competent around.

The purpose of these three wars? To bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies">the various scattered Germanic states</a> together into a unified nation.
<ul><li> Speaking of Prussia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> probably is this as well.
</li><li> However, when the actual shooting wars started, that's where Bismarck needed his own strategist, General Helmut von Moltke the Elder. He was a commander who had a flair for developing war strategies that could seemingly defeat anyone, especially with that talent guided by the useful axiom he liked to follow when it is time to improvise, "Strategy is a series of expedients," or as is more popular known, "No plan survives contact with the enemy." Unfortunately, that general was among those pushed for aggressive conquests like France's Alsace-Lorraine region after the victory of the Franco-Prussian War, even when Bismarck suspected doing that would be a source for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">more trouble with France in the future</a>.
</li><li> And Carl Von Clausewitz, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">On War</a></em>. His first claim to fame was to study Napoleon's strategies and tactics (that he had experienced on himself, having fought Napoleon at Jena and being captured when the Prussian army was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">annihilated</a>) and use them to reform the Prussian Army and put in theory what Napoleon had improvised. His second claim to fame, detailed in the <em>Eroica</em> entry, was the Trachenberg Plan, the strategy he created with Austrian general Radetzky that led to Napoleon's armies being sufficiently weakened in numbers, firepower and morale to be utterly crushed at Leipzing. Other claims of fame came from the battle of Wavre, where he <em>ridiculed</em> Napoleon's general Grouchy by keeping him busy and away from the battle of Waterloo (where Grouchy's men would have been decisive), and <em>On War</em>, that, while incomplete, is pretty much <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">Big Book of War</a> of Europe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">Erich von Manstein</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>'s best strategist, devising the Fall of France and numerous battles on the Eastern Front.
</li></ul></li><li> Admiral Fyodor Ushakov was one of the best fleet commanders in the Russian Imperial Navy. How good was he? He never lost a battle or a ship in his entire naval career, despite frequently facing the Turks who had superior numbers and firepower. Lord Nelson used some of his tactics to win the Battle of Trafalgar. Not that Nelson would admit it, had he survived. In fact, Nelson was so intimidated by Ushakov, he earlier got him sent to Egypt instead of having Ushakov direct the siege of Malta as the more senior admiral. Unfortunately, the new Tsar didn't appreciate Ushakov's skill and had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a>.

Well, do you remember the Trachenberg Plan detailed in Clausewitz's entry above? Well, <em>he</em> was the mind behind it, Clausewitz was <em>working for him</em>. Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">in his seventies</a>, he was the Austrian commander-in-chief in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence">First War of Italian Independence</a>, and, outnumbered, outgunned and deprived of his forward base at Milan by the city's rebellion, he outmanoeuvred the Sardinian-led coalition until it dissolved under its political difficulties, at which point he fought decisively and won.
</li><li> Giuseppe Garibaldi. If someone was fighting for freedom, he was there. His greatest claim to fame is the <em>Spedizione dei Mille</em> (Expedition of the Thousand), that is <em>conquering a kingdom with a thousand men and a strategy that had previously failed miserably against the same enemy</em>:
<ul><li> the strategy was to land in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and cause a pro-Italian Unification insurrection, as tried by Carlo Pisacane a few years earlier resulting in <em>the people lynching the patriots instead of rising in rebellion</em>. Pisacane, who was barely known had landed near the capital of Naples, where the government was relatively well-liked, and had been stupid enough to free some convicts to increase his group's numbers. Garibaldi instead landed in Sicily proper, where the people hated the government, and, being Garibaldi, those who were about to attack the mysterious men anyway waited long enough for him to explain why he was there, at which point they rose in rebellion <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce">because Garibaldi asked them</a></em>. After which Garibaldi's small army waltzed around Sicily, increasing their numbers through Sicilian volunteers and <em>defections from the government's army</em>, conquered it, and landed on the mainland, continuing to defeat the government armies and increase his numbers through defections. The last battle was between the last twenty thousands demoralized men of the Two Sicilian army and Garibaldi's force of <em>thirty thousands</em>...

During the Japanese invasions of Korea, it was <em>solely</em> thanks to Sun-sin's mastery on the waters that the kingdom was saved, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">political</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">infighting</a> including a Japanese plot that saw him tortured and reduced to the ranks. After his replacement fell into the same trap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IToldYouSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IToldYouSo">that Yi had been demoted for NOT falling into</a>, the Korean court hastily reinstated Yi Sun-sin and, despite his fleet being reduced to only 12-13 ships, he took on a Japanese fleet of 300 ships and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CurbStompBattle/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CurbStompBattle/RealLife">smashed</a></em> it <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Myeongnyang">by picking his battleground carefully<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1f1ic');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1f1ic" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1f1ic');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Strait of Myeongnyang was known <em>locally</em> for having a current that shifted every few hours, which negated the Japanese numbers advantage and sent them into disarray when the current shifted, causing their ships to splinter against each other</span>. When the Japanese attempted to retreat from Korea, Yi met them in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Noryang">one final battle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, his fleet now around 150 ships (thanks to Chinese reinforcements) but now facing <strong>500</strong> Japanese ships. This time, he <em>annihilated</em> them. Ironically, much like Admiral Nelson later would at Trafalgar, he fell in the battle when he was mortally wounded by a stray bullet, dying in his finest hour. In his career fighting the Japanese over the course of the 7-year war, he fought 23 battles and lost <strong>none</strong> (comparably, Nelson only fought 13 recognised battles in his 35 years of service and only 8 were decisive victories). He is still regarded as Korea's greatest hero to this day. The reason it's only a two-man contest?
