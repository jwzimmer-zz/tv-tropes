How? By helping the viewer realize that the "survivors" at the end of a work don't have a future.

The subversion of this trope is if the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">fully realize the effects of their actions</a>... and choose to follow through anyway. Maybe they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">amoral sociopaths</a> who do not care, maybe the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">Omniscient Morality License</a> makes it such that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">the ultimate consequences will be preferable to the status quo</a>, or maybe things are beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> and so anything goes.
</p><p>Some common examples of this trope coming into effect include:
</p><ul><li> Any work with anthropomorphic animals, short of tortoises and parrots (unless it assumes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanlikeAnimalAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanlikeAnimalAging">Humanlike Animal Aging</a>) will most likely have the cast be dead inside of 20 years unless it specifically addresses the issue (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlottesWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlottesWeb">Charlotte's Web</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe">Babe</a></em>). Also, any talking-animal story that takes place on a farm, and one of the characters is a pig — because unlike horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, you only raise a pig for one thing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1p6gh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1p6gh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1p6gh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, there are truffle hogs, but those are rare. In addition, you've got to have boars to sire piglets with sows, but they don't live forever, for obvious reasons. Some prize pigs are more valuable alive than dead (which is why Charlotte saves Wilbur from slaughter in the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlottesWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlottesWeb">Charlotte's Web</a></em> by getting him entered in a county fair), but of course not all pigs are prize material.</span>

</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot">Adam and Eve Plot</a>. Unless there are revealed to be survivors elsewhere, the lack of genetic diversity will mean humanity is doomed in a handful of generations, or at least on track to suffering a particularly depressing genetic bottleneck which will keep subsequent generations in small, unwell populations.
</li><li> Even those collapse-of-civilization scenarios that harp upon mass famine, plague, and mayhem will seldom think to mention the grim prospects for people with chronic medical needs — cardiac patients, diabetics, transplant recipients — who'd be doomed to succumb to their ailments as their medication runs out.
</li><li> Stories in which the heroes defeat an antagonist from a different country with their own army often ignore the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">stopping a single person from achieving their goals never puts down the prospect that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains">someone will replace them</a>. Perhaps the people of the antagonist's nation, united in defeat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelAntagonist">will rise up and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">take the fight to the heroes</a>.

If the protagonist succeeds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableAlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableAlternateUniverse">the implication is that they've wiped out an alternate timeline and every living thing in it,</a> unless said otherwise.

</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that this is an <em>inferred</em> holocaust. If the work explicitly states that there's a horrible aftermath or if it ends on a cliffhanger (for example, depicting an undetected bomb about to explode), then it isn't an example of this trope; you may be looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>. Also note that, despite the name, the "holocaust" doesn't have to involve massive death; it could be as simple as a criminal getting away because the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">didn't give the good guys enough evidence to convict</a>.
</p><p>A possible reason why audiences may see a "happy" ending as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding">Esoteric Happy Ending</a>.

The only survivors are a Proxy, two cogito-infected autoreivs, and a person who is either another Proxy or sterile. However, this is considered good because the small populations of humanity who retreated from the planet a thousand years before begin to return due to the Earth finally recovering from the nuclear winter. Every character we knew that even survived will likely be slaughtered because none of them were meant to survive — Proxies were genetically altered to have a deathly reaction to UV rays and autoreivs were meant to destroy all the sterile humans and then themselves by way of the cogito virus.

Then we zoom out to show the Earth which looks not a little battered, as well as completely reshaped, by the earlier destruction. Clearly, the world will never be the same now.

Anything they get involved with has a 50% chance of causing mass collateral damage, and it's probably not healthy to dwell on the numbers of deaths that can (indirectly or directly) be laid at Kei and Yuri's feet.

Even if the water seeps into the groundwater or evaporates, leaving the land water-rich but not a sea anymore, well, there's still that <em>utter and complete destruction of everything</em> to contend with. A possible explanation is that She only released the water to the south since it's shown at the end of episode one (when the camera pans back while Shu's hanging from the fortress) that everything south of Hellywood is already gone.
<ul><li> And then there's the rather obvious fact that the Sun's expansion isn't going to stop, and that Earth has only a few centuries of life left at best before it becomes an uninhabitable hellhole (and the knowledge and resources needed to leave and restart elsewhere are likely no longer extant).

The short term result is the absence of a dictatorial tyrant; the <em>ugly</em> civil war created by the power-vacuum in his sudden absence (He probably <em>kept</em> hundreds of warlords from starting their own private wars) would kill <em>billions</em> if not <strong>trillions</strong> of innocent, decent alien lives. The lead-up manga for <em>Resurrection of F</em> reveals that years after his death, Freeza's Planet Trade Organization is spread thin enough that it can't spare reinforcements to put down rebellions.

The fact that the resurrection also specifically excluded evil people raises the question of how many of those people were, say, parents or driving cars (and what exactly defines an evil person, anyway). Although, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> scene, so it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a> anyway because those aliens were never killed in the manga or even existed there.

A lot of those were people living on islands that Cell destroyed. Unless the wish meant those islands were remade too, they likely drowned long before making land.

The Macross and the few Zentradi turncoats were able to beat the Boddol Zer fleet. However, Exsedol reminds Britai that there are over 1,000 fleets of the Boddol Zer and Lap Lamiz classes in the galaxy, each one numbering in the millions of ships. What is not stated is that, the power of culture notwithstanding, it would still be a long, hard, and impossibly uphill battle of attrition against possibly <em>billions</em> of ships.

The death toll is not shown but is likely enormous.
</li><li> As the producers apparently hated the Tirolian race the Robotech Masters belong to, the aborted <em>Robotech II: The Sentinels</em> show the Regent's Invid conquering Tirol, herding the population into shelters, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Tesla</a> goes to a shelter, interrogates the prisoners about the Flower of Life and leaves a bomb once he's finished.

It's said that the world adapted, and that this was always going to happen... for Japan, anyway. But it glances over how this affects the rest of the world and even glances over how this affects the things <em>the movie itself</em> brings up — those with breathing conditions like asthma, and how the weather can affect mood and rain generally makes one more depressed. While we see some sunlight in the ending, rain clouds usually block the sun, so everyone must be pretty deficient in Vitamin D, since sunlight is the main source of it. The the effects on the world's ecology isn't touched on, but most animals aren't going to be fine with constant rain. Then there's agriculture probably being fucked, since most land used to farm would be below water level or be getting there, and all crops without shelter would be overwatered. Among lots and lots of other things. The movie glances over <em>all of this</em> with "the world adapted".

</li><li> Although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> is ostensibly a hero, many of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> rampages have caused enormous and widespread destruction, which raises the question of exactly how many innocents have lost their lives as collateral damage. As it stands, only a single Hulk rampage (Incredible Hulk #300, which in Hulk's defense, was the result of Hulk being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raped</a> by Nightmare, and all of Earth's heroes knew this) led to deaths (the number varies but as of <em>Civil War</em>, the count is 26 dead men and women and one dog). Lampshading this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmadeusCho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmadeusCho">Amadeus Cho</a> hypothesizing that the lack of carnage in every other Hulk rampage save the one from Hulk #300 is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">underneath it all, the Hulk still retains Banner's super-math skills, maybe even to a greater degree than Banner, and so he's able to predict the trajectory of all the debris he sends flying and make sure it never hits anybody (Cho himself has a similar ability to instantly calculate trajectories)</a>. Even so, the Hulk's rampages still ruin people's lives, as shown by Jackie McGee's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk">Immortal Hulk</a></em> - her father worked himself to death trying to rebuild their lives after the Hulk destroyed their neighborhood. How many more like Jackie's father the Hulk's left in his wake is unknown, and probably unknowable.

Though the JLA was actually in the process of helping to rebuild the country at the end of that story; it's the reason that Plastic Man hadn't seen his son in months.
</li><li> Done deliberately in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>; it's pointed out early on that the price of freedom in the comic's post-apocalyptic world could very well be starvation. It was a non-issue in the movie because there never was a nuclear war, just a breakdown of several major world governments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> admitted that was a significant plot-hole as humanity would have never been able to survive a nuclear war such as the one in the graphic novel.

Humanity may or may not survive, but it seems to have utterly escaped the author that innumerable ecosystems would be devastated due to the sudden removal of pollinators, prey, and apex predators (mammals in general are not as essential to ecosystems as, for example, many insect species, so they wouldn't be outright destroyed). It is unsurprising that this was remarked midway through the series when geneticist Dr. Mann remarks that with no males, all mammal species would eventually become extinct. However, later on, he implies that this may not be the case when a couple of women see rats long after they were supposed to have all died. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> shows Paris sixty years later, so clearly there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">No Endor Holocaust</a>.

While it's understandable that DC would want to simplify its continuity, this raises some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>. For one, when Flash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> made all the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a>, it <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">erased a ton of characters from history</a></strong></em>. Given the obvious implications, fault for the incorrect "fixing" was later placed on the inteference of Dr. Manhattan.

Even with Tristan picking it up and launching it into the air, and Karolina and Xavin combining their energies to create a massive forcefield, it's still implied that lots of people died, and the brutal gang-war between the Upward Path and the Sinners that was raging at the time probably didn't help things...
</li><li> When one thinks about it, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> has a similar problem as <em>Blue Gender</em>.

Given that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982">movie</a> made it very clear humanity would be doomed if the Thing got to a populated area then, in spite of the destruction of the Things who had taken human forms in the comics, probably a <em>lot</em> of the wildlife has been assimilated and it won't be long before they've spread all over the planet.

During the previews, audience members expressed depression at the end of the film; they'd left with the impression that humanity was screwed on returning to the polluted Earth. The animators added on a series of images to the credits that showed the human race repairing the ecological damage and regaining the skills they'd lost aboard the <em>Axiom</em>, ending with a beautiful landscape. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hundreds of years later, the plant that WALLE found has become a gigantic tree</span>).
</li><li> The ending of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> is optimistic and hopeful for a peaceful future... until you remember how the battle for land and freedom between the Native American people and European settlers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">really turned out</a>. Or how badly the natives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">reacted</a> to common diseases that the European settlers had long since been immune (or at least resistant) to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrinceOfEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrinceOfEgypt">The Prince of Egypt</a></em> (based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a>) depicts Moses after his exile being welcomed and accepted by Midianites and even marrying one (indeed, the Bible states that Moses' first wife was a Midianite), however those who have read Numbers 31:17-18 will know of the massacre of Midianites perpetrated by the Hebrews and commanded by none other than Moses himself. Even funnier is that the movie ends with Moses descending from Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments; presumably the movie cuts out <em>just</em> before he reacts to that whole Golden Calf thing. Then again, it could very likely be the <em>second</em> tablet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></em> invoked this trope twice. First was at the beginning of the movie, where Batman was trying to stop the Jokerz from making off with advanced equipment. One of the pods smashed into a building causing an explosion, as well as another one with the equipment itself exploding. Realistically, people would have been killed by the explosion. The second is near the end of the movie, where Joker was using his hacked into defense satellite "toy's" laser to gun down Batman and kill anyone nearby, even demolishing a theater that was implied to be full of people (in the uncut version, the edited version made the building abandoned), and later activated it (albeit accidentally) to have it target his own lair. Realistically, people would have died even before Batman managed to stop him once and for all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BebesKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BebesKids">Bébé's Kids</a></em> ends with the baby causing a massive power outage across Las Vegas by pulling apart a giant cable on the ground. In the ending, the kids go back home to <em>BeBe</em>, who lives in the ghetto, who is at the very least an absentee parent. Leon has a shot, since he's not actually one of the kids, seems to be pretty decent, and his mother seems to give a damn about him but, seriously, everybody else is headed to juvie, if they're lucky. No parents, poor schooling, terrible diet, living in a bad neighborhood? Not exactly a recipe for success.

What happens if the <em>nuke</em> that exploded in his face ended up doing the opposite?

<ul><li> Since he's shown smiling while reassembling, it can be assumed the Iron Giant is still his happy-go-lucky self, and if others of his kind were to show up, he'd fight tooth-and-nail to defend Earth. The big issue at play is the fact that the nuke exploded in the upper atmosphere, and yet nothing is said about electronics being fried by the inevitable EMP burst such an explosion would create (theoretically, of course).

It was already assumed that most of the villagers died as a result, but when you consider that this event was thought to have wiped out the entire panda species, it makes you wonder just how big the death toll really was...

The ship turns to gold and sinks, and because the Vanishing Isle had submerged and would not rise until long after and there's no other land nearby, they must have drowned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLorax">The Lorax</a></em>, a forest ecosystem is destroyed and the animals in it displaced, but it's very unlikely that all of them survived, and indeed, we never find out what happened to them.

All of the giant food that has fallen all over the world will most likely make the words "famine" and "starvation" archaic. As long as the food doesn't start rotting, of course, though the world's governments would probably move very, very quickly to preserve the sudden influx of food reserves. If it could be preserved and not rot (preferably underground), this could also potentially lessen the after-effects of nuclear war, as there would be enough food to stave off starvation...provided no one uses ground-bursts or bunker-busting weaponry, but even then, the food would probably be stored deep enough that no nuclear attack could touch it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MulanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MulanII">Mulan II</a></em> is pretty infamous for this trope: The main plot is that Mulan and company are moving three princesses to a neighboring kingdom as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> to the other kingdom's prince. However, the three princesses and Mulan's old friends Ling, Yao, and Chein Po wind up falling for each other, so Mulan helps the princesses to follow their hearts and get out of the arranged marriage so they be with the ones they truly love. Happily ever after, right? Well...the thing is, the reason the princesses were in this arranged marriage in the first place was so both their home kingdom and the other kingdom could be united to repel an invasion by the Huns. Mushu's deception causes the other kingdom to make the alliance, but it's unlikely it will last without the marriage to hold things together.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Minions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Minions">Minions</a></em> depicts the titular creatures teaming up throughout history with various evil historical figures, including Genghis Khan and Napoleon.

The fact that they go into hiding during World War II also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">implies that</a> the reason Minions didn't assist in the Holocaust was that they didn't get the opportunity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/NextGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/NextGen">Next Gen</a></em> has the villain's goal being to "put a Q-6 in every home" and he started by giving out free Q-6s to everyone who had attended his show. When Mai exposes the fact that the robots are actually remote-detonated bombs that he wants to use to kill the human race before he could get them sold worldwide, he starts detonating them all then and there out of pure spite. Given how unlikely it is that everyone in the city would be present at or watching that particular soccer game to get the warning they would explode, Ares' plan likely still killed <em>thousands</em>. That's to say nothing of the fight the villain then has with 7723 afterwards, with cuts a swathe through the city.

Although the heroes are able to spread an airborne cure across the city and revert everyone who was a zombie back to normal, the chaos of the initial outbreak went on long enough that thousands would have died. That's not even getting into the emotional trauma the people who'd become zombies must be going through now that they're cured. Even if one assumes they won't remember anything they did while infected, many of them likely came to their senses over the corpse of a friend or loved one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">with the taste of flesh in their mouth.</a>

How people survived the movie at all is a miracle in and of itself, several weeks without food or running water for at least the majority of the populace (in the novel, the female lead is the ONLY person to retain their sight). There are... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">surprisingly few corpses</a>, considering how food production must have stopped entirely.
</li><li> A smaller-scale example that draws upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>; the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights">Boogie Nights</a></em>, which chronicles the changing fortunes of a porn star based on John Holmes through the 1970s and 1980s, ends at some point in the early 1980s with the characters reunited and getting back to work. It seems like a happy ending, but this trope kicks in when you realize that it ends just before the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS crisis which, among other things, ravaged the porn industry as numerous performers were infected due to unsafe sex practices. Among them was John Holmes, who the main character is based on.
</li><li> The 1935 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn">Errol Flynn</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainBlood">Captain Blood</a></em> ends with Flynn's character appointed the new governor of the English colony on Jamaica, based out Port Royal, by the new king, William III. The revolution that brought William to the throne took place in 1688. Port Royal was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Royal#Earthquake_of_1692_and_its_aftermath">completely destroyed by an earthquake<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1692.

Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentCredits">Silent Credits</a>.
</li><li> Although not a "Holocaust" exactly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir">Con Air</a></em>, Garland Greene manages to survive the events of the film, and is last seen happily engaged in casino gaming. As we all know, demented, crazed serial killers, <em>don't just "get better".</em> Had the movie run just a bit longer, we might have gotten to see him convert Casino patrons into headgear.
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CountYorga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CountYorga">Count Yorga</a></em> and <em>Return of Count Yorga</em>, despite the title character being killed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">No Ontological Inertia</a> is <em>not</em> in effect. Meaning the people he turned are still vampires, no longer have their morality and will continue to feed, kill and spread the undead curse. Considering that all the protagonists are either dead or are turned into vampires by the film's end, it's largely implied those turned will continued to do so with no one to oppose them. Especially jarring in the second film when you consider it takes place next to an <em>orphanage</em> and, outside of Yorga, not <em>one</em> vampire was staked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, Gordon says that "the Narrows is lost". That's an entire section of the city, albeit isolated from the rest of Gotham, consumed by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, including most of Gotham's available police force. The path the train took before it crashed probably wasn't too pretty either while Fox was mixing up a cure. Somehow, though, Batman and the remaining police apparently brought things back from the brink in time for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>.
</li><li> Parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>'s viral marketing campaign focused on the aftermath of the city being exposed to the toxin in <em>Begins</em>. The results was a sudden increase of mental illness in the city because of the contaminated drinking water; this could explain why Gotham's got so many madmen for the Joker to recruit, and why Arkham's got a revolving door. But there's no indicator that the people infected by the toxin were permanently damaged by the toxin; Rachel was a special case, as she was given a "concentrated dose" as said by Scarecrow. Odds are, most of the people infected by the fear toxin were able to recover after a time when the water vaporizer was destroyed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> a city of 12 million people is taken hostage and cut off from the rest of the world. While food supplies are being brought in on the one remaining bridge, the logistics of fairly distributing them to a terrified populace without a police force almost certainly means rioting, anarchy, and mass starvation. It puts the eerily empty streets in a new light. During the climax, Batman <em>destroys a skyscraper</em> that's in his way, and during the battle a lot of other buildings are hit with explosives. Either it was an act of major desperation, or he felt confident no one was alive inside. Either way, that's a lot of deaths.

<ul><li> An entire hemisphere is now buried under ice and snow, which is very concerning when you remember it happens to be the hemisphere with the majority of Earth's farmland. But that's probably of minor concern when you consider that all this extra snow is going to lower the Earth's albedo: the amount of sunlight that is reflected back into space. Once ice or snow fields pass under 20 degrees latitude, you reach a critical point where so much sunlight is being reflected Earth starts becoming even colder due to lack of heat, which obviously leads to more snow, even lower albedo, eventually resulting in the whole planet freezing into a giant snowball. Guess around which latitude the Mexican border (the first patch of land not covered with ice) is. Even if that won't turn Earth into a snowball, it will destroy most life on it thanks to huge climactic changes.
</li><li> In the real world, it is likely the remaining American citizens and soldiers may face violence and/or persecution in Mexico given the resource issues and the sheer flood of refugees (and soldiers who could be seen as invaders) - and the fact that the United States is now near-powerless. The film tries to hand-wave this by saying the US President had forgiven Latin American debt in return for accepting refugees: surely the present global economic system would collapse with North America, Europe and Russia uninhabitable, and how can debts be owed to a country that no longer exists?
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008">The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)</a></em> Klaatu sacrifices his physical form to stop the Gort nanobot cloud... by unleashing a massive EMP like pulse that covers the entire Earth. The last few minutes of the movie show <em>entire cities</em> shutting down... and the movie ends. Now, there are two ways to interpret this: the pulse shut down all electronics temporarily (maybe even shutting down all mechanical devices as shown by how Helen's simple mechanical watch no longer works after the blast), which would cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people (such as airplane passengers, people dependent on life support, people with pacemakers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp">people undergoing open surgery</a>...) or it shut down all electronics on Earth <em>permanently</em> which would not only cause the <em>aforementioned</em> deaths but eventually lead to the further deaths of <em>millions</em> due to lack of heating, food spoilage, and the inevitable global mayhem. Nuclear power plants would go into meltdown, chemical plants would spit toxic compounds into rivers and the atmosphere, many millions would die without access to modern medicine... the list goes on and on. The implications and the actual effect of such an event are simply ignored due to the movie's abrupt end. The lack of global communications also means that those who knew what happened and why would be unable to warn everyone else why they needed to change. Thus creating the very likely possibility that Klaatu will come back and think the players 'squandered' their second chance (when the warning was actually lost) and kill them all.

The author of this article suggests that should humanity gain access to steam power, thus giving them the ability to construct working steam engines and turbines, some semblance of normalcy may be regained, but it's still on an irradiated and severely damaged version of how life used to be. Electricity may even be possible if Faraday cages are used. Any subsequent alien visits would find a slowly recovering Earth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">populated by a still-surviving and vengeful human race</a>, hiding their shielded weaponry beneath irradiated tracts of ground and sea, waiting for the opportunity to get their revenge at a race that took everything from them.

It's not perfect, though. Hope you didn't crash when your car shut down while driving the freeway, because you can't find a functioning phone to call 911 and the ambulances aren't working anyway.

Given the kind of technology they have, the human race will not only be facing a possible alien invasion but also suffer a similar fate, or something much worse than what they put the captive Prawns through.

(The novelization, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">which gives a lot more background and character detail</a>, subverts this neatly: said tape in question is what the slimeball US President is hoping to use as an ace in the hole to force the Soviet Union and China into doing what <em>he</em> wants. Plissken's destruction of the tape isn't going to cause another war: it's just going to ensure that the balance of power remains unchanged and business carries on as usual.)

This is the final step in his metamorphosis from a sad, shy hypochondriac to an assertive, confident adult. But the facts remain thus: the Ferrari is beyond saving, and the elder Frye, who prioritizes his material wealth, <em>especially the Ferrari,</em> to the exclusion of everything and everyone else, will be home shortly. If Cameron pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> was as deathly afraid of his father as he said he was, one can safely infer that his father has given him <em>damn good reason</em> to be.

Suffice it to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel">many fanfics</a> have been written depicting this scene, with varying outcomes.

The novelization stated that time moved differently on Earth and Mongo, so while Ming has been playing with Earth only quite recently, the effects had been happening for several years. This also implied that the Moon would still be safely away from Earth to maintain a stable orbit once Flash wins.

Even if that doesn't happen, the fact remains that Russia has inadvertently destroyed every single satellite and space station in orbit, killing at least four people, which will have all kinds of nasty political fallout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a></em> has the fairies forced underground by humanity's expansion into their rightful territory. With the entire royal family dead and the Golden Army unusable, their civilisation will most likely be split by rival claimants to the throne, and the BPRD has lost its heroic members, so there's nothing standing in humanity's way to continue expanding, driving the fairies to extinction. This is without taking into account that in the films, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a>, to the point that when the forest god dies it creates a forest compared in the novelisation to Eden - which humans then pollute and destroy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend">I Am Legend</a></em>, a cure is found and delivered to a walled city housing some survivors. But considering the infectees' physical capabilities, how is that city wall going to stop them? And what good will the cure be if it requires that the infectees be captured alive, restrained, and packed in ice while it's administered? The opening narration says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> killed 90% of humanity, with almost every survivor instead becoming a Dark Seeker (only 12 million of 600 million not killed by the virus were straight up immune). "Curing" them is logistically impossible. Also, what's the point? It's hard to imagine the surviving pockets of humanity wanting to mount a planet-wide kidnapping war just to end up with half a billion bed-ridden invalids. After years of being monsters, what kind of lives can the cured have? The original (alternate?) ending would've implied all that; there the Dayseekers weren't mindless creatures but trying to rescue one of their own. Even with a cure, sheer numbers would've forced a coexistence, at best. According to the director's cut advertising, this was a controversial idea. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16258_5-awesome-movies-ruined-by-last-minute-changes.html">This article addresses it pretty clearly.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyThwartedAlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyThwartedAlienInvasion">unmitigated and total victory over the aliens</a> is wonderfully uplifting, until you realize that the aliens blew up all the major nations' capitals and several dozen of its primary cities in the days they went unopposed. Did we mention that, thanks to industrialization, around 90% of the developed world's population now live in cities? Also, the effects of a ship 1/4 the size of the moon blowing up (due to a <em>nuclear explosion</em>, no less) cannot be good. Especially not if the <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060728101642/http://intuitor.com/moviephysics/independ.html">theory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the alien weapons were powered by antimatter is correct.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar">Interstellar</a></em>, due to the crop failures and massive dust storms, it's not hard to imagine that a good percentage of the human population had starved to death by the time the film starts. With <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the multiple ships en route to Saturn in the finale</span>, there might have only been a few million people left. Them seemingly all being American ties logically to corn being the last of the big 5 staple crops to die out. Corn is not one of the higher ones. Rice and wheat sustain the vast majority of the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IpMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IpMan">Ip Man</a></em> concludes the final fight with the speculators overpowering the Japanese guards to get to the wounded hero, then cuts to him being taken to safety and later to his real-life success. What happens to the Foshan townsfolk as a result of the most probable Japanese response is left unknown. The sequel shows the Japanese taking out their anger on one of Ip's allies, but the fate of the rest remains unknown.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> Pottersville has more excitement and a superior economic infrastructure. Bedford Falls only has a moderate manufacturing economy and no obvious places to find excitement. Once the factory closes down, Bedford Falls will suffer depression and unemployment. Pottersville has backup industries, such as the nightclubs, that can encourage outside investment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>: The Council had already said so many Judges were murdered that even if they promoted cadets they wouldn't have enough to enforce laws effectively in the city, with the threat of city-wide disorder otherwise. It was this fear that convinced them to unlock the Janus files and clone new Judges rapidly. However, during the climactic fight the clone lab is destroyed, so presumably the technology is not available (at least right away). Yet the film ends with the impression everything's fine. Given the above and what they said, even Dredd may be hard-pressed to control the devastating riots that could wrack Mega City One in the coming months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">main characters get away unscathed</a>, but there were countless people injured or killed by the dinosaurs. Claire and InGen are going to face <em>years</em> of litigation for that. Their company will collapse since no one will want to see another dinosaur theme park. <em>Ever</em>. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorldFallenKingdom">the sequel</a> explicitly states that the disaster resulted in the ruin of both companies.
</li><li> Military-history experts agree that none of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KellysHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KellysHeroes">Kelly's Heroes</a></em> would have had much chance to spend any of the gold they stole. Kelly's group would have been shot at and/or arrested when they tried to move back across the American lines in a German truck, and Oddball's crew would've almost certainly gotten killed, leaving the scene in a defective Tiger while the General's forces are securing the area. Though given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">the era that the film was made</a> it's a safe surmise that they deserted at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerKlownsFromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerKlownsFromOuterSpace">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a></em>: It's never spelled out just how many people were killed by the Klowns, but they were scooping people up all over town (to the point that they needed a giant vacuum cleaner for the job) and there were a <em>lot</em> of cotton candy cocoons in the tent ship. The number's probably in the hundreds. The movie ends on a lighthearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PieInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PieInTheFace">Pie in the Face</a> gag however.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>, Valentine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">Hate Plague</a> signal was in full effect (with a brief interruption) for about five minutes. It stands to reason that <em>several millions</em> of people, all over the world, would have killed each other by then. Valentine may not have reached his full goal, but he probably came a long way. It's hard to imagine how the Kingsman could ever hope to cover up this story. It goes further than that. By the end of the movie, an enormous number of world leaders, military generals, and scions of industry are dead, and it would appear nobody knows why. Granted the movie's satire argues they're no great loss, but society would grind to a halt as people worked out and/or started fighting over who was in charge. The rest of the Kingsmen probably had a hell of a mess to clean up. The fact that even people like Dean and his crooks managed to survive suggests that Eggsy, Roxy and Merlin did manage to avert most of the catastrophe. The keyword being <em>most</em>, as very likely the situation is still a terrible one in the aftermath.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard">Live Free or Die Hard</a></em>. Okay, folks, imagine you had basically shut down the country's entire infrastructure, including police and firefighter communications, programmed traffic lights to give contradictory instructions, <em>and</em> done your best to inspire a mass panic by transmitting nationwide a (faked) video of the White House blowing up. Merely shooting the bad guy is not going to clean all this up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em>, all the people are forced to evacuate their city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Crystal Spires and Togas</a>, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Evil AI</a> that ran it is defeated. Despite the evil, it was a beautiful and decadent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">Utopia</a> where no one had wants or needed to know a valuable skill or trade. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">The downside</a> was it killed them at 30. To put it plainly, these humans are entirely dependent on machines to provide and don't even know what the Sun is. The Sun! Saying 90% of the thousands of refugees died in the winter would be optimistic, as they knew nothing about wilderness survival and had only one senile elder human to teach them how to survive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em>:
<ul><li> The battle in Smallville not only involves Supes and the other Kryptonians fighting in a populated town smashing through inhabited buildings with reckless abandon, but the US military fires <em>missiles</em> into the town, yet not a single civilian death is seen or mentioned.
</li><li> The final battle sequence involves General Zod's World Engine destroying a major chunk of Metropolis' core, and the ensuing evacuation shots show pieces of (and entire) buildings collapsing and falling on fleeing members of the populace. Likewise, the final fight between Clark and Zod results in at least one building's structural integrity weakening (due to Zod using his heat vision to incinerate the supporting columns), and a satellite crashing into the city. Yet, in the final scene (where Clark bikes to the Daily Planet), life has seemingly returned to normal and no civilian causalities of any kind are mentioned.
</li><li> The <strong>massive</strong> probable civilian death toll of the climax of <em>Man of Steel</em> in any kind of naturalistic universe led to a full-scale backlash against this trope among both fans and mainstream media film critics, which led to several superhero and SF films of 2015-16 (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond">Star Trek Beyond</a></em>) taking great and unsubtle pains to either avoid it and/or acknowledge it: <em>Civil War</em> has the conflicts with Loki, Hydra, and Ultron lead the United Nations to establish a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a>, while <em>Man of Steel</em>'s sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> used it as partial motivation for both Batman and Lex Luthor (as well as having Supes throw <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doomsday</span> to an abandoned dockyard before fighting him).

Neo wins! All people can be free from the Matrix if they want to leave! Yay!...Oh wait that means billions of people finding out their life is a total lie and they can choose to keep living knowing it's a lie. Or they can go die in a post apocalyptic wasteland. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline">The Matrix Online</a></em> has the Machines not objecting to the pre-existing freeing process - people are still offered the choice of red pill (freedom) or blue pill (this is a dream, nothing's unreal about the life you lead), but humans don't <em>have</em> to. There is simply no more war in the real world, so freed humans who would or previously would have lived in Zion before moving permanently to their hovercraft may choose to work for the Merovingian or the Machines themselves; the insinuation is that the real world is meaningless with the Machines' willingness to kill all the humans now gone, because the humans can't populate the surface, and the Machines still need live humans for the processing power of their brains. In the end, nobody can <em>use</em> the real world, but everyone <em>needs</em> the Matrix to keep running as usual.
</li><li> The fact that the workers and the capitalists reconcile at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> doesn't change the fact that the city is in ruins and all the machines it depended on were destroyed. Sure, Joh Fredersen knows how to build the city, but the man who took care of all the tech details just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">fell off the cathedral roof</a>. Besides, where are all the workers supposed to live after their homes flooded out?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oblivion2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oblivion2013">Oblivion</a></em>: Even with the Tet gone, humanity is screwed. The planet is a wasteland, most of its water is gone. The survivors have no chance of rebuilding civilization again because the planet now lacks the necessary resources for it. Also, the remains of the Moon are still in orbit and will provide a constant source of large-scale impact events that through their sheer number eventually WILL cause a massive extinction of whatever multi-cellular life still lingers on.
</li><li> <em>Of the Dead</em> films:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Dawn of the Dead (1978)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LandOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LandOfTheDead">Land of the Dead</a></em> have the remnants of humanity holed up and later get eaten, save for a handful of survivors. At least in the case of <em>Land of the Dead</em> the zombies were growing smarter, so maybe they'll evolve back to a human intelligence and live happy but smelly lives themselves.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></em> is less explicit in its implication that the remainder of humanity is doomed at the hands and mouths of hordes of zombies, and more implicit that the remainder of humanity will destroy itself due to paranoia and mob rule. At the end of the film, Ben is the only survivor of his group. Upon trying to signal a posse of gun-toting zombie hunters, he's mistaken for a zombie, shot in the head and killed. The posse piles him up with other dead zombies, specifically laying him next to the first zombie seen in the movie. The implication is that this posse will shoot first, ask questions later, a rather hopeless situation for Ben and other surviving humans in his same position. There was also a mention of how the posse kept making their way into places heavily surrounded by zombies in order to find survivors, but never found any. Meaning that no one was able to tell the living from the dead and just kept shooting on sight.

One, people came with their families for the execution and the scene shows the amorous citizens grabbing the closest person to them. Wouldn't this mean many people would end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">screwing their relatives</a>? Second, executions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">back then were publicly open for all ages</a>.

Later on, Will is in a cage made out of bones with the other pirates...
<div class="indent"><strong>Will:</strong> Where's the rest of the crew? <br/><strong>Gibbs:</strong> These cages we're in... were not built until <em>after</em> we got here.

Granted, Jack the Monkey was alive aboard the bottled <em>Pearl</em>, but he's immortal anyway. Cotton's parrot is also seen, which might mean that the rest of the crew is still alive on it. Or that the parrot survived on its own.

Since the aliens are defeated at the end, we must assume that either a) more of the aliens will arrive to complete the destruction of the Earth, or b) humans <em>will</em> develop the solaronite and destroy the universe. Either way we're screwed. Alternatively, that's not so much a research and logic failure as it is Eros not actually having any better understanding of what he's talking about than the movie's writers. Since it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a></em>, the fact that all life in the movie's universe could be destroyed isn't necessarily a bad thing, and many viewers would likely consider it a relief or even a mercy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predators">Predators</a></em> ends with the two surviving main characters killing the final predator as the next 'game' begins. They mention how they're going to try and find another way off the planet they are on. Which is well and good, but if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Crazy Laurence Fishburne</a> is anything to go by, there will be another group of predators for that game, and they have absolutely no intention on letting them get off.

It's worth mentioning that the T-Virus has completely killed all other plant and animal life. So really, humanity is boned with or without the zombies. The last movie implies that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Umbrella Corporation</a> is still active and functional, and could potentially save humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">if they would just pull their head out.</a>

The implications of a <em>thermo</em>-failsafe device obliterating OCP's headquarters (the tallest and largest building in the city) and causing an explosion that engulfed the entire surrounding area are never discussed or elaborated upon. Apparently, the viewer is supposed to be happy that Robo and his friends successfully stopped McDaggett and OCP from bulldozing Old Detroit, while ignoring that at least dozens of OCP employees (and presumably a large chunk of Detroit's downtown core) was just destroyed.
</li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movies</a> portray anyone who doesn't believe in the killer doll, the killer cyborg, or the killer dream ghost as jackasses who deserve to die, but in reality, why would <em>anyone</em>?

Imagine that you just walked into a crime scene with 10 people's entrails all over the floor and a blood-soaked sorority sister holding a butcher knife saying a reanimated corpse did it. Would <em><strong>you</strong></em> take her seriously, and on the off chance that you did, do you think there's a judge, a defense attorney, and 12 other people who would agree with you?

It's probably best that the movie didn't go into what most likely happened to all the <em>Gorgonite</em> toys that were in that truck. Also, at the end of the film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Gil Mars</a> plans to manufacture <em>more</em> of them, add a few zeroes to the price and sell them to <em>the military</em>.

While the idea of revolting against the engineer and his staff is a good thing, it falls apart when the locomotive section is destroyed, causing the entire train to derail and crash. At this juncture, it really doesn't matter that the evil overlord and his henchmen were killed: with the entire world being a frozen wasteland, all of remaining humanity and life were contained on that one train. Two kids surviving the wreckage, in an environment that experienced mountain men have trouble with, doesn't seem inspiring. The sequence at the end, with the polar bear in the distance looking at the kids, was supposed to inspire hope for life.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vka5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vka5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vka5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Alternatively, it could inspire hope for ursine life.</span> Only, polar bears are super predators, and known <em>Man-Eaters</em>.

<ul><li> The destruction of Alderaan must have had some effects on the rest of the galaxy. It was a Core world and implied to be powerful and rich. Surely the complete explosion of an entire world would cause economic collapse on other planets that relied heavily on trade with it. Additionally, even ignoring the economic and political consequences, a planet exploding and leaving chunks of debris scattered around would make the whole solar system uninhabitable and likely destroy any ships nearby.
</li><li> A classic example is the destruction of the Death Star II in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. Some fans claim the effects of a moon-sized ship being blown up in orbit around Endor's moon would have almost annihilated all life on the planet, supported by the Special Edition showing chunks of the Death Star II raining like hailstones. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsTales">Star Wars Tales</a></em> even had a story about this ("Apocalypse Endor", in issue #14, told from the perspective of a former stormtrooper). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">George Lucas stated that it didn't happen,</a> with the result <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">naming a trope</a>.

</li><li> The trope as it applies to the personnel <em>aboard</em> Death Star II is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> at length in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em>, pointing out that since the station was still under construction, there were surely plenty of civilian workers. A construction worker who overhears mentions that this was the very reason he turned down a roofing job for a known mafia boss; his friend who took the job was not so lucky.
</li><li> A canonical example is the Death Star holocaust, i.e. the rank-and-file Imperial troops, contractors, etc. that died when the rebellion blew up the first Death Star. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, the New Republic put the official number of deaths as 500,000, but the real number is more like <em>5 million</em>, and the lowered estimate is pure propaganda.
<ul><li> It's been <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Y3dlTDAxw">theorized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the destruction of the first Death Star was catastrophic on a scale that all previous theories couldn't match - an <em>economic</em> scale. Building it was the most expensive project in recorded history. It carried a massive amount of manpower and combat strength. Its commander, Grand Moff Tarkin, was third in the line of succession behind Palpatine and Vader. <em>Democratic government</em> had been dismantled in favor of literal gunship diplomacy, based around this one military asset. Despite that, life in the galaxy was pretty much "business as usual". It was just another government project, and few people outside the Imperial military even knew it <em>existed</em> - not out of any attempt at secrecy, but general <em>apathy</em>. The Galactic Empire was rolling along smoothly, and most people didn't even <em>care</em> that Alderaan was destroyed, like most didn't think twice about Waco. When it was destroyed, however, it was pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">9/11</a>; massive reductions in private spending, increased sympathy for the government - it drove the galaxy into a recession, and the war against the Rebellion into overdrive. It still worked out damn well for the Rebellion, as it proved that the Empire not only wasn't invincible, but its single most powerful asset couldn't protect itself from "terrorists."
</li></ul></li><li> A smaller example is the Battle of Coruscant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>: That battle wasn't in space, but rather the planet's upper atmosphere. That one Separatist frigate, and other ship in the battle that gets shot down is going <em>down</em>, and given the fact that the planet is one big city, is guaranteed to hit <em>something</em>. For that matter, we actually see the ship the Jedi crash down in knock over buildings; the inevitable death toll is never acknowledged.
<ul><li> The visual guide states that four people died when Anakin crashed onto the runway, but tens of thousands more would have done so if he hadn't. Additionally, the novelization pulls no punches by outright stating that hundreds of thousands of people were dying via collateral damage for every hour that the battle dragged on.

His last appearance consists of him being left behind as Rooster rides off to get Mattie's snake bite treated. But the problem is that just a few moments ago he had suffered a horrible whack over the back of the head with a large rock, bad enough to knock him out cold, and at this point he is visibly bleeding from the mouth and his speech is slightly slurred. That, added with the length of time it takes for Rooster to get help for Mattie (it's night when they reach a doctor) it's entirely possible that LaBoeuf died of his head injuries before Rooster could get back.

<ul><li> Although the book ends on a hopeful note, it's also set up in such a way that one person not being careful enough could start the whole thing over again.

</li><li> If you ignore the catastrophic environmental damage, collapse of many state governments, tension between those that are still around... Humanity has learned to fight off the zombies and many people have overcome their differences to work towards rebuilding, but there's the implication that it may be too little too late, especially considering the Holy Russian Empire's freely admitted ambitions of outbreeding and conquering the west.

When the story ends, that universe collapses and everyone dies except our protagonist, who returns to the "real world". We, however, know that it's just a story, so once the book ends his universe must be destroyed too.

The authors, however, seem to have no idea of how devastating a catastrophe like this would be, and life returns to normal a few days later.

"Only Moties carrying the parasite will be allowed to leave the Mote system." All it takes is one unscrupulous physician to find a way to kill the "Crazy Eddie Worm" without killing the Motie hosts and bingo, the disaster for the entire galaxy envisioned in the first book is now inevitable. Or something else happening to make the parasite no longer viable in Moties. That doesn't even count the Moties that reached the brown dwarf system.

The boy is found by 'the good guys' in what feels like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">forced happy ending</a>, but then you realize that <em>there is no biosphere</em>. <em>Everything is dead</em>.

Even having one productive copper mine makes up for all the rest that were blown up, because those were subject to taxation and therefore worthless. Sure, the heroic capitalists may have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld">Lost World</a> up and running fine, but it is unlikely that their egoistic powers are really enough to save the country from spiralling into mayhem and civil war? Even so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">they weren't necessarily going to save the world from mayhem and civil war</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>; they were waiting until everything was screwed and civilization would have to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Which leads one to wonder, how bad <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">the Blight</a> anyway, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">that was the better option</a>?
<ul><li> For every civilization killed a thousand survived. If the Blight had been allowed to spread unchecked, it would have become the only sentient being in the entirety of the Beyond - a "stable necrosis" as one character put it. It was a cancer spreading through the galaxy, and the only way to kill cancer is to kill a bunch of noncancerous cells as well....the Countermeasure was a focused radiation beam on the grandest scale imaginable, a partition to the <em>entire galaxy</em> to isolate and kill the cancer.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Brigadoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a></em>, the eponymous Scottish village appears on earth for one day every hundred years. This seems fine until you realize that by the time one year has passed for the villagers, <em>36,500 years</em> have passed on Earth! How many years will it be before the land the town inhabits is rolled over by an ice-age glacier, or flooded by the polar ice caps melting, or the Earth becomes uninhabitable in some other way? And this was supposed to keep the townspeople safe!
</li><li> The much-discussed appendix of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a></em> is an inverted example: if no one can topple Ingsoc, it is curious that an in-universe document talks about them in the past tense. On face, this could mean that they imploded under their own weight. However, Orwell once said that the appendix didn't necessarily mean Ingsoc and Oceania fell. There's also the theory that Airstrip One (aka Great Britain) is a North Korea-esque state, and the rest of the world is much the same as our world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMartianChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMartianChronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a></em>, humanity is nearly completely wiped out by a nuclear war, and the last three or so stories in the anthology deal with its aftermath. In them, it is established that the number of survivors could be counted on one hand; of them, only two pairs were couples who later had children. The last story is meant to imply that the two families met up and intermarried, but even then, there is not enough genetic diversity for humanity to continue reproducing. In a few generations, the fertility of everyone will drop to zero due to genetic diseases and the negative effects of inbreeding. It's written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, so this is probably intentional.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a>: Breaking Dawn</em> ends with the Volturi admitting defeat and leaving the Cullens alone and Bella and Edward being left to have a happy marriage for eternity, with no one else wanting to shanghai members of the family or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill their daughter</span>. They all apparently have forgotten that Aro touched Edward's hand during the climax, thus giving him access to <em>all</em> of Edward's thoughts and thus now has knowledge of all of the powers of the gathered vampires, including Bella, who was supposed to be the secret ace-in-the-hole. The book insists that the Volturi would <em>never</em> give up trying to have their way. More generally, there are very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">Vegetarian Vampires</a>. There are probably millions of them in the world, feeding every night.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> By the end of the series, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort</a> is killed, and his clique is scattered or apprehended, the horde of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">depression-inducing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">soul-sucking</a> demons they unleashed upon the world is still around, and never addressed. In addition, Voldemort's racist and genocidal puppet government ran wizarding Britain for almost a year, all the time brutally persecuting muggle-borns and political opponents. It's safe to say the death toll was probably very heavy, and the muggle-borns in particular may have been almost wiped out. Worse, think of how small the Wizarding community is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">and how much intermarriage there's been with "purebloods"</a>. The muggle-borns that diversified the wizarding gene pool are not only probably gone, but anyone <em>outside</em> the wizarding world who knows about the wizards is far less likely to trust them.
</li><li> Considering just how common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potions</a> are in the series and how casually they're treated (to the point of being sold in joke shops to teenagers, and being taught in class), instances of sexual assault and rape under the influence in wizarding society are likely through the roof. There's one confirmed instance of this happening, which even produced the series's main villain, but otherwise, even in the post-series days of <em>Cursed Child</em>, slipping someone a love potion is seen as about on the level of a kick-me sign.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> series, <em>The Last Guardian</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Opal Koboi's past self dies, which causes a paradox when <em>everything she interacted with spontaneously explodes.</em> This includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi">most of our technology</a></span>. Obvious problems, such as planes falling from the sky, are addressed and forgotten about, but this would cause death and destruction on an unimaginable scale, even if they were "small" explosions (not even taking into account all the explosives like <em>nuclear missiles</em>), followed by panic and mass deaths from medical emergencies and starvation, and the collapse of human civilisation as we know it.

Although animal life-spans must be enhanced somewhat, seeing that Reepicheep appears in two books that take place three years apart, and under the best conditions mice only live about two years.

The protagonist not only accepts that he will remain a mouse forever, but he is also extremely optimistic about his short life span, glad that he won't outlive his grandmother. (This only applies to the book though. He gets turned back into a human by the Grand High Witch's assistant at the end of the movie.)

This means that at least twice they've left the original owners of the bodies they took over to die <em>en masse</em> in <em>their</em> abandoned old bodies that they'd suddenly find themselves stuck in with no explanation instead...

Though rarely shown, one can assume that when their employers notice the documents missing these people will be fired and their lives possibly ruined. In a season 3 episode where his own mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls him out on this</a> after she witnessed firsthand what her son has to do every day in order to save lives. Seems to be a B-plot point in Season 4, with several characters (notably Fiona) questioning Michael's adherence to his own principles. An example being an episode in which Fiona tells Michael off for being someone that only cares about the <em>idea</em> of people, but is increasingly disturbingly casual about not caring about actual, specific people he meets and even relies on.
</li><li> In the pilot, Michael heads off a bad guy by hijacking a stranger's car and crashing it into the bad guy's, with no airbags and with the stranger still inside. He walks away afterward and leaves the stranger to deal with the damage and possibly serious injuries. Seriously, was there <em>no</em> other way to protect the kid?

What is essentially a world-wide earthquake would have caused widespread damage, killing thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people, and would be worse than normal given all the damage the Daleks did beforehand. Yet the only thing that Doctor comments on is that the disturbance will lead to a lot of rain. Despite all this, the Earth-pulling is treated as a happy moment. There's also the gravitational disturbances throughout the Solar System and the Moon getting back into place.

This is addressed a few times throughout the show and eventually, the Tok'ra find a way to extract the Go'auld without killing the host, but it is rarely used. However, said humans are usually quite insane after having been a meat puppet for centuries/millennia, and such unnaturally long life often leaves them incapable of surviving without the symbiote anyway. Apophis' host, when captured by the Tau'ri, would have died within days and even begged for death after all the suffering he had been through; chances are, most long-time hosts would feel similarly.
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> concludes with a bunch of innocent children (Ra's servants) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting nuked</span>.

When <em>Deep Space Nine</em> revisited the episode Worf reveals that the tribbles escaped and ecologically devastated several planets. The Klingons eventually completely eradicated the species out of sheer necessity. This leads to another example, as the crew ends up bringing them back at the end of the episode.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode, the Enterprise happens upon a planet in the grips of a pandemic. Another planet produces a cure for them, but Picard discovers that the plague is long gone, but the "cure" is actually a highly-addictive drug. The episode ends with Picard refusing to help the aliens fix their last few functional ships, citing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">the Prime Directive</a> as an excuse. His intention is to resolve the problem by having the aliens discover, after their last few ships break down, that they don't actually need the drug. But how many people in the throes of an excruciating withdrawal period committed suicide because they thought they were dying of plague, and what would happen to the economy and infrastructure of the world as all of its citizens start undergoing detox against their will simultaneously? Likewise, the supplying planet's entire economy was devoted to producing the drug, so they would undergo severe economic collapse as well. When the dust settles from all that, there's the question of how the "plague victim" planet will repay their "benefactors" when they realize the truth. To be fair, Dr. Crusher points out that there will be terrible repercussions for not assisting the aliens, but Picard decides that there is no reasonable way to prevent the eventual catastrophe, and providing repairs for the ships would only delay the inevitable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, the infamous episode "Dear Doctor" where Phlox and Archer commit genocide, by letting the Valakian race die so that the Menk can evolve. Despite Phlox's assertion that the Menk are on the edge of an evolutionary breakthrough, it's only a <em>theory</em> he has (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorBiology">based on an absurd misunderstanding of evolution</a>) and there is no certainty that it will actually occur. Since the Valakians take care of the Menk, it's possible they all starved to death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, the Ocampa are completely reliant on the Caretaker's technology, who gives them 5 years of power for their city, upon realising he's dying. Given how in "Fury", set 5 years later, an older Kes shows up and she's incredibly pissed off, it's likely she returned home only to discover her race either died out or were enslaved by the Kazon.
</li><li> Any episode or movie where time is shown to be mutable. When something goes wrong in the past, the crew usually tries to fix it or make it better, however, that leads to a couple of nagging questions, such as "how do they know they're in the <em>wrong</em> timeline", and "what counts as <em>fixing</em> the past?" Many times, the crew just assumes that the past was fixed and everything is OK because the keys to the Enterprise still work, and Earth is still the capital of the Federation. But despite all the major stuff looking OK, there's a good possibility that hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of people have ceased to exist in the interim, because someone took a second longer to die than they should have, because someone was later or earlier than they should have been, because someone who shouldn't have existed at all was somewhere, preventing something from happening. This just becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> when you look at all of the contradictions in canon and consider they're all explainable as being side effects of missions to change the past that didn't work out as well as the crew thought, and they didn't even know they had failed. Ultimately any time traveling ep becomes a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>, where everything is OK merely because it's OK for the 5 or 6 people with the most screen time.

The book version on the other hand goes on to mention that all the dinosaurs attracted by the food will destroy the local ecosystem by the time the <em>Liopleurodon</em> is gone (we see what riot a single one can cause in the episode), and nothing short of another mega-storm (which would wreck the place even further) could drive the <em>Eustreptospondylus</em> away until then.

The Morthren are in even worse shape, as their population numbers something near 20, and they've had extremely limited success at reproduction on Earth. Better yet, if you factor in the unresolved plot points from the first season, there's an entire Morthren invasion force that's set to arrive at the planet in three years. "Nice morning," indeed.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> supplement "Elder Evils" is basically designed around this concept. Yes, all of the Big Bads can be defeated (or at least can be temporarily driven off), but their appearance irrevocably changes the world. Take Atropus, the World Born Dead, as an example: even if you manage to repel him, his presence has unleashed hordes of undead upon your world and killed off most of the living inhabitants. The awakening of Leviathan, a serpent so large it encircles the planet, has caused earthquakes and tsunamis that have decimated civilization. Yeah, you defeated the monster... but at what cost? Some of them, such as Father Llymic, specifically bring up the resultant epic-scale disaster.
</li><li> Even the best endings in the "Time of Judgement" supplements for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> are usually a little horrifying.

(With all those ancient, powerful, influential vampires ashes in the wind, what happens when, say, the creature that had turned the CEO of Pentex into little more than a hand puppet abruptly vanishes? Still, Wormwood was clear that despite all the rationalizations, Vampires ARE A BAD THING. If nothing else, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> that is the Old World of Darkness, the loss of all Homo Nocturnis is only a benefit.)
</li><li> In just about every other possible ending for the other gamelines humanity is almost wiped out, and much of the planet lies in ruins. Most of the Time of Judgment scenarios for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> ended with societal collapse and significant global body counts.
</li><li> For all the apocalyptic doom and gloom, one of the endings to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> DID imply the end of life as we know it... but only because all of humanity had transcended mortality, awakened as mages, and combined once more into the One and recreated the universe from the beginning.

The diverse cities seen in other games, including their unique cultural development, history, and anything else they might have contributed is either lost or replaced by a barren wasteland filled with Moblins and Octorocks, hermits hiding away in caves, and a small number of remote towns with a handful of people.

One official encyclopedia confirms they're meant to be the same place.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series play with this: the original glosses over all the implied death and destruction caused by Wily's attacks, with <em>7</em> being real bad as the robots that busted Wily out of prison must have killed a number of guards and inmates in the process. The X series averts this, by admitting the heroes are killing sentient robots. <em>X4</em> onward was specific about this, with the heroes telling certain bosses that their actions could cause significant destruction if they didn't stop. <em>X4</em> is especially notable, as the prologue stage has you fighting on a floating city called Sky Lagoon in the first half, and when it falls onto the city below, part two picks up in that decimated city that your character knows was inhabited by millions.
<ul><li> More unusually, by the time of <em>X</em>, nearly all of the characters of the classic series are nowhere to be seen. Doctor Light's absence makes sense (he was an old man, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">he survives as holographic messages anyway</a>), and Wily's implied to have made it somehow, but what about all the robot characters? Were they retired and scrapped? Killed in battle? Left the planet somehow? It certainly doesn't help that X's capsule was discovered in what was apparently the ruins of Doctor Light's lab, now buried a good ways underground — a lab that, in pretty much every canon appearance, is in the middle of a good-sized city.

A clearly-resigned Campbell warns Snake early-on that the absolute best outcome they can hope for is to stop Liquid from taking over the system, and then the plan is to <em>let the Patriots continue to exist</em> so as not to plunge the world into a new dark age. When this fails, they decide to nuke the Patriots anyway because the dark age is simply preferable to Emperor Liquid. Fortunately Sunny is a much better coder than Naomi and finishes the virus so that it only lobotomizes the AIs, leaving basic services untouched. However, as Drebin implies, even with the basic resources being kept intact with the Patriots gone, there is not only still going to be war, but its most likely going to increase as a result due to "not everyone being too happy with rainbows and lollipops". That's not even getting into Drebin's drunken implication that the United Nations will most likely end up becoming the spiritual successor of the Patriots in terms of strict control, or that the entire world is completely broke to the extent that not even creating PMC regulatory laws will get them out of the debt.

The number of deaths that would result from this is obviously quite large (if not exactly earth-destroying) but the interesting point is that this is the most "good" of the Praetorian arcs ...and yet it ends with the largest (inferred) amount of civilian casualties.

Horrible news is, the remnants of the lambent have mutated into something weird and accidentally resurrected the precursor race to the Locust, starting a new war with a weird new enemy. The horrible news is, the lambent pulse affected the very forces of nature, causing hurricanes made of <em>fire</em> that pop up every HOUR. So yes, people are going to die.

The Aeon are still mopping up a civil war and have lost their true leader, what's left of the UEF is struggling to find its feet after the Seraphim tore out its heart and soul (along with almost all of its military personnel), and the always-fractious Cybrans have lost one of the few commanders they could rally around, in addition to their own civil war.

While Gran Pulse itself is not a wasteland, how quickly can a formally city dwelling people learn to live off the land without knowing what is safe to eat while fending off the many monsters than inhabit the surface? However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em> turns it into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">No Endor Holocaust</a>, which is subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> by Vanille, who mentions the thousands of people that died due to her actions, which implies that there <em>were</em> casualties during the fall.
<ul><li> <em>XIII-2</em> also confirms that people died in the fall. One sidequest involves bringing rare flowers to a man to give to his deceased niece.
</li></ul></li><li> There's an interesting example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">novelization</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em>, albeit part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> rather than the main plot. The Cocytans, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, decided to share their technological wonders with the rest of the galaxy, so they sent off a bunch of probes disguised as asteroids. These probes were programmed to "show up" in close proximity to likely planets and (apparently) threaten to crash into them unless the inhabitants of said planet came to take a look, at which point they would be kidnapped and whisked off back to Cocytus to meet the friendly aliens. (Meanwhile, the Cocytans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascended To A Higher Plane Of Existence</a> and got stuck there, leaving rather a cold reception back at home.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> comes in when you ask yourself the question: would the asteroid ships have <em>crashed into</em> the planets they targeted if they didn't happen to have a native society that was sufficiently developed to stop them? This is, perhaps mercifully, left unanswered.
</li><li> All the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games (barring <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>) usually discuss aspects of this trope in each town/person's ending. You killed the rampant raiders? Good now people won't be dragged off and killed. You didn't teach the lowly village about crop rotation? Half the village dies of starvation during a drought later and the rest disbands, scattering into the wasteland.
<ul><li> Particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, with its focus on political warmongering and no clearly "good" side in the conflict. No matter what side you take in the endgame, the other sides will suffer, your side will carry a burden for a long time, and many minor factions will get the short stick no matter what. The Brotherhood will either take up banditry or get blown up in their bunker (unless you have them sign a truce with the NCR, which is only possible if McNamara remains Elder). The Great Khans may evacuate en masse, or they get killed off, go out in a suicide blaze of glory, or assimilated by the Legion. The Followers of the Apocalypse, the brightest and most idealistic in the whole <em>Fallout</em> universe, have <em>one</em> ending where they don't get exterminated, kicked out or saddled with impossible workloads. If you persuade the Remnants and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arcade Gannon</span> to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> and aid the battle while you side with the NCR, guess who ends up arrested as a <em>war criminal</em>? If you are smart and savvy enough you can make sure that almost everyone gets a relatively good ending. To do that however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">you must explore every loop of dialog and every possible story pathway and that can be very time consuming</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> is a fairly nasty example. In a subversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a>, most of the game's areas will have their endings change from whatever was the result of the quests you did there, to being overrun and wiped out by Super Mutants, if you fail to complete the game within a deadline that varies from group to group. Lost a few weeks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> and scrounging for ammo? There goes the Hub... Spend an in-game year or so striving for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, and the victory against the Mutants becomes truly pyrrhic.
</li><li> In <em>The Pitt</em>, no matter which side you take, it is unlikely a cure for the plague will be realized, dooming the residents to slow extinction via mutation.
</li><li> If you infect the water supply with the Modified FEV, it is implied that it will kill everyone on the planet, not just the mutants and corrupt humans in the Wasteland.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> You have to decide between ending multiple crusader factions or nuking a twisted yet enlightened faction. In three of the endings, your actions result in hundreds of idealists dead and Boston controlled by radical extremists of some kind. The only way to avoid this is to side exclusively with the Minutemen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> goes to great lengths to address this. The party realise that they have to permanently deactivate all of the world's Blastia in order to power the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> that will save the world, including the Barrier Blastia that keeps the major centres of population safe. First, they go to the world's leaders and get permission. Then they discuss ways to prepare for the ensuing blackout, such as creating a new military force to guard the cities. The end result is that the world <em>will</em> be harder to live in, but it's not without hope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first game ends with the Hiigaran Exiles defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">saturation-bombed their adopted home planet with thermobaric weapons, killing three hundred million people, for violating a treaty signed by members of their species from four thousand years ago</a> and killing its deranged tyrant, aided and abetted by rebel Imperial Navy units. A player might well wonder what was going to happen to said empire now that its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">God-Emperor of Man</a> expy was dead and buried. According to background material in ambiguously-canon midquel <em>Cataclysm</em>, the answer is "nothing good": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The resulting power vacuum kicked off a civil war that ended with the old Empire messily Balkanised and an awful lot of military hardware in the hands of Imperial loyalists, warlords or pirates. Then the flesh-eating technogenic monster turns up</span>.
</li><li> The game's ending kind of glossed over the question of whether Hiigara had an existing population, and what might have happened to them after the Exiles took possession. The fluff for <em>Cataclysm</em> also establishes that a large percentage of the surviving Hiigarans are <em>very very bitter</em>, and that Hiigara is still very sparsely populated. The <em>best</em>-case scenario is that a whole lot of people got forcibly displaced from their homes for the sake of a much smaller group of refugees, whose actual claim to the planet after a four thousand year absence is frankly somewhat shaky, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6cuv2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6cuv2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6cuv2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Make what you will of the original <em>Homeworld</em> containing a lot of allusions to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Exodus</a></span> and the worst-case scenario is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">a literal Holocaust</a>.

It is convinced not to, but states that it has done its job countless times on other planets before.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, the player character cannot be killed even if the ship they're on is destroyed, but it is made explicit in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.eveonline.com/background/potw/default.asp?cid=14-07-05">supplementary materials<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> supplied by CCP that the ship has a largely-full conventional crew (the player character, a "capsuleer", replaces all command and control crew, but maintenance, etc. is still needed, and on large ships, that's a lot of people). A ship being destroyed is an inconvenience for the player, who in the worst case scenario is transferred to a clone and can start again in a new ship. The rest of his crew (who may number one or two in the smallest of the frigates all the way to tens of thousands in the city sized titans), it's better to just not think about. Then there are the NPC ships you can fight, most of which are not capsuleer-controlled, so even the smallest involve full crews being killed off for (virtual) real.
</li><li> When you think about it, all 4X games, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> end this way, win or lose. Yay! You've won! What's the death toll of your supreme greatness? Bummer, you lost. Not only did your plans suck and got your ass conquered, but you took most of your population down with you in that desperate last stand. Even games which, like <em>Civilization</em>, allow for peaceful victories, it's often necessary to butcher quite a lot of people on the way, especially when your victory is at hand and everyone freaks out and dogpiles you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman">crab bucket-style</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a></em> opens up some horrifying implications about nations with vastly different ideologies conquering each other. Especially in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Purity</a> civs taking over Supremacy or Harmony population centres, as their new rulers are devoted to the philosophy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTranshumanismAllowed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTranshumanismAllowed">they should not exist</a>. Adding to the horror is the threat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">forced augmentation</a>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWouldCutYouUp">forced de-augmentation</a></em> - imagine being pinned to the table and your cybernetic/biological enhancements removed painfully, ending up as a physical or even mental cripple. That's not even getting into psychological damage from lost aspirations, perceived violation of the soul and forced return to mortality; somebody whose lifespan was just shortened from "indefinite barring major incidents" to "a couple hundred years, tops" is bound to have some big existential issues, or see what was done to them as a roundabout way to murder them.
</li><li> The in-game books in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> state that the rock hovering over Vvardenfell is effectively a meteor only held in place by Vivec's power. Without him, it will resume it collision course and cause untold levels of devastation to the island. At the end of the Main Quest, the Heart of Lorkhan, which provided Vivec with his power, is destroyed. According to both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElderScrolls">The Infernal City</a></em> and <em>Skyrim</em>, the island was indeed destroyed and rendered inhospitable. The rest of Morrowind suffered even more once Red Mountain erupted again in the aftermath. <em>And then</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a> took advantage of their longtime enemies' weakness by embarking on a raid across the country.

<ul><li> The main plotline ends with Emperor Martin sacrificing himself in order to stop the Daedric invasion. Unfortunately, this left Tamriel without an Emperor, and with <em>massive</em> casualties in Cyrodiil and beyond courtesy of Mehrunes Dagon's armies. Eventually, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the "inferred" became explicitly stated: the Empire is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">a shadow of its former self</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">the Aldmeri Dominion</a> is the main superpower.

<ul><li> This was one of the biggest problems which caused the uproar of the original ending, in which no matter which choice you made <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mass relays, which made intra-galactic travel possible and were the backbone for the galactic community, are all destroyed</span>; because of this the great majority of players felt that, even barring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the devastating physical effects of such explosions</span>, the galaxy would be plunged into another dark age and that billions of people would be cut off and starve to death.
</li><li> On a smaller scale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Citadel, a giant space station the size of a small country, outright blew up above Earth</span>, which would result in horrendous destruction in addition to the deaths of everyone on it.

On the one hand the horrors suffered by humans due to the years of Combine rule and the various alien species now populating Earth is heavily shown, not the least being the hundreds of corpses Freeman finds (and the less said about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Ravenholm</a>, the better), and the devastation to City 17 and its populace during and after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the destruction of the Citadel</span>.

Because of the purposely ambiguous ending, it's left to the player to decide whether all these people come back to life or not. Of course, this all depends how long after <em>EarthBound</em> <em>MOTHER 3</em> takes place. So we KNOW about the Holocaust, it's just the inferred part is who died because of it.

</li><li> Cave Johnson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">pre-recorded messages</a> in Old Aperture all but explicitly state that a vast majority, if not all, of the test subjects the company recruited over the decades died or suffered horrific injuries or mutations. This means that a whole generation of "astronauts, Olympians, and war heroes" were slaughtered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Science</a>, then a bunch of homeless people, then Aperture's own scientists once they started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig">testing on themselves</a>.
</li><li> Several of the alternate Caves from the Perpetual Testing Initiative implied that many more of this happened in alternate universes, usually involving alternate versions of the pre-recorded messages in the main game, such as Mantis-men overrunning Aperature, a sentient cloud siphoning off people's skins and a space prison escape. Lampshaded with the Sick Boy, who Cave Prime specifically mentioned had died to eliminate any ambiguity on your end. Most of these end up saving Cave Prime's universe by solving his money problem <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and scaring him out of building GLaDOS</span>.
</li><li> The ending has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chell herself</span>. She's free to go anywhere. After having bathed in lots of gel made of moon rock (which is said to be as poisonous as asbestos), breathed in actual asbestos, bathed in the blue gel (which apparently hates the human skeleton and can be absorbed by the skin) and god knows how much trauma from the tests and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being sucked out onto the moon</span>. She probably doesn't stay alive for very long. She's in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> universe, in a world occupied by the Combine, with no weapons, no current allies, and no idea about what might lie beyond.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, where the world was torn apart by war, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> becomes this. Made even worse by the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> actually predicted this and stated this as a reason for continuing his evil plan.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X Universe</a></em> falls to this after the events of <em>X3: Albion Prelude</em>.

Doing so on a small scale in the past has been a good solution to bad problems, but this means not only will the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">younger species</a> be incapable of travelling or communicating with each other or their own colony planets, they won't even know where the other sectors <em>are</em> to <em>try</em> and contact each other for years. Many sectors have nothing but manned manufacturing plants, most of which aren't self-sustaining, and even many planetary sectors rely heavily on trade. On the other hand, it also had the byproduct of stopping the Argon/Terran war in its tracks, which at this rate was going to end in one of the two sides being completely wiped out. The Terrans would come off the best, as a) over two thirds of their sectors are in the Solar System, and they've got non-jumpgate technology for intrasystem travel, and b) they <em>do</em> know where their other main sector is in space, and can reach it using jumpdrives.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantHistoria">Radiant Historia</a></em> ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">the world only saved temporarily</a> from the ongoing desertification, and still reliant on (voluntary) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a> for its continued existence. The world might be saved for good some day... or it might be destroyed the *next* time something stops the ritual from taking place. Although the perfect ending provides a hope spot where a researcher is investigating a promising lead to reverse the desertification. The 3DS remake added an epilogue chapter in which the cause of the desertification can be dealt with permanently, ending the need for the ritual and allowing for the possibility that the land will eventually recover.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> the Dalish Warden can request to have the Hinterlands set aside to become the new Dalish homeland, as their boon for ending the Blight and slaying the Archdemon. It's vague what actually happened, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> hints that this didn't go well;

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em> has you defeat the Seneschal, whose job is to will the world to continue to exist, and take his place. He then asks you to kill him, as he's tired from eons of sitting alone beyond the Rift. Unfortunately, the only way to end the game at this point is to turn the Godsbane on yourself, <em>killing the being responsible for the cohesion of the world before a new replacement comes along</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> makes it clear the world <em>didn't</em> end, and perhaps even that stabbing yourself didn't work, as you'll eventually come face to face with your old Arisen as the new Seneschal when you again reach the final boss. It doesn't make it clear exactly what stabbing yourself <em>did</em> if it <em>didn't</em> kill you the first time around, though.</span>
</li><li> Over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline">The Matrix Online</a></em>'s storyline, not only do large numbers of humans in the real world take up permanent residence in large hover barges, some choose to work for the Machines. As the storyline progressed, Zion and the Machines were embroiled in a cold war where the Machines worked to suppress Zion's recruitment efforts in secret and Zion was preparing for another war. It's very likely that, had the game not been shut down, future story arcs would have explored a second war between the Machines in Zion - one where Zion now has a way of causing real harm to the Matrix and the Machines who are dependent on it for survival.
</li><li> From this very Wiki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltBasedGaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltBasedGaming">Guilt-Based Gaming</a> page: when was the last time you saw someone with or even <em>mention</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a>? You know, the virtual pets known for dying if you leave them unattended? That's right. The fad's long over, so <em>just about every Tamagotchi is dead.</em>
</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland">Dead Island</a></em> wasn't quite the emotional rollercoaster that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">heartbreaking trailer promised</a>, it does explore this in several ways. One is by making it very clear that each and every one of the zombies you're cheerfully dismembering was a human being, either by interaction with NPCs, discovery of supplemental materials, or the subsequent trailer showing holidaymakers alive and well, and being recognisable from the game as being the same zombies you fight. The second is that a decent amount of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">fetch quests</a> aren't just to keep people happy, but are for medical supplies for the wounded and prescription medicine such as insulin and asthma inhalers, without which the patients would die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first game, there's whole thing with Ishimura, where one of the biggest mining spaceships ever built is heavily damaged (and it causes several subsequent Necromorph outbreaks). That's not so bad, if mankind wasn't relying on <em>tearing planets apart</em> to cover its resource needs. It gets worse when Isaac <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drops an already pulled-out chunk of Aegis 7 back on its surface, effectively destroying the whole planet</span>. By that point it wasn't inhabited, but still.
</li><li> In the second game, it pushes this beyond mere material horizon by having a Necromorph outbreak in a densely populated space station. While some evacuation ships are seen to take off and there are emergency prompts, there are also quite a disturbing number of on-screen human casualties. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The whole station eventually gets destroyed, along with the spaceship Ishimura from first game.</span>
</li><li> The third game forgets about some working civilisation - after three years have passed, full scale war between the Unitologists and Earth Government has begun, and worse, the Unitologists are winning. Even the task force retrieving Isaac refers to themselves as "Earthgov's last battalion", which means that this conflict is likely coming to a (bad) end. In the first mission, the player gets to look into this war - essentially urban warfare combined with Unitology-caused Necromorph outbreaks, and this is implied to happen all over the colonies.
</li><li> <em>Awakened DLC</em> takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, by showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">giant Necromorph</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon">moons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater">attacking Earth</a></span>. Depressing end, indeed.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony</a> in his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em>. Although there is a brief scene in which it's shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at least one Booker survived their time-wipe</span>, this still ultimately leaves baby-Elizabeth in the care of a violent, alcoholic, self-destructive Booker who may or may not be neck-deep in gambling debts to a lot of bad people.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> (and really, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a>), this happens depending on who you lose to. Seeing how there is no referee or security enforcing any rules, and every tournament after <em>1</em> is stated to be funded by outright corrupt people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> suggests that the outcomes of some losses could be very ugly indeed. Yeah, losing to Ryu, Ken, or Chun Li might suck, but say whatever else you want about them, they aren't cold-blooded killers. Now people like Vega (US) (a sexually fixated sadist), M. Bison (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, mad scientist, demon worshipper, all around homicidal maniac), and Juri (confirmed shameless sadist who gets off on pain and suffering): some combatants' win quotes out and out say they're going to beat, kill, or torture the loser after the match is over.
</li><li> The Heartless in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> go around and attack the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Keyholes</a> in each world, destroying the world and making their residents fall into darkness forever; or, if they're lucky, they'll end up in the refugee world of Traverse Town. It isn't really discussed in the games beyond witnessing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Destiny Islands</a> fall in the first game, but at the end of that game you see all of the destroyed worlds get restored, represented by missing stars reappearing in the sky, and there is a <em>lot</em> of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> opens with the entire planet bombarded from orbit, wiping out most of <em>everything</em>. The ending shows at least some humans have survived some unspecified time after the game's events, but really, the vast majority of people who survived the initial blasts would have died of disease, starvation or exposure, and that's before considering the horrific damage done to the biosphere. As for the Tasen, even in the best possible outcome only a handful survive, far too little to preserve the species. It's implied <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Komato</span> will collapse into civil war now that their hated enemies are gone. Daniel Remar said much of this was going to be explored when he was thinking of things to include in a sequel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">but then he lost interest in making one</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> series features vastly changed landmasses between games, with little indication of whether its populace died from a world changing cataclysm or survived those changes and died from the passage of time. A greater variety of non-human creatures are found in earlier games than later games, some moving from Sosaria to Serpent Isle, while others appear extinct. There are significantly less people in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em> than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em>, as the Age of Armageddon is in full effect, and Skara Brae has its own sequence detailing the town's destruction. The preceding two adventures, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a>: Serpent Isle</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a>: Pagan</em>, have The Avatar trigger continent wide destructive magical forces before leaving for another dimension without fully reverting the effects of those disasters.

Then there's the giant tsunami that would arise from the event and then spread across the Pacific...

However, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> has Reynardo escape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">with his love-interest</a>, he leaves the Emperor and most of his fleet destroyed, and the Rebel Council dead. There's no apparent reason why the rest of the empire should fare any better than in any other 'both sides got killed' ending, suggesting that it's not a particularly happy ending for anyone BUT Reynardo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> also survives in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> - with no-one left behind to tell whatever remains of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> that he IS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>.

He ends up getting a bit more than he bargained for, as he ends up causing the tower to collapse. While it's never brought up, it's highly likely that a lot of people died in the collapse, both the Hammerites inside the tower, and the people on the streets whose houses were crushed. Even if we assume that there was ample warning and time to evacuate before the tower fell... there's still all the Hammerites that the player had likely knocked out and left unconscious in out-of-the-way places.

Law created a world where humanity was enslaved to simply worship God by Zelenin's song, but even beyond the death of free will, the song is not perfect. The angels themselves say it didn't work for them because humanity's heart changed too much, and in gameplay, it's simply an extremely powerful, high-chance Charm effect and vulnerable to all the usual counters to that. So what happens to the people it doesn't affect? Neutral strongly implies the Schwarzwelt will return, and that humanity will have grown too complacent from their previous victory to resist it.

<ul><li> Let's reconsider the battle against Graviton in "Breakout: Part 2". The hellicarrier and the prison inside it fell into the ocean; could they evacuate that many people? (including super-villains). The whole of Manhattan island was taken out of the ground and then fell back: that can only generate a tsunami right next to New York, and a huge earthquake. In the battle, several buildings were destroyed or used as weapons (and nobody ever said that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">Conveniently Empty</a>). To finally defeat him, Thor summons a thunderbolt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">that seems like an atomic explosion</a>. A bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>: after that absolute devastation, <em>Thor wants to celebrate</em> that they defeated the bad guy. But well, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, and for people like him, there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">No Endor Holocaust</a>.
</li><li> That, however, was <em>nothing</em> compared to the events of "Gamma World, parts 1 and 2". At the end of the first part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig">The Leader</a> managed to lure the Avengers into his trap and activated a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">gamma satellite</a> that subjected <em>everyone</em> in the area of Las Vegas (including the Avengers themselves, minus Hawkeye and The Hulk) to the same gamma radiation that turned Bruce Banner into the green goliath, effectively turning everyone in the range of the satellite into Hulk-like monsters who started punching each other and causing destruction everywhere. This means, (not even getting into the aftermath of said transformations, or into the effects of gamma radiation on the elderly, the infirm or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">children and babies</a>), that about <strong>600,000 people</strong> (according to 2010 demographics) simultaneously turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">rage monsters</a> strong enough to level buildings and massacre entire armies. We don't know exactly for how long was the satellite operating, but even if the effect somehow lasted only five measly minutes, that would have been enough for the whole city to become rubble and ash and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">for hundreds (or even thousands) to either die or suffer long-lasting effects and/or injuries</a>. Yet the two-parter ends on a happy note with everyone returning to their human form, Las Vegas somehow not completely erased from the map, Hawkeye and The Hulk returning to the team and The Leader being imprisoned. It's even dumber when you realize that Iron Man had the same heart problems as in the films, and yet, despite turning into a Hulk himself and a visual showing the device in his heart getting destroyed in the transformation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">he was completely fine in the end</a>.
</li><li> And let's not even <em>begin</em> with Kang's invasion "Come the Conqueror" and "The Kang Dynasty", which is a worldwide one. Explosions worldwide, blitzkriegs worldwide, killer robots worldwide... in New York alone, the focus of the episode, there are cars exploding or flying around, buildings damaged or destroyed, fires without control, the Brooklyn Bridge was destroyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and the glasses of a small kid were broken</a>.
</li><li> When Malekith opened the casket of the ancient winters in the episode of the same name, he unleashed a worldwide ice age and released ice monsters everywhere. But, as it was magic, it may be safely assumed that when Thor closed the casket <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">everything got back to normal</a> (perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">including</a> any collateral damage caused by the ice and the monsters).
</li><li> In "Along Came a Spider", the street collapses and falls over a subway train. The passengers who leave it are at the station and see the roof falling and run away... but what about the passengers who were still inside the train, going to some other station?

By the end of the episode, they are stopped, but the machine still was activated and caused a volcanic eruption in the middle of Bellwood (we see a driving car being engulfed by magma, so at least one person died for sure). It's <em>really</em> hard to swallow that nobody died in this, seeing how entire buildings were seen being consumed. To make it worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">the Kraaho aren't even punished for that</a>.

Of course, they have parachutes, and are careful to show this... but they hardly ever show them being rescued. There are three given alternatives; either be unlucky enough to descend into the wastelands (a volcanic, monster-filled floor to the Atmos), go into one of the deep gorges where atmospheric pressure grows great enough to <em>crush ships</em>, or drift on air currents until reaching a Terra (which has thus far only happened once to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfDeadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfDeadness">main good guy</a>).

Even though fairy magic has a rule that fairy magic cannot be used to seriously harm or kill people <em>directly</em>, it's a bit hard to believe there aren't <em>some</em> people who get caught in the crossfire of some wishes, such as ones that result in erupting volcanos, or giant monsters rampaging throughout the city and tearing down buildings, and given "Da Rules" are infamous for the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> that gets pulled throughout the series...

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> diesels really <em>are</em> going to take over, most of the steam trains in the world really <em>are</em> going to be scrapped, and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> many of the actual class of engines on which the characters are based are completely extinct. However, some stories (particularly in the books) take place a good deal later than the 1950s, and some are even in <em>this</em> century. Sodor had a great degree of operating independence and lacked the labor clashes that cemented Dieselisation on the British mainland. It is, in-universe, the one place to avoid it due to the Fat Controller having the authority to opt out as well as Sodor's economic prosperity.

It is stated that the world economy has been halted, and it is believed that everyone except prepared survivalists will die. It turns out the disease isn't fatal, and everything is back to normal by the next episode. The world economy shutting down for weeks should have had a much more lasting effect, even if we assume every character is cynical enough to just ignore the inevitable riot deaths during the believed pandemic.

</li><li> The series ends with Rex curing every Evo in the world. The end has a casual mention that there will still be nanites. Of course, this is because they weren't a hundred percent sure whether they were writing a season finale or a series finale. If it's the series finale, then there's the connotation that, if everyone's nanites are still there and active, then the thing that makes it such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> - the fact that <em>everyone</em> is a ticking time bomb whose nanites can say "let's turn this person into a feral, rampaging monster whose appearance and powers would give Lovecraft nightmares" at <em>any second</em> - has not changed at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode Oberon puts almost everyone in Manhattan to sleep for several minutes, during which he also conjures a freezing rain storm. Yes, a couple of traffic accidents are shown when everyone falls asleep, but nobody calls him on it when he claims everyone will wake up just fine. Unless he put far more thought into his spell than it looked like (and judging by what he seems to think of the rights of anyone aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">his own kind</a>, he probably didn't), then it's likely that between traffic accidents, interrupting dangerous tasks, or simply falling from precarious places, thousands of people died. Everything is back to normal by the next episode, as though nobody outside Manhattan even noticed.
</li><li> In "City of Stone", Demona turns all the New Yorkers into statues and goes about smashing them (obviously killing them). We only get to see her kill a few people on screen, but she was strolling down the street, no doubt smashing more. We also know people flying helicopters or working heavy machinery aren't immune, because Fox was also turned to stone, and only the timely action of Xanatos prevented their chopper from crashing into the ground. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Greg Weisman</a> is well aware of this and confirms that many people died off-screen.
</li><li> In "Grief", the mad Jackal unleashes a 'wave of death' outside of the temple in Egypt. While the heroes within the temple that he individually blasted are aged/de-aged rather than killed, outside we see trees crumble into dust, crocodiles reduced to skeletons, and an <em>entire city</em> fall into ruin. While the aging is reversed at the episode's end, the avatar confirms that those who are dead and gone cannot be brought back. If that was Giza that got blasted, that means <em>three million people died in that episode</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow">The Super Mario Bros Super Show!</a></em> episode "Koop-zilla" apparently takes place in a fictional Japanese city called Sayonara. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Because of a lab experiment gone wrong</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Bowser</a> actually transforms into the titular Koop-zilla and starts destroying the city, and as a result, Mario also becomes a giant just so he can stop Bowser, causing the city to be destroyed even more. A later episode called "Karate Koopa" also takes place in Sayonara, except that instead of a large, technologically-advanced metropolis, it's now a small Japanese fishing village, and Bowser is now a samurai. By the way, Sayonara means "goodbye" in Japanese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Hearth's Warming Eve play suggests the ponies fled their original home for Equestria due to monsters making it unlivable. There remains the question, what if some ponies stayed or got left behind?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Discord</a>, the villain of the "Return of Harmony" two-parter, was said to rule Equestria before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Celestia and Luna</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">sealed him in stone</a>. As shown in the two-parter, within hours of his escape he plunges Equestria into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a> in which time, gravity, causality and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldGoneMad">sanity</a> are entirely optional. A stained glass window depicts him <em>holding ponies over a pit of fire with puppet strings</em> while agonized screams are audible in the background.
</li><li> In the season 4 finale, when Tirek drained the pegasi of their magic, depriving them of flight and presumably their cloudwalking ability as well, one would think that the residents of Cloudsdale fell out of the sky to their doom.
</li><li> The Season 5 finale gets a double dose of this due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> theme <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is one of the reasons why Starlight Glimmer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">easy forgiveness and effortless redemption</a> was so controversial among fans</span>:
<ul><li> You never see the entire cast of characters in any one future, and while it is possible they were simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, nothing is said to guarantee they're not dead or worse. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance were in the Crystal Empire when King Sombra was freed meaning they likely died trying to defend it or worse were fitted with mind control helmets and forced to fight their loved ones, Applejack and Rarity lived in Ponyville when Queen Chrysalis took over meaning (since she knew of their forms in a timeline where they <em>weren't</em> heroes) they were likely killed or enslaved by her. The final timeline looks like something out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em> and has <em>no life in sight</em>, making it the clearest example of this.
</li><li> Of course, it also carries the baggage of any such plot where worst-case scenario all these alternate timelines and the people within them suffered greatly and then ceased to exist, or possibly are now <em>still suffering</em> in alternate timelines. Of course, in any case, these people in these altered timelines still lived, suffered, and died all the same. Pretty heavy stuff for <em>My Little Pony</em>, when you think about it.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the season 6 episodes, an adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em>, has the Scrooge analogue being presented with the possibility of their actions causing a never-ending winter.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> has a massive chunk of Canterlot outright obliterated for a cheap laugh by Tirek and Cozy Glow. Lets just hope that entire area just <em>happened</em> to be empty, all that falling debris just <em>happened</em> to not hit anyone, and that gigantic beam of instant destruction with the mile-long diameter just <em>happened</em> to not hit anyone or anything. In fact, all we know for certain is that five guards happened to survive since Cozy Glow dumped them outside to get rid of them, as Twilight only solemnly declares they will "rebuild" after considering all the damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Misplaced" has every single adult on the planet disappear (which isn't actually what happens, but the effect is the same). Even ignoring all those who were driving or flying or doing something else dangerous at the time, the situation is only fixed two or three days later, meaning <em>millions</em> of young children at the very least were left helpless for days.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> episode "Panic in the Sky", the Watchtower is invaded by multiple teams of Ultimen clones, led by Galatea, herself a Supergirl clone. Several scenes show Ultimen getting normal human Watchtower employees cornered, and preparing to kill them. The normal humans do fight back bravely, and we never see what happens to them, but it's very probable that they (along with numerous other humans offscreen) were flat out killed, as the Watchtower's security systems being down, and every single superhero who was on the station at the time was involved in a fight for their own lives, leaving said normals to fend for themselves against what effectively was an army of Kryptonian clones.
</li><li> While it is never said onscreen, the Edge of Beyond from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> is most likely a system that was torn apart by the Web and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Web Creatures</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> episode "Ocean Gem", the water from all the world's oceans (or at least a good chunk of the Atlantic) is magically taken to form a pillar reaching into outer-space. Although Steven does manage to fix this issue, it appears to have taken at least a day to do so; one can only <em>imagine</em> the effect that would have on the Earth's environment and economy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Episode 2 Old Man McGucket claims that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gone on murderous rampages in robots many times before and hasn't been caught</span>.
</li><li> Candy remarks that Several Timez "won't last a week" in the woods after Mabel lets them go. Subverted in that they live on garbage and have become scavengers.
</li><li> "Northwest Mansion Mystery" ends on a high note <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except for the apocalyptic prediction made by McGucket</span> with the townspeople now enjoying the party that had been promised to them generations ago, and Pacifica lifting a 150-year-old curse on her family. But as we've seen, her parents psychologically abused her into responding to a bell behind closed doors. So what do her parents have in store for her once everyone goes home for the night?
</li><li> At the end of "Not What He Seems", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> some of Gravity Falls was destroyed, the government agents are still after Stan and now everyone in Gravity Falls is fully aware of the town's supernatural secret from the gravity anomalies</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Brian on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> is treated like another human member of the family, even though his expected lifespan is drastically shorter than the others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Peter</a> makes several jokes about this. ("Wow, Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad that you're gonna die fifty years before I do."; "Beer that never goes flat!...That means that this beer still won't be flat by the time that you're dead and we...you know...get a new dog to help the kids forget you.")
</li><li> When Yugo uses the six Eliatrope Dofus to battle Ogrest in space during the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> OVA, he breaks off large chunks of Mount Zinit, which come crashing down to various cities on the World of Twelve. Although nobody is shown being killed by the meteors, they're dangerous enough to have Ruel claim, "It's the end of the world."
</li><li> In the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack and Ashi return to the past and kill Aku in Jack's time. Ashi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">vanishes soon after</a>, since she only exists because of Aku. What isn't shown is that the same thing must logically have happened to everyone else from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> that Jack has now erased, meaning that he spent so much time saving innocents, inspiring people, and making friends only to delete them all from existence</span>.
<ul><li> One should remember the final line of the main theme. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "... To undo the future that is Aku."</span> He does exactly that!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted in "Skytanic" where Cyril and Lana push a bomb off of a blimp...and realise that they just bombed Wales.
</li><li> In "Arrival/Departure" Kreiger rips out a nerve gas canister contained in a missile just before it goes off. Even though Kreiger says that the nerve gas was the only dangerous part, it could still potentially do collateral damage at whatever city it's aimed towards.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em> episode "Depth Charge", Atlantean soldiers flood New York, and the entire subway system is shown to be filled with water. Despite the sheer scale of this attack, not a <em>single mention</em> is ever made to any casualties, even though there had to be <em>a lot</em> of people in the subway when the floodwaters hit. There's a throwaway line at the very beginning of the episode noting that the entire city had been evacuated. Exactly how they were able to get the entire city evacuated that quickly, especially for an event that's pretty common in their universe (originally it was a monster attack) is a story for another trope.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> has Star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">completely destroy magic</a> to stop a monster genocide in Mewni... and in so doing, implicitly causes genocide on a <em>multiversal</em> scale, considering many creatures and civilizations seen throughout the series were either dependent on magic, or (like Star's spells and the Magical High Commission, the latter of whom explicitly die) were made of it. Considering one such creature was responsible for maintaining the space-time continuum, further problems may yet affect the multiverse. That's not even getting into the potentially lethal consequences of merging Earth and Mewni together, given the dangerous wildlife of Mewni, and Earth's own history of bigotry and oppression...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>'s series finale the Mandarin unleash a fog on New York that shuts down technology for a few hours and later releases it on Hong Kong. While the viewer is shown this affecting Iron Man and War Machine's respective armors and M.O.D.O.K.'s life support, we're not shown anything else, but given it almost killed Tony and M.O.D.O.K., it's likely between hospital being without power, various life support tech like pacemakers and respirators, traffic lights being out, and vehicles crashing, the Mandarin likely has a 1,000+, if not <em>1,000,000+</em>, body count to his name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has "Serious Business", where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">all the bathrooms on Earth break out of their houses and blast away</a>, and we're shown some people inside them. Judging by them spinning in a halo and the speed they leave Earth, it couldn't have ended well for them.
