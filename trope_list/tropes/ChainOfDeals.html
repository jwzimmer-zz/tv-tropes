</p><p>In a comedy, the chain either collapses or is rendered moot at the end. One common way of this happening is that the item the character at the end of the chain received breaks or is otherwise unsatisfactory, and the character decides to take his original bartered-away item back. The next character decides that, if <em>he</em> doesn't get what <em>he</em> wants, he'll take <em>his</em> original item back as well, and so on and so forth all the way back up the chain. An alternative to this is that character Z wants what character A originally needed, thus closing character A off from the loop.
</p><p>This is common enough in fairy tales to have its own <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarne-Thompson">Aarne-Thompson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> type number (550). The best-known variants are "Ivan Tsarevitch and the Grey Wolf" and "The Golden Bird", both of which follow the same pattern: The protagonist is tasked (by a wolf in the first story, a fox in the second) to steal a bird from a castle. He gets caught, but the king of the castle offers to give him the bird if he'll steal a horse from the second castle. He gets caught again, and sent to fetch a princess from a third castle in exchange for the horse. In the end, with the help of the wolf/fox, he manages to keep all three.

On her way home, a woman asks her to lend her the branch to show to her bed-ridden relative — Sumiko gives her the branch and receives a bag full of organic vegetables. She leaves the vegetables with a colleague of hers, receiving tickets to a play for helping her colleague to get her picky kids to eat vegetables. When trying to cash the ticket in, she's approached by men who want to buy the ticket off of her for a famous woman to view the play and the woman gives her a rare, limited edition bag.

A poor peasant prays to the goddess of mercy for relief from his miserable life. She tells him to travel west with the first thing he picks up off the ground on leaving the temple, which turns out to be a piece of straw. He trades through his travels until fortunate circumstances lead to the hand in marriage of the daughter of a millionaire. One unique difference, however, is that the tale generally has most if not all trades actually consist of the peasant freely giving what he has to someone in need without expectations of payment, but receiving items as tokens of gratitude.

<ul><li> In one fairy-tale, Hans trades all the way up to marrying a Princess.
</li><li> In another fairy-tale, Hans trades all the way down to nothing (but is still happy, because the last thing he traded for was a freaking huge millstone that did nothing but weigh him down).
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm080.html">Death of the Little Hen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>": The Hen starts choking on a nut, so her husband, the Rooster, rushes off to the well to get her some water. The well will only give him some water if he brings it a nearby bride's red silk shawl. The bride will only part with the shawl if the Rooster recovers her wreath, which is caught in a tree. By the time the Rooster completes the quests and makes it back to the Hen with the water, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">she's already choked to death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a Czech fairy-tale "About the Little Rooster and the Little Hen". The Little Hen and the Little Rooster go searching for nuts (strawberries in another version) together, and the Little Rooster suggests they share everything they find. The Little Hen does share her nut, but the Little Rooster gets greedy and eats a whole nut by himself. He chokes on it and sends the Little Hen for water. The longest chain has the Little Hen asking the Sky to give dew to a Meadow, then the Meadow will give grass to a Cow, then the Cow will give cream to a Malster, then the Malster will give draff to a Sow, then the Sow will give bristles to a Shoemaker, then the Shoemaker will give shoes to a Seamstress, then the Seamstress will give a headscarf to a Well, and then the Well will give water to her and she will give the water to her Little Rooster. The Sky has mercy on her and gives the Meadow dew. Poor Little Hen only takes a beakful of water from the Well. In one version, she comes too late and the Little Rooster dies; in the more commonly known version, she gives him water and he jumps on his legs, healthy, and crows happily.
</li><li> In a Russian fairy tale a rooster choked on a bean. His hen hurried to the housewife asking for some butter to lube rooster's throat, but the woman needed some milk from the cow, who needed the farmer to cut some grass for her, but the farmer needed a scythe from the blacksmith, so the hen ran to the smith, got a scythe and unwound the sequence. Naturally, cynical Russians spoofed the story, so when the hen reaches the blacksmith...
<div class="indent"><strong>Hen:</strong> Oh, good blacksmith, please give me a scythe. Our farmer will cut some grass for the cow, who will give milk, which the housewife shall churn into butter that I will lube rooster's throat with for he choked on a bean. <br/><strong>Blacksmith:</strong> Why sure, I can give you a scythe, but I also have some butter, wouldn't it be easier if I just give it to you? <br/><strong>Hen:</strong> Yeah? And fuck up such a cool quest?!

The last one does so, and the whole cascade ensues.
<div class="indent"><strong>Old Woman:</strong> Cat, kill rat! Rat won't gnaw rope, rope won't hang butcher, butcher won't kill ox, ox won't drink water, water won't put out fire, fire won't burn stick, stick won't beat dog, dog won't bite pig, pig won't jump over the stile, and I shan't get home tonight!
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">Inverted</a> in several stories, with each succeeding item being worth less than the one traded away:
<ul><li> A Scandinavian fairy tale about a man who bets someone that his wife loves him no matter what, and to prove it he has the other man listen by the door while he relates to his wife how he didn't take the cow to the market this morning, but traded it for a horse, which he then traded for a goat, and so on until he finally tells her that he traded a rooster for a meal since he was hungry, so essentially he gave the cow away with nothing to show for it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s "What the Goodman Does is Always Right", a man trades a horse for a cow, the cow for a sheep, the sheep for a goose, the goose for a chicken, and finally the chicken for a sack of shrivelled apples. Two Englishmen who witness these trades say that the man's wife will give him no end of grief for it, and the man says that no, she'll hug him and declare that what he does is always right. The Englishmen offer to bet him a hundred weight of gold on the matter and he says no, only a bushel is enough, since he has only a bushel of apples to wager against them. They all return to the house, and the man recounts his trades; at each step this wife declares that it was a wonderful trade and gives her reasons. In the end, she laughs with delight at the sack of shrivelled apples because she had gone to borrow a handful of herbs from the schoolmistress and been told "Lend?" I don't have anything to lend you. I couldn't even lend you a shrivelled apple!" and now the wife could lend her "...ten, or a whole sack-full! It makes me laugh to think it." The Englishmen cheerfully pay the bet, with their original offer of a hundredweight of gold.

Showing a Gyarados to Marie in Camphrier Town will get him a letter that he can give to Jacques in Parfum Palace, earning him a Farfetch'd, which he can trade for a Beartic, which he can trade for a Furfrou — and a shiny one, at that. He can then eventually convince a stylist in Luminose City to give the Furfrou a stylish haircut, which he can show to the Gym Leader, Valerie, to get a Focus Sash, which he can trade in Anistar City for a Silk Sash, which he can give to a girl in Luminose for a Pokémon that can dance, which he can then show to someone in Courmarine City for a Heart Scale, which he can then give the Move Relearner to reteach Alakazam Teleport. Got all that? Now, listen to this: when he talks to Professor Oak to get the Dragonite, he learns that he could have borrowed Misty's Gyarados or Ash's Totodile (who can dance), and the professor not only knows someone who has a Clefairy, but has in his possession a Focus Sash, a Silk Sash, <em>twenty</em> Heart Scales, and a <em>TM</em> for Teleport. Gary is understandably frustrated, but since he went through the trouble of building the list, he borrows Dragonite and Gyarados, leaving him with an Anorith, a shiny Furfrou, and a Teleporting Alakazam.

He manages about nine or ten trades easily, but the chain collapses because he never considered what <em>he</em> would want out of the whole deal. He accepts a piglet as payment in the final trade, but since he can't keep it at home or afford to board it elsewhere, the other boy offers to take it back.

Margaret agrees to not send in a negative report on Colonel Blake if Hawkeye will throw a birthday party (including a birthday cake) for Major Burns. Corporal "Radar" O'Reilly will get the cake if Hawkeye can get Nurse Murphy to go out with him. Nurse Murphy agrees to do so in return for a hair dryer. Corporal Klinger wants a Section Eight discharge (which must be signed by four officers) for his hair dryer. Unfortunately Hawkeye can't get Major Burns to sign, so in turn each person in the chain refuses to cooperate, causing the deal to collapse.

Zoey wants a ride to the book store to meet her favorite author, and when she asks her dorm advisor, Coco, to do it, Coco agrees if Zoey can get Micheal to cook his grandmother's ravioli recipe. Micheal will do it if Stacey will finish their school project by herself while he cooks. Zoey convinces Stacey to finish the project if Zoey can get her a date with Logan. Logan (reluctantly) agrees to go on a date with Stacey if Zoey gets back his class ring he lost in a bet with Dustin. Dustin will give the ring back if Zoey convinces Lola to be his assistant in his magic show. Lola, who's looking after a teacher's baby, agrees to do it if Zoey can find someone else to look after the baby. Zoey gets Chase to do it if Zoey can get a group of comic book nerds to stop trying to befriend him. The nerds agree to leave Chase alone if they can have a computer software that Quinn invented.

<ul><li> Several of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> games, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em>, include an item-trading quest of some sort:
<ul><li> The one in <em>Link's Awakening</em> nets you a Magnifying Glass that will allow you to see invisible enemies, get the Boomerang, <em>and</em> reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, making it the only game where a trading sequence is partially required.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> has two, one in the past and the other in the future.
<ul><li> In the past, it starts right after Link shows Zelda's letter to the Kakariko guard protecting the entrance to Death Mountain. After the guard is convinced that Link is allowed by the Royal Family to go to the mountains, he asks him to bring a Keaton Mask to him as a present for his son. From there, Link has to receive a mask from the Happy Mask Shop in Market, sell it to someone and then give payment to the Mask Salesman so he can receive the following mask and repeat the process. After four successful sales, you'll receive the Mask of Truth, which allows you to receive hints from the Gossip Statues. You'll be able to access three other masks, too, but they're purely cosmetic.
</li><li> The trading sequence from the future is more traditional in terms of gameplay. It starts with a Chicken Egg used to wake up a long-dormant Talon once it hatches, and continues through most of Hyrule by trading items one after another. Some of the deliveries are timed (for example, the Odd Mushroom must be given away in three minutes or else it will spoil), and in particular, the penultimate one is impossible to do without Epona (even with her, it's very difficult if you forgot to plant a Magic Bean near the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern in the past). The final reward is the powerful Biggoron's Sword.
</li></ul></li><li> The one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em> doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhov's Boomerang</a>. In your first three days, you must get the Moon's Tear and give it to the Deku salesman in South Clock Town so you can use his flower to reach Clock Tower. You can do this again in the next 3-day cycles, but instead of using the flower, you can give the town flower deed to another Deku salesman at the swamp to get the swamp flower's deed. And then you can trade that for another deed on the mountains. And that one for another deed at the ocean. And finally, that one gets you a flower deed at Ikana Canyon. Each of the five flowers lets you grab a Piece of Heart to increase your health, and at the end of the chain, you also obtain 200 rupees from the last salesman.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">Oracle</a></em> games have one each to get the Level-2 sword (or Level-3 sword if you already have the Level-2 sword in a linked game). Unlike <em>Link's Awakening</em>, this quest is totally optional. It's also possible to avoid it entirely in <em>Seasons</em>. In <em>Ages</em> the chain of deals is to get the broken sword so it can be repaired, but in <em>Seasons</em> the final deal gets you a phonograph that encourages a Deku scrub to tell you how to find the sword in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">The Lost Woods</a>. Thus you can look the trick up on-line and avoid having to trade anything. Also in <em>Ages</em> you have to complete another (short) chain to acquire the two keys for the sixth dungeon on rolling ridge.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em>, the resident trading sequence is a bit different, in that you're not only trading items but selling them as well, as the characters involved are merchants. Finishing it nets you a Piece of Heart, and completing at least part of it grants you the Magic Armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em> has one that spans through all four quadrants of the World of the Ocean King, and involves all characters that travel in ships (except Jolene). It ends in Molida Island, where Link receives a scroll that teaches him the Great Spin Attack.
</li></ul></li><li> The fan-made game <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/253819">The Legend of Zelda and the Lampshade of No Real Significance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> has this as the entire plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> has the player engage in a series of trades to get enough cash to pay Watto in Mos Eisley.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI">Suikoden</a></em> has a classic example, where recruiting a particular member of the 108 Stars of Destiny requires you to run through a long chain in order to get soap for a washing-woman who's run out. When you actually succeed, it turns out that she'd just discovered that she wasn't out of soap after all, but in acknowledgement of the trouble you went through to get her soap, she joins you anyway.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, where you help a penguin cross a stream and get started in a trading sequence that takes you through every little island on the map, eventually unlocking an area with a bonus boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> features the "Catherine's Request" and "Shamir's Request" sidequests. They each want something called a "two-toned whetstone". There is little hint on how to obtain it, but when you finish speaking with them, you may notice a Tome of Crestological Mysteries nearby on the ground. If you give this to Hanneman, he will give you the Tome of Comely Saints, which you have to give to Manuela in exchange for the Fire Amulet, which you give to Cyril, so on and so forth... until you end up with <em>one</em> two-toned whetstone, the only one in the entire game. Choose wisely which questgiver you give it to... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unless you plan on taking the Crimson Flower Route, in which case you should give it to Shamir. Catherine can't be recruited on that route.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games that let you trade with people online, you can do this kind of trade with real-life players all over the world - with enough careful thought about what people might be willing to trade. In about a dozen trades, you can exchange a level 6 Magikarp for a level 100 Mewtwo. (Eventually the GTS managed to get <em>filled</em> with people offering low-level common Pokemon for level-100 legendaries, and <em>the other way around</em>.)
</li><li> An old Japanese legend tells of a man who started off with a single piece of straw, and traded up until he was rich. This was referenced in two video games:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHeartsCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHeartsCovenant">Shadow Hearts: Covenant</a></em>, where a sidequest starts off with a man telling the player this story and giving them a straw. Eventually, the player can trade this to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> for one of the characters. To be fair, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperFanOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperFanOfDoom">pretty, yet magical, steel fan</a>, unless the player makes a wrong trade and ends up with worthless junk (or a small fortune in cash).
</li><li> The legend is referenced and inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em>, where a character starts off with money for dinner ingredients, but ends up going through a chain ending in a single piece of straw.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BugFables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BugFables">Bug Fables</a></em> Vi wants to get red paint for her sister Jaune, and must complete a large chain of deals to acquire it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The games occasionally force you to go on a variant of this, in which an animal wants to get an item back from another one who borrowed it... but then you go there and discover that that animal lent the item to someone else. You have to keep following the item until you get it and can bring it back to its owner. It can get really weird when half the village is sharing the same handkerchief.
</li><li> <em>Wild World</em> had a particularly egregious example of this combined with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> in how players could obtain the Golden Axe. By growing a red turnip (which on its own can be infuriating as their seeds can only be purchased before noon on Sundays and require at least 5 days of very precise gardening to grow sufficiently), and trading it to a hungry NPC who can appear randomly any weekday, players have a 50/50 chance to receive a turban. Then, this must be traded to a different NPC who can also randomly appear on any weekday, to have a 50/50 chance at receiving a massage chair. Then, this chair must be given to the town mayor, who will only appear during holidays and selected events, who will then give you a scallop. Finally, you need to wait for <em>another</em> random daily NPC to appear to give the scallop to, and there is once again a 50/50 chance he will give you the Golden Axe. Sure it took you several real-world weeks (unless you resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward">but at least your axe will never break again</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has you getting caught in one of these while trying to get some stolen comic books back for the Gnomish Gnomads. Not only is the quest optional, the reward is rather underwhelming: the Gnomitronic Hyperspatial Demodulizer, a combat item that does a handful of damage, but gives you a brief boost to all stats if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">use it to finish off an enemy</a>. When you finally complete the chain of deals, the quest-giver starts to claim that you'll need to complete <em>another</em> chain of deals to get the Demodulizer's batteries, to which you respond by yanking on his ear until he hands you the batteries himself. The quest also refers to one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples: the only item you actually retrieve yourself is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> big red paperclip in the Haiku Dungeon</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>:
<ul><li> Before you even reach the first of the four Fiends of Chaos, you end up partaking in what is effectively a chain of deals. Unlike most cases, however, not all the trades are deliberate; the members of the sequence are an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunmen</a>.
<ul><li> The treasure vaults in Castle Cornelia have been bound with the mystic key.
</li><li> Matoya the witch is blind; the crystal eye that gives her vision has recently been stolen.
</li><li> Upon acquiring a ship from Bikke the pirate, you discover that the inland sea is completely contained.
</li><li> Nerrick the dwarf is working on creating a canal, but needs nitro powder; another dwarf in Mount Durergar mentions that there is nitro powder in Cornelia.
</li><li> The prince of Elfheim is victim to a cursed slumber placed by Astos, king of the Dark Elves; another elf in the castle mentions that Matoya is capable of curing the affliction.
</li><li> The king of the Western Keep seeks the Crown hidden in the Marsh Cave nearby. Upon delivering it to him, he reveals himself as Astos, and claims that he can become true elf king with the mystic power of the Crown in combination with... the crystal eye he pilfered from Matoya.
</li><li> Upon defeating Astos and delivering the crystal eye to Matoya, she gives you a jolt tonic in thanks. Upon administering the jolt tonic to the elf prince, he recognizes the Warriors of Light and passes on the mystic key. Upon opening the treasure vault in Castle Cornelia, the Warriors of Light discover a store of nitro powder. Upon handing the nitro powder to Nerrick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontAskJustRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontAskJustRun">he tells you to get your ass out of the blast zone</a>.
</li><li> The Crown also serves a later purpose; the Citadel of Trials, which must be cleared for the mid-game class change, requires proof of valor in order to enter, and the Crown is proof enough.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Dawn of Souls</em> remake of the game, there's a separate Chain of Deals puzzle that involves trading things between a bunch of dwarves in order to progress in a dungeon.
</li></ul></li><li> All the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> games have NPCs who want to trade BattleChips with you. Most of the trades are standalone, but in games 3 and 6, you can make several successive trades to obtain a powerful chip. You can screw the chain up in 6 by dumping one of the in-between chips (DublShot C) in the trader; it's almost impossible to get another one in C code. This sounds like a hard mistake to make — who puts their last one of something in the trader? — but the BN6 boards at GameFAQs get more threads asking about this than anything else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle">Ogre Battle</a></em> has at least one of these in the series. The original SNES game, Episode IV, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">March of the Black Queen</a> had several. The first you see is the powerful Ring of Undead, held by a wizard early in the game who would trade it for a Lexicon of Undead. And then there is the Diaspola chain. You start with some pirates with a copy of The Saga who are looking for a Map, which is in town with a man who is looking for Amatsu that can be found in the trade shop of neighboring town who only buys Furs which an underhanded sneak has and will part ways with if you give him all you money or return his stolen goblet held by bandits who want to hear a Foul Tome you received from a previous stage. Each of these items is worth progressively more than the previous.
</li><li> The desert monkey cave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em> is basically a Puzzle Chain of Deals. With some lampshading thrown in ("amongst all these doors..."). Thankfully it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">funny</a>. Some players still consider it the most frustrating part of the game, mostly because <em>every room looks like every other room</em> and one item turns into something else (thus rendering it useless) after too much time passes. Fortunately, the player's guide (which was originally packaged with the game) eliminated most of the frustration by providing maps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfEvermore">Secret of Evermore</a></em>'s Nobilia market blatantly uses this, though it's entirely optional. It's even pretty complex, with multiple traders giving the same item for different exchanges, but the rewards you can get through it are items that permanently boost your abilities, so it's worth your time and resources.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonNest">Dragon Nest</a></em>, a dishonest merchant dares you to trade rotten apple for gold to get your debt removed. You go and give the apple to an arc then trade it with some mud, then you trade the medical mud for some crystal shards from a sorceress, then you trade the shards for gold.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RomancingSaGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RomancingSaGa">Romancing SaGa</a></em> involved a large trade quest kicked off when Strom (Water Elemental Lord) demands the "Raincloud Armlet" in exchange for a captive princess. It's in the possession of Adyllis (Earth Elemental Lord), who will only give it up if you give him the Cyclone Shoes, which you can only get by trading the Ignigarde Helmet to Avi (Wind Elemental Lord) by acquiring the Ice Sword for Pyrix (Fire Elemental Lord) in which you must plunk down 20,000 gold or by killing a recruitable character. At any point in the chain, you can decide to brute-force the whole thing and just beat the crap out of the dragon, though and you get an awesome shield as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Item Drop</a>. However that does have some repercussions, by killing Strom you cannot get the optimal amount of jewels for doing the quest normally, are unable to do his Ecology Quest and also getting the chance to fight his Corrupted Form; Slask (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Item Drop</a> is the Chaosbringer; A powerful 2 Handed Axe that gives an Intellect boost). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This also bars you from exploring his temple later, meaning that you can't get the items inside — including the Water Spirit, which is required for <em>another</em> quest with <em>fantastic</em> rewards.</span> Also there is a trading ability for you to use in which you can trade items with monsters; so a mini chain is possible; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheGoldSaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheGoldSaucer">Sidetracked by the Gold Saucer</a> indeed.

By the time your character is halfway through building the very long chain of trades, he/she starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> the ridiculousness of the whole thing. In the end, the original quest-giver doesn't seem to think getting him the original favor was such a big deal as to warrant a <em>reward</em> until your character goes off on him. This quest involves trading favours through twenty steps, culminating in fixing a gnome's runway lights after basically trekking in a complete path around from Port Sarim through almost every other area on the map and ending up on the other side of the world, and then going <em>back</em>. Then the ungrateful bastard who gave you the quest doesn't even give you a reward until you explain what you had to go through for some <em>goddamn logs</em>.
<ul><li> And the developers have talked about making a sequel.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also one part of the Fremmenik Trials quest. You end up talking to basically everyone in the entire village until you talk to someone who just wants 5000 gold. Still better than the other in that you never have to leave the village, though.

While there are letters that are one-and-done, there's also one that starts a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_letters_in_Paper_Mario#Chain_Letters">chain of 14 letters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that you must deliver to NPCs from Chapter 1 to Chapter 7, and completing the sidequest nets you the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Lucky_Day">Lucky Day badge,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an item that greatly increases evasion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>, Merlee wants a crystal ball from Merluvlee, who in turn wants a training machine (actually a DS) from Bestovius, who in turn wants a mysterious DVD (implied to be porn) from Watchitt, who wants an autograph from Merlumina, who wants to go to sleep. Eventually, her long speeches bore you to sleep, causing her to get sleepy, leading to you completing the chain. Merlee repays you with a free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">charm</a> and a key that allows you to unlock the Pixl Piccolo.

Most of these tribes ask you to do something for them in exchange, often something you can't do until a different tribe joins you. For example, one tribe wants you to bring them a relic, and only monks can carry relics, so you have to get the tribe that gives you monks to join first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em> has one of these. The chain begins with a pink lollipop and ends with the single most powerful weapon upgrade attachment in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/JaysJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/JaysJourney">Jay's Journey</a></em> has one spanning most of the game, most (but not all) of which is required to complete the game. Jay sees this in progress and is more than happy to make bad deals, because he knows it'll all work out in the end. (He gets a bit annoyed when NPCs are slow to give rewards, or when one NPC tries to <em>steal</em> the trade-item-of-the-minute, however.) All of the items have an identical description: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Some trade item</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV">Breath of Fire IV</a></em> has this, too. In fact, it's needed for one of Ryu's Dragon forms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a> II</em> has a chain quest that spans virtually the entire campaign.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FamilyProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FamilyProject">Family Project</a></em>, Chunhua gets a free piece of candy on the street as an advertisement and gives it to Tsukasa. Tsukasa trades it for a pack of cigarettes. He gives the cigarettes to a guy on the street and gets a 5000 yen gift certificate. He uses that to pay Masumi's debt at some store or another, and she gives him thirty lottery tickets, enough for three tries at a game. Chunhua tries three times and eventually gets a personal computer worth 300,000 yen. Lampshaded.
</li><li> One of these shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>; you're not <em>doing</em> the Chain of Deals, rather you're one of the people <em>in</em> it.

Poor sap forgot to wash his hands.</span>
</li><li> Russian quest game <em>Last Year's Snow Was Falling</em> had a subversion of that. Once you understood the 5-step chain of deals and tried to grab the starting item, you were carried away to the next location.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Dubloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Dubloon">Dubloon</a></em>, you must trade items on Stern Island to get the map location of East Sea Serpent.
</li><li> Due to the introduction of player-to-player trading, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> can have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">thousands of people simultaneously attempting various self-invented chain-trades</a>. In order to get a certain hat for your friend, you have to go to someone else who has that hat, and who wants some other hat that you can get from another friend, etc.
<ul><li> Some players have done Red Stapler trading sequences, often managing to climb from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem">crate</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">something incredibly valuable</a>.
</li><li> There is actually a whole theoretical model built upon this: Various players do things called "Scrap Banking". For Scrap Banking, the Banker pays 1 scrap for any 2 weapons. In the crafting system, 2 weapons can be turned into 1 scrap if they are from the same class, so in theory the Banker is not losing any "revenue". He then sells the Weapons for 1 scrap each, effectively doubling his scraps with each pass. Any unsold items are crafted into scraps, combined with the others and re-"banked" into more weapons. Rinse and repeat. The problem with this, however, is that any player that can trade (those who have gotten a full version of the game) knows the values of expensive weapons, and would attempt to sell them on their own. The only weapons they'd scrap bank are ones everyone already has, or are widely abundant. This means that very rarely will this work, and if it works, it's only going to net you a very, very low net gain for the effort you put in.
</li><li> With the introduction of Steam Trading, you can now potentially trade up from a lowly, common crate all the way up to a $60 dollar game like Deus Ex, provided you get lucky enough and find the right buyers.

(For example, you have an apple and need to get an orange. However, the person who has an orange only wants a banana, so first you have to trade with the person who has a banana, who wants two lemons, so first you have to trade with the person who has lemons...)
</li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarksidersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarksidersII">its sequel</a> features a continuous array of deals that propels the story.

In exchange for a horse's freedom, someone wants a wheel to fix their cart, the blacksmith who has a wheel wants a blanket from Little Creek, Little Creek in turn wants an axe to chop wood with...and said axe can then be <strike>stolen</strike> taken from Snakefinger.
</li><li> This can happen between three or more players in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth">Heroes of Newerth</a></em>'s and other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em> clones' Single Draft mode where every player is given a choice from three random heroes that can be swapped between other players in your team.
</li><li> In the first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em>, one of the least favorite side-quests was to help someone with their trading service, which quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">went horribly wrong</a> because nobody can do an even trade, and one more item had to be fetched in order to even start the chain of deals. Everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">lampshades</a> how irritating this is.
</li><li> An obscure point-and-click adventure entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheDayTheWorldBroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheDayTheWorldBroke">The Day The World Broke</a></em> has a doozy of a chain. To get Carbine the half-Lizard, half-camera (all the non-human characters are half-animal, half-machine) to stop standing in the path of an element valve, which is causing chaos across Earth's surface, you need to fix his lens. The only place to get a lens is the Glass Works, where Carbine doesn't have the best reputation. That's a moot point, though, as the Glass Works is too busy filling orders for new glassware for Lugnut the bartender. So you need to get a note from Lugnut, who'll give it to you in exchange for getting rival bartender Decanter to part with rare bottle of sludge. In order to get that, Decanter wants a recording of a song his mother used to sing him, which requires an instrument that's notoriously difficult to find but fortunately is in the hands of one of Lugnut's customers, Ratchet, who will trade it to you for another instrument which <em>actually doesn't exist</em>, so you need to enlist the help of Phlange, who will help you make something that could pass for it, but in order to get Phlange to help you, you have to get her to stop standing in a different element valve. To get her to do this, you have to call Julius and Bud at Mission Control, who will finally convince her to leave, allowing you to get her help to make the instrument to trade for the other instrument to trade for the recording to trade for the sludge to trade for the note to trade for the lens. <em>Whew.</em>

Bring a Demon Mask to the amateur archaeologist so that he will give you the Obsidian Knife, which you'll give to a native who'll give you a Headdress, which you'll give to a tourist in exchange for a Jaguar Statue, which you'll give to another native in exchange for a rope, which—finally—will be used in an environmental puzzle instead.

<ul><li> You need to unify the main Council races against the Reapers. The turians aren't able to come unless the krogan can be brought to the vicious fighting on the turian homeworld, since the krogan are the most powerful ground-fighting force the galaxy has ever seen. The problem is that the krogan hate the turians and the salarians for hitting them with a sterility plague 1500 years ago, and have their own problems with the Reapers, although less of one; they refuse to come unless they get the genophage cured and ideally the Reaper scouts are dealt with. Thankfully, the salarians can be coerced into handing over the closest thing to a cure they have, although unless you sabotage the dispersal they'll sulk and refuse to commit to the mutual defence pact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unless one of your friends saves their Councillor from assassins</span> - and if you <em>do</em> sabotage the dispersal, you risk losing a lot of krogan support if the truth comes out.
</li><li> The sidequest to recruit the Blue Suns falls into this if you choose to take the Paragon route. The Blue Suns would be willing to join Shepard in the Reaper War, but they're currently being hassled by Citadel fleet patrols, led by turian general Oraka. Oraka is hassling them because the Suns are raiding trade shipments carrying high-end weapons needed for Citadel defense. He'll agree to leave the Suns alone if he can get weapons from an alternative source. You can find that source in a black-market dealer, but he won't deal in credits - he expects the economy to fall back to a barter system if the Reaper War is lost, and wants an advantage by acquring valuable artifacts to trade with, which you can only find in Reaper-occupied space. The Renegade option is much quicker: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">Oraka.</a>

Many of them are pretty comedic in nature; for example, at one point in <em>Half-Genie Hero</em>, to continue the main story, you need to find a Light Shard. There's a wizard hiding away in Mermaid Falls that has one, but he won't give it to you unless you give him candy. How do we get candy? First you have to go Tassel Town and use your Elephant Stomp ability to dig up ancient remains for a "geneology guy" at the bottom of the tower. Once you give him the remains, he... sneezes on you and gets you sick, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemGet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemGet">Item Get!</a> jingle. Now you need to head back to Scuttle Town and see a doctor for a quick check-up. And naturally, for being a good patient, he gives you a lollipop.

</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "Tri-State Treasure: Boot of Secrets", while at a swap-meet Candace tries to get an extremely rare Ducky Momo antique. The seller will only trade for another antique found at the swap-meet and what follows is Candace doing an extremely long chain of trading with very bizarre sounding items. Despite her efforts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">she still doesn't get the antique due to Doofenshmirtz's Inator ruining the antique she was going to trade for it.</a>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> episode, "Operation: Good Deed", Mason's back gets injured by a bucket and he needs a massage. King Julien will let the Penguins borrow Maurice, who gives excellent massages, if they can get him a flamingo feather for his crown, Pinky will give them one of her feathers in exchange for some peanuts, Burt will give them his peanuts in exchange for some hay, Roy will give them his hay if they can get Bada and Bing to stop throwing their banana peels into his habitat, and Bada and Bing will stop throwing their banana peels if they can get them a pizza.
</li><li> Baloo and Kit invoked one in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> where they flew odd cargoes around the world, opting to always turn down the offered cash at his destination and instead trade it for another odd cargo. Much to the disbelief of Kit, as the refused cash offers keep getting larger, and it was <em>his</em> money that started the chain (with the promise of getting double the money back). The final cargo they pick up is seemingly worthless, but upon returning to their point of origin, they learn that it's actually a very rare and valuable commodity and they net a small fortune selling it. Unfortunately, a pair of gangsters they annoyed at the start of the episode then show up, and in the panic to escape, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo">lose all but double the original</a> money they started with.
</li><li> Rainbow Dash &amp; Fluttershy's portion of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E19TradeYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E19TradeYa">Trade Ya</a>" features Rainbow Dash going through such a chain to get a first edition book she wants to complete her set. The trade includes Rainbow Dash trading her <em>lucky horseshoe</em> for a crystal chalice; the crystal chalice for an antique chicken statue; the antique chicken statue for a Discord lamp; the Discord lamp for an Orthrus; and finally, the Orthrus, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">along with Fluttershy as a trainer</span>, for the Daring Do first edition book.
</li><li> <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em> was parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>, with completely ridiculous circumstances and consequences like the mouse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">becoming a vampire from drinking too much milk and somehow developing a taste for human blood</a>, turning the family into vampire servants who in turn vampirize the rest of the town, leading to the National Guard coming in and also being turned into vampires, leading to the town, then the whole United States, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the entire world</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">getting nuked</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It all ends up being a woman rationalizing to her son why she stabbed her husband to death.</span>
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has Lisa go on a "take your child to work" day with Homer, but come lunch time she has nothing to eat. Homer starts a series of trades with the last morsel of his own lunch to put together an elaborate salad and place setting for her.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/HerculesTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/HerculesTheAnimatedSeries">Hercules: The Animated Series</a></em> has Phil's island sunk once Poseidon is annoyed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">the loud Bacchanal being thrown there</a>. Herc and Hermes go to Poseidon hoping he can restore the island before Phil comes back from a convention. Poseidon's condition is getting eye lotion from the monster Argus. Who wants a love arrow from Cupid. Who wants some water from the Pool of Forgetfulness to get one of Aphrodite's songs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm">out of his head</a>. Pain and Panic can give the water in return for fireproof shorts, who Hermes knows that Hephaestus can forge as he owes him a favor. And Hephaestus is...giving a lecture at Phil's convention! Herc is found, and flies back with Phil as Hermes goes through the chain, and thankfully he ends just as Herc arrives, preventing him from finding sea instead of an island.

<ul><li> The impracticality of this in large-scale societies is one of the major reasons (the others being transportability and storability - if one item in the chain is a fifty-pound sack of grain, getting it to the next person in the chain could be difficult) for introducing currency<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rz55');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rz55" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rz55');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or currency spontaneously arising in the form of a good accepted as such by custom, like precious metals or salt</span>, as opposed to relying on barter for trade. With barter, you have to find someone who both has something you want and wants something you have in order to make a trade (for example, the shovel-maker may need a new pair of shoes, but the shoemaker doesn't need a shovel), while with currency you only have to do the former because you know almost everyone will want currency. And even if you do find the proper chain, this can also take a great deal of time - a chain of deals with X people in it takes 2X-1 steps to perform (X-1 arrangements for future trades plus X trades), while just paying for something is a one step transaction. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> reviewer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> went into this topic at some length while reviewing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">DS9</a> episode about a Chain of Deals. He pointed out that although the Federation claims to have eliminated money and the need for it, clearly people still have needs or desires that cannot be met except through exchange of goods and services, and that the absence of an accepted currency just makes the whole thing wastefully inefficient and even comical. He also points out an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop">Accidental Aesop</a>: Since Jake has never used money, he has no comprehension of its value, which is why he thoughtlessly badgers his best friend into trading away <em>several years' worth of savings</em> on a baseball card.
</li><li> In the residential housing market, many sale contracts are conditional on the buyer's current home being sold. This means a situation can arise where the sale of a home is dependent on the sale of another home, which is dependent on the sale of another home, etc. making for a very long chain of held up contracts. When the last seller finds a buyer who is not tied to selling a current home, the entire chain of contracts goes through very quickly thereafter.
</li><li> Apartment swaps in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheUSSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheUSSR">USSR</a> were a combination of both of the above. Most people lived in state-owned apartments, and the only way to move to a different neighborhood was to swap apartments with someone else. Of course, this gave rise to situations where someone wants to move from neighborhood A to neighborhood B, and at neighborhood B there is an apartment available for swap but its current tenant wants to move to neighborhood C. To deal with such situations, there arose agencies that built long chains of swaps.
</li><li> As documented on <a class="urllink" href="http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/">One Red Paperclip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in the course of one year (July 2005 to July 2006) Kyle MacDonald negotiated a chain that started with a single red paperclip and ended up with a house — in only <em>fourteen</em> trades! And now he's putting the house up for trade. Someone get this man the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. Incidentally, he borrowed the paperclip back. To bend into an engagement ring to propose to his wife. For the compressed summary of his deals, he traded the paperclip for a fish pen for a doorknob for a barbecue for a generator for an 'instant party' package for a snowmobile for a trip to Yahk for a cube van for a recording contract for a year in Phoenix for an afternoon with Alice Cooper for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> snow globe for a movie role for a house.
<ul><li> The KISS snow globe for a movie role only occurred because the director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CorbinBernsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CorbinBernsen">Corbin Bernsen</a>, is a serious snow globe collector.
</li></ul></li><li> Daisy chain for kidney donors. Someone in need with of a kidney may have a friend willing to donate to him, but who isn't compatible. So the healthy friend signs up to donate a kidney to anyone that needs it if his sick friend receives a kidney. The result can be a complicated Chain of Deals (all thankfully arranged by sophisticated computer algorithms) in which multiple pairs of friends (recipient and incompatible donor) trade kidneys with other pairs until everyone receives a healthy kidney. The longest such daisy chain of such chain involved 11 people receiving kidneys, all from one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist">non-directed donor offering his kidney to whoever needed it starting the chain</a>. In case anyone is interested they can sign up to be start their own chain of kidney deals (and officially become badass) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/anonymousdonation.cfm">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Without getting into specifics, players of any kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame">Collectible Card Game</a> (or, indeed, collectible <em>anything-that-comes-randomly-blind-packed</em> game) have likely committed to a three-or-more-way trade in order to get that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">last card</a> for their precious deck/army/complete expansion set. One of the more entertaining chains is Jonathan Medina's "Pack to Power" chain, wherein he used the contents of a single <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> booster pack to eventually trade for one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Power Nine</a>, basically the most powerful and expensive cards in the game.
</li><li> Interestingly, electrical power systems are often <em>protected</em> by a chain-of-deals-like system. In interlocking, you must satisfy certain conditions in order to operate an item of equipment (disconnectors, earth switches, access gates etc.) which involves following prescribed sequences of opening/closing switches to obtain keys to access other sequences to obtain another key that opens the shutter to the hand crank you need to operate the item of equipment you were interested in the first place. For added super-bonus fun, on offshore windfarms certain steps entail <em>sailing</em> between <em>individual turbines</em>, key clutched in hand. The reason for this intentional complexity is to ensure that all equipment is made safe before anyone gets anywhere near it, and that there is no danger of damaging the main grid.
</li><li> Medieval Trade tended to be an extremely complex chain of IOUs spreading from India to Europe and beyond, known in English as bills of exchange. They're the ancestors of modern checks, and could involve money, but as often as not they just directly involved traders swapping goods.
</li><li> Certain stores offer perks for money spent, such as discounts on fuel from their branded stations. Some will apply this to gift cards and even point out in their commercials that you can use this as a way of getting bonuses on items that you ultimately purchase somewhere else. Naturally, there will be a limit to what stores they offer gift cards for, but if one of those stores happens to carry the gift cards for another store...
</li><li> Hermit crabs will actually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1dnocPQXDQ">form up in a nice orderly line<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when an empty shell is found in order from smallest to largest, and will all "trade-up" as each crab ahead of them vacates their shell for a larger one.
</li><li> Thanks in no small part to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a> in Washington DC, some units the US Military often has to go through such a thing to just get supplies they need, but the bean counters won't let them have directly. This involves one unit contacting another about a part they need for a vehicle or other piece of equipment that broke down, and this ends up with the Quartermaster having to go through a long chain from one unit to another to get the part. On the plus side, this does give the logistians a lot of practice of moving equipment where it's needed. However, this means that units are sometimes illprepared for when they actually go into combat, and the casualties that result. If it weren't for chains like this, many more soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan could've been killed due to a lack body armor for the troops and armor kits for the vehicles.
