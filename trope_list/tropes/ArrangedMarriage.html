</p><p>The way an Arranged Marriage is treated by the plot will be dependent on place and time. For most of human history, arranged marriages were the norm because "marriage" was less about the union of two souls and more about the union of two <em>families</em>. The rise of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a>" ideal didn't really start in Western culture until the 16th century, and there are places on Earth where it still hasn't. Additionally, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriageBeforeRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriageBeforeRomance">Marriage Before Romance</a>" trope often went hand-in-hand with arranged marriages. While the priority is, again, the union of two families, that union is dependent on the stability and comfort of the two people getting married, so the two families would try their best to come up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>. The couple's happiness just wasn't the <em>main</em> goal the way it is in Western marriages today.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>However, the one thing that is almost always present in an arranged marriage is tension. Most people don't really want to marry a total stranger (much less have sex with them), and if that total stranger turns out to be a complete rogue and a cad, it may be necessary for the heroes to spring into action and rescue the hapless member of their group who is being forced to walk down the aisle. (Of course, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>, they'll have to do so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace">the most overblown and dramatic way possible</a>.) Sometimes, the person in the arranged marriage takes matters into their own hands and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance">Runaway Fiancé</a>. The "aggrieved" party may claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreachOfPromiseOfMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreachOfPromiseOfMarriage">Breach of Promise of Marriage</a> in response, as arranged marriages tend to be viewed as legally binding commitments by those who initiate it. Alternately, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>. The character of the suitor is less likely to be important in those cases, but they generally won't look kindly on the outsider's interference.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>(It's worth noting that historically, an arranged marriage would <em>not</em> usually be to a complete stranger as far as most people were concerned. Most marriages took place between families that knew each other well—perhaps as vassal and liege, business partners, or (for the vast majority of the people that weren't merchants or noblemen) simply neighbors and friends. At least in the context of Europe, prospective spouses would have opportunities to interact socially and form an opinion of each other, and their feelings would naturally factor into their parents' thinking on the matter. The modern stereotype did, however, often apply to the political marriages of the royalty and high nobility, where the spouses might not even speak the same language in extreme cases.)
</p><p>Conversely, an Arranged Marriage can be used to lock the hero and heroine together so that their disputes can not end with one of them washing their hands of the other.
</p><p>A common tactic is for the daughter of a wealthy but common family to be matched with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">Impoverished Patrician</a>, for his title: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney">Nobility Marries Money</a>. Occasionally, it's the other way around, with a titled daughter and a moneyed son. Families may even pledge infant children in marriage pacts that cannot be concluded until many years later.
</p><p>Both in fiction and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, royal children (sons as well as daughters) were used as pawns in the political game cementing alliances and peace treaties with their marriages. You might say it was their job to take part in such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>.
</p><p>The Arranged Marriage is not to be confused with: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">Childhood Marriage Promise</a> (whereby a prepubescent couple voluntarily pledges their own non-legally-binding, future troth); a marriage which may arise out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage">convenience</a>; or a marriage that arises from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">some kind of cultural mistake</a>. For clarity's sake, the Arranged Marriage trope will deal only with more binding, traditional types of unions.

This is an odd example, however, in that like the previously mentioned <em>Gankutsuoh</em> example, the engagement is technically broken off (Kaoru left his family after being orphaned and then terribly abused by his grandfather): the series' drama results from the two main characters genuinely falling in love and <em>still wanting</em> to get married, but not being able to do so for the whole scandal it'd bring.

However, she found her last beau is actually no more enthusiastic at their meeting than herself. However, a combination of the boy showing that he is a genuinely kind and charming fellow and the chance meetings with gossipy friends who assume they are engaged puts them in an awkward position as they are both growing to like each other. In response, make a secret pact to stall any wedding plans by pretending to have a <em>long</em> engagement so their friends and family will leave them alone. As it is, the mother admits to her daughter that this was simply a mutual rationalization to allow them both to submit to social expectations while feeling that they have some free choice in the matter since they married in the long run. At this, the young daughter playfully declares she is not going to marry, but become a soldier like her father. The mother humors her about this in the prologue story, but in the series proper, the mother is shocked to learn that her now-adult daughter is now an even more strong-willed, if more quietly defiant, girl than herself who is still serious about following through on that intention and imitating her mother's self-deceptions is <em>not</em> going to be enough for her.

A friend of Carol's had inadvertently gotten engaged to a prince, and while she had the ability to back out, the prince told Carol that he couldn't ascend the throne without getting married and that making men able to marry freely would be one of his first official acts as a ruler. He asks <em>her</em> to marry him, but she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">already has a boyfriend</a>, so she refuses. Ironically, she ends up essentially fighting a duel against another woman for his hand (she enters the duel to protect her friend). She wins, of course, and now that she is essentially engaged to the prince, she uses her new authority to give him the right to marry whomever he wants and recommends that all men be allowed to do the same.

Usually, it takes the form of a Ministry decree that all purebloods must marry a muggle-born, causing either a) Lucius Malfoy to purchase Hermione Granger's contract for his son, or b) Severus Snape to do the same to "save" her from the previous.
<ul><li> Also sometimes used, somewhat more justifiably, for pureblood/pureblood marriages like Lucius and Narcissa's.
<ul><li> One example of this is <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316729/1/Honour_Amongst_Snakes">Honour Amongst Snakes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>.

<ul><li> Some fans tend to believe that the higher class Hobbit families (mainly Brandybuck and Took) marry through arrangements, which is a good way of adding fanfic drama. This belief seems to come from the fact that Merry is an only child, Pippin has three older sisters and no brothers, and only one child of his own (a son), which could suggest that the parents simply get separate bedrooms once an heir has been born. There is, however, no indication in Tolkien's work that this is actually the case.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Sweeney Todd</em> fanfiction (yes, it exists), Benjamin and Lucy Barker are sometimes said to have had an arranged marriage, which is odd as (a) arranged marriages were nearly kaput by the nineteenth century, (b) it seems unlikely that Lucy's parents would aim no higher than a barber, and (c) the way the man who used to be Benjamin remembers Lucy gives every indication of it having been a love match. Of course, the arranged marriage is often used to undermine their marriage in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">Die for Our Ship</a>.

</li><li> Katherine Kerr's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a> Cycle features this for Deverrian nobles. It's extremely significant at several points across the books, although unusually it's presented as neither wholly good or bad. Both male and female characters comment on it, knowing full well that marriages are for political alliances, not love. There's even an in-universe saying about it: "Men like me marry to please our clans, not ourselves."
<ul><li> Some of the arranged marriages turn out rather badly (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maryn &amp; Belyrra, Rhodry &amp; Aedda</span>), while others work out happily <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Blaen of Cwm Pecl considers how lucky he was in his arranged wife at one point</span>.

Ultimately, they come together after the man's landlady formally accepts their marriage, signifying their inclusion into American culture.

As in the film, she's more or less resigned to the whole thing because her true love is dead, but the circumstances and length of the engagement are somewhat different. It's a bit more complex in the book, since in order to be eligible to wed the prince, she has to be made a princess and sent to royalty school. The people have no idea that Buttercup is actually one of their own; they're simply told that Prince Humperdinck is betrothed to "Princess Buttercup of Hammersmith," with Hammersmith being a minor 'lump of land' attached to the kingdom of Florin.

Centuries later Princess Ce'Nedra finds out that she's going to get stuck with the bill, which just came due. In a rather moving explanation, she says essentially, "I'm an Imperial Princess, an asset of the House of Borune. I won't get to choose my husband, I'll be married where I can best serve the House. I've known this all my life." Fortunately, the two kids eventually fall in love anyway.
</li><li> The Belgariad plays with this trope a lot, probably because it focuses on the doings of kings and lords. Large portions of the prequel novel <em>Belgarath the Sorcerer</em> have him running around brokering arranged marriages in accordance with divine plan. But things generally work out for the couples because Destiny grants happiness to people who accept their fate.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R. Martin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> series includes several, as befits a fantasy series with somewhat higher pretensions to historical accuracy than the average. In fact, virtually every marriage between nobles (which the majority of the main characters are) is this trope by definition, although it ranges from finding a son or daughter a good political match that they also approve of, to outright forcing someone to marry.
<ul><li> Traditionally, there is a not-insignificant period of betrothal before marriage, during which the young couple can get to know each other, but in times of war and backstabbing, like the current events of the series, there are quite a few speed-marriages.
</li><li> The first volume devotes much effort to contrasting the marriage of Lord Ned Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully with that of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister; while both were arranged to form political alliances, the former grew to love each other and build one of the least dysfunctional families of the series, while the latter shared a mutually abusive and adulterous relationship. Somewhere in between we find the marriage of Princess Daenerys Targaryen and the barbarian warlord Khal Drogo, which grows from something terrifying if not outright abusive into mutual respect and considerable passion. The series being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">what it is</a>, however, there's a good chance for any relationship to come to an unhappy ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All three men are dead by the end of the first book, for various reasons.</span>
</li><li> The backstory of the series involved a failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> between Lord Robert Baratheon and Lady Lyanna Stark, whose betrothal was derailed when Lyanna was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">kidnapped by and/or ran off with</a> Prince Rhaegar (who broke his own arranged marriage to his wife Elia Martell in the process). The nature of Robert and Lyanna's match is also complicated; Robert believed himself to be genuinely in love with her, but Lyanna doubted they'd be happy together because of his unfaithfulness, and in present day her brother Ned acknowledges that Robert didn't truly know her.
</li><li> Another one in the backstory involved a betrothal between Ned's elder brother Brandon and Catelyn Tully. Sadly, that betrothal failed when Brandon was executed on the orders of the Mad King, which led into the above arranged wartime marriage between Ned and Catelyn.
</li><li> The series itself starts with the betrothal of Lady Sansa (Ned and Catelyn's daughter) and Prince Joffrey (Robert and Cersei's son) to try and "redo" the failed Robert and Lyanna match. Sansa is initially besotted with Joffrey and believes it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>, not realizing Joffrey is a sadistic psychopath. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the time she figures out his true colours <em>and</em> that he's not even Robert's proper son, she's forced to remain betrothed to him while a prisoner at his court in a much darker version of this trope. Ironically, at the same time Sansa's going through this, her sister Arya is on the run with Robert Baratheon's illegitimate but actual biological son Gendry, and they develop a genuine Stark-Baratheon bond in a vastly different way than anyone expected, with an organic friendship and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> totally removed from arrangements between noble houses and without even knowing Gendry is a Baratheon.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey is eventually dissolved and she's forced into <em>different</em> arranged marriage with Tyrion Lannister, a deformed dwarf whose old enough to be her father. (He isn't happy about the situation either.) This marriage actually goes ahead, although thankfully Tyrion doesn't force her to consummate it and is actually one of the kindest people at court.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sansa gets hit with yet <em>another</em> arrangement after escaping King's Landing, and she's betrothed to Harry Hardying, second in line to Lord of the Vale, while masquerading as Petyr Baelish's bastard daughter.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Robb Stark is a speedily-arranged-marriage-due-to-war case, as he agrees to marry one of Lord Frey's daughters in exchange for access to their bridge during his battle campaign. He later breaks the agreement to marry another girl... which leads to the Freys massacring him and most of his family.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As part of the same agreement Arya, his little sister, is promised to Elmar Frey. This is a rather dubious example, however, as Arya is on the run at the time and no one involved in negotiating the match even knows if she's still alive to fulfill the deal. Robb also wryly comments that "Arya won't like that [the marriage] one bit" and her other brother Bran says outright that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">she'll never go along with it</a>. Ironically, Arya (still disguised as a commoner) later runs into her betrothed and is unimpressed by his wallowing over his "lost Princess" and tells him she hopes she dies.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later, most of Westeros believes that Arya has been forced into a - horrifically abusive - arranged marriage with Ramsay Bolton, who has taken over her family's lordship of the North. However, this "Arya" is actually impostor Jeyne Poole, whom the Boltons forced into pretending to be Arya. Arya is yet again unaware of the match, having left the country altogether.</span>
</li><li> Lady Margaery Tyrell is a much more proactive and willing example, as she helps organize multiple arranged marriages for herself - first to Renly Baratheon, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> then to Joffrey Lannister, and finally to his younger brother Tommen - in order to secure her Queenship. She's incredibly pragmatic about the whole thing - including not minding that Renly is gay, Joffrey is sadisticm and Tommen is half her age - and capable of manipulating all three of them. The only problem is they keep dying on her.</span>
</li><li> Princess Myrcella Baratheon and Trystane Martell are a more conventional arranged-as-children case and are given several years to get to know each other when Myrcella is sent to his family court in Dorne. In a miraculously happy example, they actually develop mutual affection for each other and seem happy with the match.
</li><li> It should be noted that <em>any</em> marriage agreement given focus in this series, instigated for any reason whatsoever, will find a path to lead directly to bloodshed. Backing out and sending the other party into a tiff, calling the heirs' legitimacy into question through sneaking around, sitting next to your wife just in time for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> wheel to clunk into place. The only exception is Ned and Catelyn... except for the little fact that Catelyn's other suitor was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Petyr Baelish</a>.
</li><li> It is actually noted in the story that relationships built on love have caused quite a bit of suffering and sorrow for the realm, and even then, you could probably count the amount of love-based relationships on one hand, perhaps two.
</li><li> Variant with the Valyrians prior to the Conquest, where there was a standardised policy of arranging a marriage between...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">the oldest son and daughter of the same family</a>. Aegon the Conqueror tried to have it both ways by marrying his older sister out of duty and his younger out of love, although apart from Maegor I all the Targaryen kings descended from the younger.
</li><li> King Aegon V arranged betrothals for his five children, but all but one broke them off in favor of love matches (one married a commoner, two married <em>each other</em> in defiance of their father's desire to phase out the family incest tradition, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">one just wanted to spend time with his boyfriend</a>). As he himself had been able to marry for love before becoming king (due mostly to having been so far down the line of succession that getting him a politically-advantageous match hadn't been a priority), Aegon reluctantly accepted their choices, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">though it majorly ticked off the noble families to whom he had promised them, impeding the implementation of his reforms and in one case even resulting in a brief rebellion</a>.

Incidentally, it is made clear, after one of Joisan's cousins falls in love with her when she is grown, that while the right of bride refusal exists (so that Joisan could refuse to complete the contract), that exercising such a right invariably brings about a blood feud between the families involved, so in practice it is not used. Joisan is very angry when accused of encouraging the cousin.
</li><li> <em>Year of the Unicorn</em>: the terms of the Were Riders' treaty with the Dalesmen in the Invaders' War was that in exchange for their help, they would receive thirteen brides of noble birth, to be delivered at the beginning of the Year of the Unicorn.

</li><li> Meghan Sayres' <em>Anahita's Woven Riddle</em> is about an Iranian girl who defies a traditional arranged marriage by declaring that she will only marry the one who solves the riddle she weaves in her carpet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The winner is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">first man she meets</a> other than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>.</span>
</li><li> This is played around with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em>, given that the financial future of the Rostovs seems to depend on whom their children marry. There is a short-lived conflict between Nikolai and his parents when he chooses to marry the nice (but technically poor) Sonya, but he had to do a lot of "should I go for personal happiness or the happiness of my family" soul-searching first.
<ul><li> The fact that Nikolai ends up with the wealthy Maria would indicate that he ultimately chose the latter; however, there <em>was</em> an attraction between them from their first meeting, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> portrays him as honestly in love with her. It is of course perfectly possible to fall in love with a 'Good' match.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnaKarenina">Anna Karenina</a></em> plays with this trope. It, much like the Jane Austen books below, was written during a period in which the wealthy were moving from arranged marriages to marriages by choice. It dedicates an entire chapter to the confusion this creates for Kitty's poor mother, as it's unfashionable to flat-out arrange a marriage, but it's lower class to allow her daughter to choose on her own. She has no idea what her role is, and while her situation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (much like that of <em>Pride and Prejudice's</em> Mrs. Bennett), it's at least given some thought.
</li><li> All the female characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MomentInPeking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MomentInPeking">Moment in Peking</a></em> ended up in arranged marriages. Since this was the norm for their time and place, they simply learned to deal with it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede">Patricia C. Wrede</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em>, this pops up twice. First, in <em>Dealing With Dragons</em>, Princess Cimorene's parents try to pawn off their difficult daughter on the braindead Prince Therandil and tell her she has no choice; Cimorene runs away instead. In the next book, <em>Searching for Dragons</em>, King Mendanbar of the Enchanted Forest finds himself eternally arguing with his steward, who pressures him to get married to ensure an heir. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Three guesses who ends up married to whom, and the first two don't count.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede">Patricia C. Wrede</a>'s <em>The Seven Towers</em>, Prince Eltiron's domineering father betroths him to Princess Crystalorn from a neighboring kingdom. Both characters are horrified by the idea, but once they meet and survive the book's plot together, they rapidly slide into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">A Princess of Mars</a></em>, having captured Dejah Thoris, the Jeddak of Zodanga insists on her marrying his son as the price of peace with Helium. Her grandfather rejects it.
</li><li> In Colleen McCullough's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MastersOfRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MastersOfRome">Masters of Rome</a></em> series it is several times explained that elite women are expected to marry where suits their menfolk's interests without complaint. Some of these marriages are disastrous, others work out quite well. Nor are the girl's feelings invariably ignored.
<ul><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>'s reasons for breaking his Julia's engagement to Brutus is he's become aware that she does not love him, and happily she does have a crush on Pompey who's an even better political match. Years later young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Octavius</a> includes his sister's liking for the man on his list of reasons for accepting the suit - admittedly after the political and financial qualifications have been considered.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee">Judge Dee</a></em> series. Though arranged marriages were the rule in Ancient China the Judge encounters a truly amazing number of couples making love matches - sometimes with his assistance. "I'd better resign as a magistrate and set up business as a professional matchmaker!" he grumbles in <em>The Haunted Monastery</em>. In all fairness genuine Chinese literature shows that love matches were not out of the question, providing one had the good sense and good taste to fall in love with a suitable person. This cultural ambiguity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Judge Dee's own household. His marriage to his First Lady was arranged; his marriages to his Second and Third were not.
</li><li> The book <em>Serving Crazy With Curry</em> presents two more modern approaches to this trope- a) the protagonist's older sister asks her parents to arrange a match when she becomes disenchanted with dating (the resulting match is less than successful), and b) the protagonist's grandmother decides to help her by finding some appropriate Indian men to present to her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>'s books are full of references to this trope. The older generation usually sees it as the norm, with the younger generation preferring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> society was undergoing a similar transition at the time.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>: Edward's mother arranges a marriage for him with the rich Miss Morton. He refuses, so he is disowned, and an Arranged Marriage between Miss Morton and his brother Robert is put on the table. The heroine Elinor wonders, to her brother's disbelief, if Miss Morton gets a say in this. Colonel Brandon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> also includes him and his first love being separated by an arranged marriage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>: Lady Catherine claims she and her sister privately arranged a marriage between her daughter Anne and her nephew Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth supposes that this is the reason for Darcy's indifference to Caroline Bingley... until Darcy proposes to <em>her</em> halfway through the book, which makes it clear he doesn't consider himself bound by any such arrangement.
<ul><li> Also from P&amp;P: Mrs. Bennet tries to force Elizabeth to marry Mr. Collins against her will. This is only prevented when Mr. Bennet makes it clear he sides with Elizabeth in disliking Mr. Collins, in one of the best lines in the book:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Bennet</strong>: Very well. We have now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mrs. Bennet</strong>: Yes, or I will never see her again.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Bennet</strong>: An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day, you must be a stranger to one of your parents. - Your mother will never see you again if you do <em>not</em> marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you <em>do.</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> The clash between the old and new attitudes towards this trope is best shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark">Mansfield Park</a></em>: Maria Bertram's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> aunt arranges a marriage for her with the rich but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a> Mr. Rushworth. Her father, although satisfied with the match himself, later offers to break it off in the engagement phase because he can see she doesn't love him; Maria chooses to go through with the loveless arranged marriage. The tragic irony is that Sir Thomas Bertram later (unsuccessfully) tries to convince the heroine, his niece Fanny Price, to marry a man she doesn't love. Guilt and misery ensue for all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoveAndFreindship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoveAndFreindship">Love and Freindship</a></em>, the proposed bridegroom's rejection is a satire.
<div class="indent"><em>My Father, seduced by the false glare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title, insisted on my giving my hand to Lady Dorothea. 'No, never,' exclaimed I. 'Lady Dorothea is lovely and Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know, Sir, that I scorn to marry her in compliance with your Wishes. No! Never shall it be said that I obliged my Father.'</em>

Some characters refer to the main character's marriage with Princess Nina Chavchavadze as this, but note that the couple itself has been in love for quite some time prior to this.
</li><li> The Sandarians in Michael McCollum's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Antares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Antares">Antares</a></em> series practice arranged marriages, befitting a monarchic society like theirs. Crown Prince Philip was betrothed at the age of three. Fortunately, he and his fiancée have fallen in love by this point.

</li><li> Rare non-period Western example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame">The Westing Game</a></em>, Angela Wexler and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Violet Westing</span> are pressured into de facto arranged marriages by their social-climbing mothers, who care more about bagging a son-in-law with an impressive title (doctor or senator) than about their daughters' happiness. Neither bride-to-be copes well with the situation....
<ul><li> Author Ellen Raskin is making a point. The book was written in the early 1970s, and the Violet Westing story took place about 25 years earlier. Back then, women were <em>supposed</em> to care more about the social status, and earning ability, of their prospective husbands, than about companionability or character, although times were changing. This is why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Violet was doomed, but Angela manages to scramble out at the 11th hour</span>. Not to mention that Angela's mother had bucked the system and married for love herself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and didn't think it had turned out so well</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The twelve-year-old Rindi, from the Morris Gleitzman book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bumface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bumface">Bumface</a></em>, is the child of a Middle Eastern ex-pat family living in Australia, who is being heavily pressured into an arranged marriage with a much older man by her family. Much of the plot of the book consists of her and Angus coming up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Schemes</a> to get her out of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> gives an unusual take on this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em>, that also crosses into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl">High-Class Call Girl</a> trope. The Kuat system of planets apparently uses an unusual form of marriage, to prevent inbreeding in the nobility, where middle-class families may choose to raise one of their children as <em>Telbun</em>, where in they receive advanced training in academics, athletics, and social behavior. At the end of the training the Telbun are required to take a retinue of tests to determine their standing in terms of intelligence, health, genetics and social behaviors. The noble families then bid on a Telbun to act as a consort (and servant) for a member of the family. In the event of a child, the Telbun helps raise it, though the Telbun is not considered part of the family himself/herself.
<ul><li> The main reason this crosses into the high class call girl trope is that the Telbun's original family is compensated for the Telbun's services.

</li></ul></li><li> One of the <em>Adventures</em> novellas had one of these be arranged between two groups. Neither one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">happy couple</a> took it well, and instead began spending time on a space station, where they met a mechanic and a woman that lived on the space station. Eventually, following an attempt to take over the station by a Hutt, the two royals both found out that the people they had met on the station were actually alter egos of each other, leading for it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A hilarious example is found in Georgette Heyer's <em>A Lady Of Quality</em>. The lady of the title encounters a young couple whose parents are pressuring them into such a match. The girl, desperate, resolves to run away - with the assistance of the boy! This becomes less peculiar when it is revealed that they have been best friends from childhood, which also explains the total lack of romantic chemistry between them. Never-the-less another character predicts that they will eventually fall in love, once they mature a little and learn to see one another as an attractive man/woman rather than the kid they've known all their lives.
</li><li> Judith, the teenage protagonist of the young adult novel <em>The Minstrel's Tale</em>, is forced into one of these by her stepfather. Not only is she deeply put off by her bridegroom, who is at least thirty years her senior, but on the night of their betrothal dinner she falls in love with the young minstrel who comes to play and sing for them. So she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance">runs away</a>.

<ul><li> Barrayar has an interesting twist on the arranged marriage as, while being most common among the Vor elite, some of its mechanics were in common use among the lower classes as well. In particular, the concept of the Baba, a respected 3rd party that acts as a go-between. Even if the marriage isn't arranged by anyone other than the particulars, the bloke might have his family send a baba to the woman's family, who then asks the woman. It is a kind of crutch for the socially awkward, as the woman doesn't need to reject the man to his face, and the man doesn't have to ask her directly.

</li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Starcraft">Starcraft</a> Ghost: Nova</em> reveals that the Old Families of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Terran Confederacy</a> were, pretty much, aristocracy. Nova's parents had no love for each other and married only because their families wished to merge their fortunes. The marriage contract allowed each partner to have a live-in lover, as long as no children were produced out-of-wedlock. In fact, Nova treated her father's mistress almost like a big sister and she was on good terms with her mother's jig. Other contract clauses include the distribution of power and responsibility. Nova's father is in charge of all business decisions, while his wife controls anything related to the family. Attempts by either party to infringe into the other's "area of influence" is grounds for divorce.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> between ladies, who are expected to be faithful at least until the aforementioned heirs are produced, and young men, for whom mistresses and visits to brothels are winked at, is explored. The main characters, members of the more sexually liberated Heralds, decide that something ought to be done about a culture that raises girls to aspire to no more than a good match.
</li><li> In the first published <em>Valdemar</em> novel, <em>Arrows of the Queen</em>, Talia gets told on her thirteenth birthday by her father's wives that she is old enough for marriage and that one will be arranged for her from the offers her father received. This prompts her to declare that she doesn't want to be married and would rather be a Herald, and then she runs out of the house, to be Chosen shortly after. Later, the Queen has to send Heralds down to the Holderkin to inform them that their kids <em>do</em> have the right to refuse arranged marriages (though such children will be disowned by the Holderkin).

Eldest Whistler does want to be sure that her brother will be happy in whatever marriage he ends up a part of.
</li><li> In Kingsbury's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourtshipRite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourtshipRite">Courtship Rite</a></em>, more-or-less the core of the story is the reluctance of the maran-Kaiel five-family to comply with the arranged marriage to Oelita the Gentle Heretic, ordered by the Kaiel clan's Prime Predictor. The five are in love with another woman, Kathein, and had planned to marry her, so they are outraged by the order, and decide to revive the ancient Death Rite, used to test heretics for their fitness to live, and use that to "court" Oelita. During the course of the rite, though, they start to fall in love with Oelita, complicating matters immensely, especially since Oelita is not exactly feeling wooed by these attempts on her life. Did we mention that everyone except Oelita is a cannibal? It's an odd story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm">The Stone Prince</a></em>, the eponymous prince has been pretty much beaten by his mother into being unable to express his feelings (hence the title), and his only current relationship (which is gay) happens to be one he fought a civil war to preserve when his mother disapproved. By the start of the novel, she thinks it's time for him to get married — to a member of the kingdom's most powerful noble family, which hints at rebellion if their candidate doesn't become his consort. Complicated further by the fact that the bride-to-be's brother is the prince's former lover, the noble family was split down the middle by the prince's rebellion, and the ruler has a nasty habit of slaughtering her enemies.

Her father forcibly takes her back when he regains his wealth and Lyssa once again becomes an option for an arranged marriage.

King Stephen and Queen Anne are involved in a political marriage that fused their long-warring nations together, and they hate each other and are constantly bickering in public. In private, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">they love each other dearly</a>, and use appearances to keep control of the kingdom(s), particularly those courtiers who actually <em>do</em> bear the old hatreds.

However, monogamy is not an expected aspect of the deal. The only real restriction is that Psi Lords are only supposed to procreate as specified by the breeding plan. Otherwise, both male and female Psi Lords indulge in affairs and employ concubines. Takis in general has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture">distinctly relaxed attitude about sexuality</a>, largely driven by the fact that the Psi Lord ruling class has culturally divorced love, marriage, procreation, and sex into different things.

Adolin falls for Shallan's different attitude and refusal to stay away from dirty places or hard tasks, and Shallan loves the fact that Adolin is a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> who doesn't treat her like a fragile toy to be kept safe from danger.

This is exactly what happens when a proposal from the Sovereign House arrives and Aqib marries the Blessèd Femysade, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even though he has to be beaten by the Corporal into agreeing to the marriage</span>.

Either way, her original intended wants nothing more to do with her and so he forces her into another marriage so that he can look like a father sending his daughter off with her husband rather than exiling her.

</li><li> These are a common political tool in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> among the nobility of Westeros. Some are happy, such as Ned and Catelyn, and others are not, such as Robert and Cersei. Many are against the will of one or both parties, such as Daenerys and Drogo or Tyrion and Sansa. The political consequences also make breaking a marriage pact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.
<ul><li> In fact, breaking a marriage pact is what gets Robb Stark murdered as he had an agreement with Lord Frey to marry one of his daughters and breaks the betrothal in "Valar Morghulis" by marrying Talisa Maegyr.
</li><li> Arranged marriages happen to Sansa so often that she's basically pimped out to unconsummated marriages. First, there is Joffrey, which she views as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a> until he shows his true colours. After Joffrey repudiates her, the Tyrells plan to marry Sansa to Loras for her claim to Winterfell. When Tywin finds out, he declares that she shall marry Tyrion instead, which she does, as mentioned above, unwillingly. Tywin orders Tyrion to impregnate Sansa. He chooses not to impregnate her yet, but when she is ready. Seeing as the both of them are soon on the run and neither had bothered to consummate the marriage, no one in Westeros seems to really acknowledge or care as to whether or not she is still married to him. When Tyrion is in serious danger of being executed, Sansa's Aunt Lysa begins to plan a marriage with Robin Arryn. Later, Lord Baelish and Lord Bolton marry her to Ramsay after the bastard is made heir to Winterfell. It goes exactly as one would expect, with him treating her cruelly until she finally snaps and escapes with Theon's help.
</li><li> Fat Walda with Roose Bolton, although he did get to choose which wife he wanted. It was more 'arranged' from her point of view than his. In the books, Fat Walda was actually ecstatic about the arranged marriage, and fully aware that he chose her to get his weight in silver as a dowry - she was outright <em>proud</em> that being overweight actually helped her for once. She knows it wasn't a marriage for love, but few marriages <em>are</em> in Westeros, not even Eddard and Catelyn. The arranged marriage meant that she went from being an overweight and put-upon minor granddaughter of Walder Frey to being the wife of the new ruler of the North, head lady of a new Great House. As a result she is very grateful to Roose. For his part, Roose seems to like her - at least as much as he's capable of "liking" anyone.
</li><li> Cersei with Robert, as mentioned above. She initially saw it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a> up until Robert came to her drunk and called her by his late betrothed's name on their wedding night.
</li><li> Tywin commands Cersei to marry Ser Loras. She's not amused, but this one falls through as Tywin is not there to enforce it, what with his terminal bowel problems.
</li><li> Tommen is betrothed to Margaery after Joffrey's death, and she quickly sneaks into his bedroom to suss him out before Cersei has the chance to alienate the relationship.
</li><li> Daenerys to Khal Drogo, as mentioned above, to secure an army for her brother. Later, she arranges her own second marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq, showing how much she and her circumstances have changed.
</li><li> Stannis Baratheon is in an Arranged Marriage to Selyse of House Florent.
</li><li> Renly Baratheon is in an Arranged Marriage to Margaery Tyrell. An amiable one, although largely sexless for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">obvious reasons</a>.
</li><li> As part of the negotiations that produced the arranged marriage Robb failed to actually have, Catelyn also promised her younger daughter Arya to Walder Frey's son. However, Arya never finds out about this arrangement and with everyone who <em>was</em> aware now dead, it's a moot point.
</li><li> Like Ned Stark, Lord Selwyn Tarth originally planned to marry off his daughter for political advantage. Unlike Ned, he eventually relented and taught her to fight like she wanted.
</li></ul></li><li> Vulcans in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe have a quite complicated marriage arrangement process. This often involves telepathically bonding the intended spouses in childhood, and breaking one's marriage commitment carries dire consequences (especially when one or both of them are in their <em>pon farr</em> mating cycle).
<ul><li> Explored with T'Pol in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, who had to debate whether to enter an arranged marriage which would entail her leaving the ship and returning to Vulcan. Although she refuses, the fourth season episode "Home" shows that her suitor has not given up and T'Pol is required to go through with it, even though she has fallen in love with Trip Tucker by that stage. Her husband divorces her voluntarily however when he realises the marriage is not working - after having already pulled strings to help her overthrow the Vulcan government.
</li><li> Also in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe, Betazoids have arranged marriages; this is explored in the TNG episode "Haven."
</li></ul></li><li> An episode in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em> spoofed the "royals using marriages to form alliances" phenomenon. In one scene, the king calls his elder son Harry to inform him of a marriage he wants to arrange for him. Harry then pulls out a scroll and recites a long list of the women (and one man) he's <em>already</em> engaged to. This episode also spoofed the young ages at which said marriages took place when, in the end of the episode, Edmund is married to a 9 year old princess. The final episode of the third season involved King George III announcing that he wished his son to marry a rosebush. Not just any rosebush; a specific rosebush.
</li><li> The British miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> has the hapless title character, a 48-year-old man, being forced to marry his teenage relative, Messalina. (This is at the behest of Claudius's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilNephew">Evil Nephew</a>, the insane Emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>, who thought it would make for a funny joke.) The marriage seemed happy at first, until Messalina started showing her true gold-digging, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">nymphomaniac</a> colors. She was eventually executed after a failed plot to depose Claudius and make one of her lovers ruler of Rome. As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> is actually based on the real-life Claudius, this is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em>, a man offers his daughter's hand in marriage as a bet in a dim sum poker game.

The marriage was decided on when she was five, and they probably would've let her decline had the Venjix computer virus not nearly wiped out humanity, leaving her parents with only enough money to pretend to be filthy rich until she married someone who was still rich.
<ul><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Juken Sentai Gekiranger</a></em> a couple of years earlier. Ran/GekiYellow is taken to an <em>omiai</em> of the modern variety. Not wanting to break up the team (or lose the only female member in Ken's case) the guys attempt several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">plans</a> that backfire rather spectacularly. The situation is eventually resolved when Ran convinces her mother that her responsibility as GekiYellow is more important.

At the start the engagement is treated very much like a business, with Robert casually giving Joan his grandmother's engagement ring saying that she can have it resized. As the story goes on we see Robert becoming impressed by Joan's intelligence, and later he is shown to be quite kindhearted. It doesn't hurt that the couple can commiserate about not meeting their parents expectations. By the end, with the scandal that follows the affair at the center of the episode, Lady Malmort is resigned to the fact that the deal is dead but Joan clearly isn't going anywhere.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em> Vorenus and Niobe have a discussing with their eldest daughter about arranging a marriage between her and a senator, and she doesn't seem to object. The parents point to themselves as an example of loving married couples, with Niobe adding "strange marriage it would be if you loved them from the start" as if the idea was completely foreign to her.
<ul><li> Season two also has Posca marrying Jocasta, courtesy of Atia's arrangements. Jocasta is upset and cries through the ceremony, but they end up becoming one of the most loving couples in the entire show.
<ul><li> The crying was probably mostly about her entire family having been murdered only slightly before. Not that she was very thrilled about the marriage either, as it was direct result of the aforementioned event.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>, a young, beautiful woman is brought in, who turns out to be a princess of a small island nation, who is desperately trying to get out of an arranged marriage. As she tells Harry, her fiancé is a hulking, ugly, violent brute who is known to eat children. (He thinks she's exaggerating, until she shows him a photograph of the guy; unfortunately, the viewers never see it, and we have to take her word for it.) Unfortunately, Harry isn't able to do anything as far as legalities are concerned, but when he finds out how superstitious their culture is, he's able to teach her a few tricks that make her convince them to annul the arranged marriage herself (and possibly even make advances for women's lib there in the process).
</li><li> Rayyan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleMosqueOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleMosqueOnThePrairie">Little Mosque on the Prairie</a></em> ends up in a traditional arranged marriage by her father. She doesn't mind, though, as she has time to get to know her prospective groom before he proposes, and has the power to call it off at any time. It ends badly, but not because of the arranged part.
</li><li> Divya of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains">Royal Pains</a></em> is drifting towards accepting her arranged marriage to a childhood friend. At the beginning, she tried to call it off, but when the engagement ceremony came around, she couldn't bring herself to do it. However, it's not like she <em>couldn't</em> call it off or she hates the guy (he's kind of clueless and cheerful, actually); she's simply not certain she should be <em>married</em> to him. Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Evan</a> keeps hoping....

This results in a culture that believes weddings should be somber affairs with tears and recrimination, while funerals are joyous affairs. To celebrate a wedding is seen as bad luck.
<ul><li> In fact, when Londo's service pleases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>, the latter offers to grant Londo any request.

The Emperor agrees, but requests that Londo keep one wife to continue his line. In the end, Londo chooses his first wife, the one who hates him and doesn't hide it. Why? Because he knows exactly where he stands with her, while the other two are manipulative liars. What he doesn't realize is that she's the most faithful of them all, having given her blood for a much-needed transfusion that saved his life on the condition that Dr. Franklin keep her identity secret.
</li><li> A first season episode had Vir's cousin and his girlfriend running away to escape arranged marriages. Londo wants to send them back to their families but eventually he breaks down and has his family foster them so they can decide who they marry.

</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> includes a sub-plot where Lester (an Indian Jew) is pressured to marry a girl from his hometown. When he tells it to Big Mike, Big Mike assumes this is because he is Indian. However, Lester's parents are from Saskatchewan, Canada. Apparently, their culture is a mix of Canadian, Jewish, and Indian culture, which is shown when Lester sets up a "traditional" den at the Buy More, which is a mix of both cultures, with Lester himself wearing an Indian robe and a fur hat. The girl is also from a Canadian-Jewish-Indian "Hinjew" family, whose parents are pressuring her to marry Lester. She is initially put off by his "traditional" exhibit, but he reveals that he just did this to impress her. She warms to him a little... until he puts her on the spot and sings to her. Embarrassed, she leaves, calling off the wedding.

The princess whines and complains about it for the whole episode, leading to this bit of marital advice:

<ul><li> There's a reason that royalty is often involved in Arranged Marriage plotlines: For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Western historical examples</a>, you need only read up on European royal houses from the last few centuries. Such tight inbreeding often resulted in diseases like schizophrenia becoming commonplace in such families, not to mention the horror that was known as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.antiquesatoz.com/habsburg/habsburg-jaw.htm">the Hapsburg Chin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> It's also the reason infidelity was so tolerated among men. You had to marry the princess to pump out the required legitimate heirs. What you did outside of business hours wasn't your wife's concern. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">On the other hand</a>, any woman, even one with no enemies, could find herself on the wrong side of an executioner's axe (or could doom her lover to that fate) by having an affair - in some cases, even a merely emotional affair. The logic behind that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> is simple to understand: if the woman had an affair, there could easily be an illegitimate heir, which could have caused problems in theory. In reality, though, an illegitimate heir was often the healthiest thing the queen could provide her husband, and often there was no way to know.
</li></ul></li><li> Arranged marriages were fairly common right up to the 20th century in many western countries and still fairly common in African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries even today. As much as 90% of Indian marriages are still arranged. Expect societal disapproval if you choose your spouse yourself.
<ul><li> If you're rich, then you'll probably be under the most pressure to marry well. A rich person wanting to marry someone poor or even relatively poor would face tremendous amounts of resistance from family. This is true of Indians, but it's also an age-old story that you see across many cultures and time periods, including present-day white Americans. And it may well be true that 90% of Indian marriages are arranged, but that doesn't mean they're all <em>forced</em>. Many arranged marriages are consenting relationships. They're just done for more practical reasons than love because it's expected that you can grow to love just about anyone, so you may as well pick someone suitable and reliable to start with.
</li><li> Dinesh D'Souza describes his sister's 'arranged marriage' as a process by which her parents vetted the prospects and made a shortlist who were then 'invited to dinner with suspicious frequency' and left the final choice of groom to the girl.
</li></ul></li><li> Among certain segments of society, they're still common even in Western countries. For example, Orthodox Jewish couples still largely meet via the services of a matchmaker, though websites such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sawyouatsinai.com">Saw You At Sinai<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are trying to streamline the process. However, only the most conservative Hasidic families still practice the most extreme version of this trope; most will meet via a matchmaker but date for a month or two before deciding whether or not to marry. The combination of formality and desire to marry someone "compatible" has resulted in the infamous "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shidduch">shidduch problem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" amongst Western Orthodox families whereby many singles remain single out of the inability to really find someone they connect to using this system.
</li><li> For members of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church#Sex_and_marriage">Unification Church<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "Moonies," all marriages amongst the flock are arranged by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Myung_Moon">Reverend Moon himself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (or <em>were</em>, until his death in 2012) or the couples' parents.
</li><li> Some very conservative Christian groups practice "betrothal," meaning that they believe fathers have the authority to determine whom their adult children marry via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>.
</li><li> It's also pretty common for good friends who have opposite gender children to refer to them as a future husband and wife, although they're usually joking.
</li><li> Arranged Marriage: Roman style is described by Pliny in one of his letters. He's been asked to look for a suitable husband for a friend's daughter and lists his candidate's qualifications in this order: family background; personal character; career prospects, appearance, and finally fortune which is probably placed last out of piety rather than its real importance. The physical description, interestingly, is clearly included for the girl's benefit.
</li><li> Arranged Marriages are still practiced in South Korea as well, though they are becoming increasingly rare. Matchmakers and parents are usually very careful, though. They will scrutinize and vet a potential suitor for a period (a few weeks to a few years) before allowing the marriage to happen, allowing the couple to date and get to know each other during that period. That way they avoid most of the issues that could happen in arranged marriages of other cultures. Marrying for money is also discouraged.
