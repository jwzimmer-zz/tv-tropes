She then sees their car's fuel gauge indicating they have only traveled about 30 miles which is where the mansion was. The clincher comes when Cooper sees Hauser has the same arm tattoo as one of the masked gunmen.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em>'s Janet pretended to be her sister Natalie. Not only did Natalie's fiance Trevor already suspect this after sleeping with Janet, Janet said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay">something that Trevor had heard Janet say previously</a>.
<ul><li> Janet also hired an actor to play Will, Dixie's dead brother, with the intent of terrorizing Dixie. Dixie feared she was going off the deep end until another character mentioned a run-in with "Will". Suspicious, Dixie went to the cemetery (where "Will" had supposedly been haunting her) and when "Will" appeared, began interrogating him about a nursery rhyme from their childhood. Of course, he couldn't answer. To top it off, when he tried to run, he was confronted by her husband, thus proving himself to be made of flesh and blood rather than a ghost.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em>' Hope was replaced by the evil princess Gina, but her son and husband suspected this immediately, as Gina's demeanor was icy and cruel, in stark contrast to Hope's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>, Mac was replaced by a double who imitated him a little <em>too</em> perfectly. Plus, the imprisoned Mac fed the double false information about his love life, resulting in him ignoring a fiancee he had previously been very loving towards while making advances (which he thought were welcome, but came off as sleazy, thanks to the other woman's lack of interest in him) to another woman. It was then that his friends wised up to what was going on.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a></em>: A recurring theme.
<ul><li> The official explanation for Ian Rider's death was that he was speeding, which Alex knows he would never do.
</li><li> When Blunt visits Parker Roscoe, the young man attributes a Hitler quote to his father. Blunt was a friend of Michael Roscoe's and knows he would never quote Hitler, tipping Blunt off to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> On the CW drama <em>All-American</em>, Asher is one of the usual rich kids of the Beverly Hills school who's talked into throwing a huge party at his mansion. The usually laid-back Asher seems intent on making sure there's not a huge mess and no one touches the expensive car. The car ends up being pushed onto the road where it gets damaged. As everyone leaves, inner-city transfer student Spence comes to Asher, who looks as if his world has ended and relates how he knows the reason Asher is so upset. "There ain't no pictures of your family anywhere in this house. You're always forgetting your wallet. And you let everyone else pay for this party. Ain't that hard to spot someone with no money, man." Asher confesses he was rich but his father lost it all in a bad deal and the mansion belongs to some friend they're staying with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, Thea's boyfriend takes her to a suburban vacation, Thea falling asleep during the ride. She feels something is off when the skies are so bright and clear and the suburb immaculate. However, she soon realizes that the background sounds end up looping with birds chirping and a dog barking in a perfect sequence over and over. It leads her to discover that the "suburb" is an underground chamber set up by HIVE for survivors of the nuclear war they plan to set off.
</li><li> Invoked on the Canadian crime drama <em>Bad Blood</em> as Valentina, the wife of a Montreal mob boss, is being forced to cooporate with the Feds. She covers for a meeting with her handler by telling her husband she's going for a manicure. When the meeting is done, the handler reminds Valentina to get an actual manicure as "the details always matter."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em>: When the police chief wipes his forehead with the wrong hand, this tips off Batman that it's actually the villain False Face in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a> mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> II</em>: Prince Ludwig, master of disguise, tries to sneak into Queen Elizabeth's fancy dress party disguised as Nursie in a cow costume, because Nursie <em>always</em> goes to fancy dress parties as a cow. But he forgot one little thing (or in this case didn't know about it): Nursie is insane and her cow costume looks nothing like a cow. His disguise was too good.
<ul><li> An earlier episode had Blackadder and company trying to impersonate a man who they prematurely executed for a last meeting with his wife, and needing to preempt various threads that she fortunately mentions just before meeting him; they almost stumble at the fact that Blackadder pretends to be missing more arm than the man actually lost, but covers it up by claiming to have gotten in a fight with another prisoner. At the end of the episode, he has to do the same thing with the Queen (who happens to be talking about how unexpected it was that the man was a traitor, considering his various debilities...).
</li><li> ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> Goes Forth". Similarly, Blackadder manages to discover an undercover German agent firstly when George tells him that she had been helping him with the German grammar in a letter to his uncle in Munich, and then later confirms it when she fails to spot that out of Oxford, Cambridge and Hull; one of them is NOT a great university. (As an in-joke, Rowan Atkinson, who plays Blackadder, attended Oxford, whereas Stephen Fry, who plays Melchett, attended Cambridge).
<div class="indent"><strong>General Melchett:</strong> Quite right, Oxford is a complete dump.
</div></li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, Mike is convinced that Henry, a member of a support group, is lying about having a late wife just so he can hang with the group. When friend Anita is dubious, Mike talks of how Henry's tales of meeting wife Judy differ slightly. One story had them sharing their first kiss under the lights of a night game in Wrigley Field in the early '80s. But, as Mike points out, Wrigley Field didn't get lights until 1988. He bets Anita "ten bucks says his next story is different." Sure enough, at the next meeting, Henry tells a story which differs from the one Anita heard before.
</li><li> Happens a lot on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist">The Blacklist</a></em> as either Liz or Red see something is wrong thanks to a small detail.
<ul><li> Red wakes up in Paris hospital, unable to walk with a French inspector telling him he was in a bad accident and that the only way Red is extradited to the U.S. is if he gives up information on Katerina. Red manages to pick the phone of an orderly to find his main screen image has him at a Washington Nationals baseball game. Red then takes a close look at the buildings outside the window and, having been to Paris numerous times, is able to see the skyline is completely wrong for where the hospital is supposed to be. This lets him figure out he's in Annapolis and isn't even paralyzed as this is all a setup to get information out of him.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em>, both Charles and Rosa apply to rent the apartment of an elderly woman who passed away and go to great lengths to butter up the landlord. When he rents to someone else, they start wondering if he has a reason not to rent to <em>cops</em>, because on paper they are very desirable tenants, and find that the woman was poisoned because her apartment was rent-controlled and the landlord wanted to jack up the price.
<ul><li> In the Season 5 Episode <em>99</em>, Jake realizes that Holt has been sabotaging their trip back to New York after a cop mentions that he got a call about a criminal using a "bovine transport unit" to traffick drugs. Jake figures out that it was Holt who called in the tip because anyone else would have just called it a "cattle car." Once Jake figures that out, he comes to the conclusion that every other misfortune that befell them on their trip was also Holt's doing.
</li><li> Holt brings in his old friend, brilliant detective Dillman who prides himself on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> that accuses Jake of a prank in the station. Jake reveals that Dillman was fired from the San Francisco PD because of his arrogant attitude. Jake relates he figured it out when Dillman talked about using a special database for information as routine...unaware no police force has used that system in five years. Even Holt realizes there's no way a supposedly brilliant cop like Dillman could make such a mistake.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>'s eponymous character is rather good at this, considering his eye for detail thanks to approaching every investigation as a novel plot.
<ul><li> Right from the pilot, he recognizes that several crime scenes copied out of his books have details that aren't quite right (the wrong color dress, the wrong species of flower), and since the supposed perpetrator was literally obsessed with him, he would have been incapable of getting the details wrong. Though he then misses the thread (which Beckett easily catches) that the real perpetrator is too ready with an alibi, when he should have had to at least ask for dates.
</li><li> The episode "Once Upon a Crime" has a literal example. A series of murders occur with the women dressed as fairy tale characters and left in public places with the costume bows tied in a certain way. They rescue one woman (Meghan Markle) who was in the same position. However, Beckett and Castle realize the woman's bow was tied in the wrong way and at the wrong angle...as she did it to herself. Which means she's the killer and tried to make herself look like a victim to throw the cops off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Car54WhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Car54WhereAreYou">Car 54, Where Are You?</a></em>: In "Here We Go Again", the plot is <em>started off</em> with this. An old criminal discovers from one of the main characters that the only thing they had done wrong on a heist they pulled many years ago and served jail time for was that they had disguised as police wearing <em>winter</em> uniforms instead of summer uniforms. This set off a funny episode as the criminals pull together their now-aged gang to pull off the heist correctly this time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They pull it off, but are all too weak to pick up the gold bars. They then escape the bank wearing the correct summer police uniforms... from the 1920s, not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDay">Present Day</a> (at the time the episode aired) 1960s uniforms.</span>

Superstar magician Cameron Black is able to see these tricks (a few of which he's used) and helps the FBI in figuring them out.
<ul><li> The pilot has Cameron telling the FBI a plane did not actually explode, citing how an explosion in such an enclosed hanger should have caused far more damage and the details of how it was literally driven away.
</li><li> FBI agent Kay Daniels proves she's good at this too. When a banker for a crime cartel shows up to make a deal, she realizes his suit is Brooks Brothers, not the fancy European suits the man wears and figures out it's Cameron in disguise.
</li><li> That mysterious woman (who set up Cameron's twin brother for manslaughter) calls him and Kay to taunt them on "the game is just beginning" and they have no idea where to look for her.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cameron</strong>: You're in the international terminal at Frankfurt. <em>(woman looks around in shock)</em> I've spent the last year flying around the world, I know every airport has its own acoustics. And Frankfurt pipes in muzak constantly like they're afraid people will forget Beethoven is from Germany. Did you look over your shoulder just now?
</div></li><li> A bomber puts explosives inside a museum room and demands a ransom or he'd blow it up with a young worker. Cameron manages to rescue her with Kay going over the remains of the paintings in the explosion. A major art fan who's been to this museum several times, Kay realizes that the brush strokes in one of the remains isn't right and has it tested to find out the paintings were fakes and the whole thing was a distraction for a theft.
</li><li> Investigating the death of a radio host who ranted on conspiracies, the team are trying to find clues in his apartment. Cameron surprises them by pulling the guy's microwave off the wall to reveal a hidden safe. He relates the guy had once ranted on microwaves being part of a government plot so owning one himself was odd.

Her attention is caught by how all the deeds and checks and such were signed by a woman. As she compares the signatures, Jessica is rocked to see that, while the names change, the handwriting is identical... meaning it's been <em>the same woman</em> all this time. She then sees that the handwriting matches that of Alexandra and thus, as impossible as it seems, Alexandra has been maintaining this property for two hundred years.

But all of their high-tech gadgets and interrogation techniques fail to impress Donna, who immediately spots some <em>actual</em> evidence that proves something is up—namely, an empty binder in the personnel files. She explains that, as a long time "temp" (someone who fills in for office workers when they're ill), she can instantly tell when paperwork is out of sorts. In this case, the binder is supposed to contain a record of employee sick leave...and since it's empty, it proves that no one at ATMOS has <em>ever</em> fallen ill or missed a single day of work.

It turns out Oswin did not escape being made a Dalek, but was able to keep her own mind. All the scenes with her in the escape pod?

One of the humans is asthmatic. Her duplicate inherited the asthma, but not the inhaler, causing both to realize who's who. They keep quiet to allow the peace talks to continue, revealing that the Doctor's plan had worked.

Alexis talks of how she's spent the last decade in Europe but Fallon is convinced she has an ulterior motive. Fallon goes to Alexis' chauffeur for information with the man cagy. Fallon suddenly notes that the windows on his car are a bit dirty and, having grown up rich all her life, knows there's no way a professional chauffeur would allow that to happen. She starts to press him on which hotel he picked up Alexis from, naming a few. When he cites the last one, Fallon snaps that hotel doesn't exist in Atlanta and he's just an Uber driver.

<ul><li> Watson soon joins him in being just as adept finding the minor clues to prove the truth. In fact, thanks to her expertise as a surgeon, Watson can often spot a medical condition clue before Holmes does. Also, as Sherlock isn't as up to date with American sports or pop culture, Watson can see something he missed on a case (for example, how a supposed gambling operation is really a front for smuggling as they're making bets on a "Boston vs Milwaukee game" when no teams of that city play each other in three months).

When a nurse comes in to "check on Mr. Makino" — who the rest of the staff only knew as "John Doe" — Danny knows she's a hitwoman.
<ul><li> Steve and Danny help their old former MI-6 ally Langford in keeping an eye on a flighty British heiress whose mother is an old friend of Langford's. When the girl goes missing, the trio go after him with Langford very intense threatening people to find the girl. They rescue her from a white slavery ring to return her to her grateful Duke and Duchess parents. As they walk off, Danny dryly asks if the girl knows Langford is her real father. While Steve is shocked by that, Danny (a father himself) brings up Langford's behavior and knows that only a dad would go to such lengths. He also brings up how the girl has exactly the same sneaky style Langford did and Langford didn't look happy about the girl hugging her "father." Langford admits it's true but prefers the girl not know.

The suspect, who passed the usual questions about American society and such, told them that he didn't speak any German. They staged a fake fire while the man is sleeping, and as the suspect is waking to the confusion, Kinch, who spoke fluent German, told him to go out of the window, which was located across the room. When the suspect immediately went there and started to try to get out, the men knew he was a spy.
<ul><li> Another episode had a spy inserted by Major Hochstetter that averted most of the blunders that other infiltrators in the series usually commit: he knew the correct codephrase, didn't fall for any bluffs, was up to date on minute details of Americana, had an impeccable cover story and had trained himself not to respond to German. The ruse is only exposed when, during a visit by Hochstetter to Stalag 13, Hogan sees one of the Major's SS goons snap to attention as the spy passes by, as they are trained to do for SS officers but would never have done for a POW, regardless of rank.

In the "Who Can Be Obese Longer?" competition Kenny uses extensive prosthetic makeup to make himself look like a fat person. What this lets him do is remove the extra weight they're forced to wear without Spenny noticing. After a while Kenny comes home and Spenny notices something: Kenny lost the top of his index finger as a child, yet Kenny in the fat suit has it. Spenny concludes that Kenny is faking and uses some spy equipment to see that Kenny is in his room playing video games without his weights on. Spenny confronts "Kenny" and takes off his weight. Then the subversion kicks in: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenny had a prosthetic finger applied when he was getting the fat makeup put on because he knew Spenny would notice it. Kenny revealed himself to be the real deal and to still be wearing the weights (he put them back on) and won the competition. The "Kenny" in his room was someone made up to look like him.</span>

<ul><li> Zeph is among other RAC recruits taking part in a mission where a deadly toxin starts affecting everyone. She manages to blow out an airlock as she's figured out this was all part of a simulation. She explains that the toxin seemed to affect everyone equally when the varying body chemistries and sizes should have made differences. She also noted the lack of sweat on D'avin and how he didn't seem too concerned when Dutch was facing death.
</li><li> In season 5, everyone has had their memories wiped and put in new lives. Despite this, Zeph is able to sense something is wrong as this supposedly semi-arid moon rains exactly twice a day like clockwork. This leads her to figure out the entire place is an artificial world whose environment is collapsing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> occasionally has the lawyers look at the defense counsel's witness list, and realize that expected witnesses are missing. Upon talking to said not-witnesses, they usually find something that would've sunk the defense's case. And it does. The detectives occasionally pick up on stuff like this too.
<ul><li> An episode of SVU had the detectives realizing that their murder victim was in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">alive and masquerading as her own twin</a> after running her dental records; the teeth on the body are structurally identical to the victim, but the victim had some dental work that wasn't showing up. Her husband never suspected, but when questioned by the detectives, realizes that three years prior (when the victim presumably disappeared) that his "wife" suddenly stopped going to church whereas she had previously gone every day and claimed to have misplaced her crucifix, which had in fact been buried with the victim.
</li><li> In one episode of SVU, two girls who helped their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> clique leader murder their friend are trying to claim they only went along because they were afraid of her. The argument is convincing and Novak is worried the jury might buy it, until one of the girls makes a comment on the stand about being chosen to lure the victim out of her house because it was her birthday. Novak then realizes the girl just said her birthday was the victim's date of death, in January, but she's wearing a class ring with a sapphire, the birthstone for September. What's more, the victim had had a September birthday, and also had a sapphire class ring that was never found. Novak absolutely hammers the girl on it (if she was only a forced participant, why would she steal off the body?) until the two defendants start turning on each other to protect themselves. Both are found guilty.
</li><li> Another episode of SVU is about a music teacher who happens to have a popular kids show, where he discovers who is talanted enough to compete for a music deal. It establishes that he is a gay man, and is accused of molesting little boys when one in his class comes forward, along with his friend, and both claiming his favorite molesting spot is the boy's bathroom at school or his music room. Soon, many other boys come forward and it looks like a big scandal is happening. The teacher is fired from both his jobs, some of his family disowns him and he is charged for multiple underage rapes. However, Detective Rollins has doubts from the beginning based on a gut feeling. Sure enough, when she is able to talk to the boy alone in the bathroom at his house, she discovers that the same description he used for the school bathroom is the same one at his house. Rollins gets Benson who was interviewing his older sister, and the two soon discover that the boy was lying all along and his older sister and her friend put him up to it as part of a revenge scheme, because the music teacher rejected them years ago from the competition. The charges against the music teacher are cleared, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">but his reputation is still ruined, and the prosecutor refuses to charge the girls responsible with committing any crimes.</a>

Cut to her walking up to Nate's van and demanding an explanation.
<ul><li> She screwed with Nate's head a little bit first. Justifiably.
</li><li> In another episode, Nate figures out that his long-time rival Sterling is the real father of a girl when he keeps insisting on correcting anyone who calls her stepfather her "father". In addition, the girl is a master chess player and claims her dad taught her, except her stepfather is awful at chess.

Of course, it often turns out that the team left loose threads to be spotted on purpose, to trick their opponents into thinking that they know what's going on. The episode "The Mind of Stefan Miklos" has the whole point of their plan be that Miklos spots the threads and draws a conclusion based on it. The hilarious part is the conclusion Miklos draws is the conclusion they want; their bug transmits Miklos admiring the brilliance of the man who came up with the scheme -and <em>pitying him for failing</em>.

Laura and her ex-husband Jake go undercover as a couple where the doctor shows an ultrasound of Laura pregnant. As the two aren't together (and Laura hasn't been with a man in months), they know it's a fake and figure the clinic is scamming women by making them think they're pregnant, charging them for expensive treatments, then a drug that replicates a miscarriage. Eventually, Laura finds the killer to have been a husband whose wife had undergone several of these fake "pregnancies". He reveals he figured it out as he's a film editor and on the third go-around, realized the "ultrasound" was the exact same footage as the previous two times.

Unfortunately, the partner's death wasn't public knowledge, so the drug dealer quickly realizes the only place he could have gotten that information was by having talked to law enforcement.

D.D. realizes what's going on when she sees a photo from Jack's "vacation" where he was on a resort on the east side of Puerto Rico. Problem being, the background shows the sun setting over the ocean, which is the west. Thus, the "vacation" was all in Jack's mind as he was brainwashed with an alternate identity of a killer.

<ul><li> Played straight in "Datalore", when Lore tries to pass himself off as Data and slips up by mentioning his "off switch". Data had previously sworn Dr. Crusher to secrecy over it. Other smaller things, such as his use of contractions (whereas Data does not) tipped them off to the charade.
</li><li> "Future Imperfect" has a double example. First, Riker is in a simulation designed to make him think that it's 16 years in the future, and he's a widowed single father serving as the new Captain of the <em>Enterprise</em>. Things seem off, but he isn't able to <em>prove</em> that it's a simulation until he sees a picture of his dead "wife" Min Riker. Turns out that "Min" is actually "Minuet", an artificially created woman from a holodeck simulation; the aliens scanned his mind for memories of a woman that he loved, but didn't bother to verify whether she was a real person. <br/><br/>After that, the deception is "revealed" to be a Romulan simulation. But then a young boy imprisoned by the Romulans (who previously appeared as Riker's "son" Jean-Luc) refers to one of his Romulan captors as an "Ambassador"; he's actually a commander, and only appeared as an ambassador in the simulation—which the boy couldn't possibly have known. It turns out that the Romulan prison is <em>also</em> a simulation, and the boy was responsible for the simulations all along; he's a lonely orphaned alien who wanted to convince Riker to spend time with him. In the end, Riker takes him back to the <em>Enterprise</em> so he doesn't have to be alone anymore.
</li><li> In "Ship in a Bottle", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction">Holodeck Malfunction</a> that causes handedness to flip serves as the crucial clue to figuring out what Moriarty is up to.
</li><li> In "Inheritance", when Data meets his "mother", Dr. Julianna Tainer, the scientist who co-built him, he is pleased. When a cave-in occurs, Julianna is revealed to actually be an android (the real Julianna died years before and her husband uploaded her brain patterns into an android without her knowledge), which Data knew. He tells Riker his attention was caught by Julianna doing complicated math equations on the spot. He then saw that her blinking was the same pattern as Data's own, a formula that made their blinking seem random. The final piece was Data hearing Julianna rehearse for a musical performance then replicate the piece in perfect note and pitch, which was humanly impossible.

Keiko O'Brien becomes suspicious of the recording provided of her husband Miles' death, as the time stamp shows it's late in the day and computer analysis shows that the cup he's drinking from (shortly before an explosion) contains coffee, and she <em>knows</em> her husband never drinks coffee in the afternoon as it keeps him awake at night. Sure enough, the video has been faked, and her husband is rescued. He finally makes it back home, and soon after orders a cup of coffee...in the afternoon.

</li><li> The episode "Inquisition" had Bashir in a series of events that made it look like he was unknowingly betraying the Federation to the Dominion. Just when it looked like all his friends were convinced that the accusations were true, O'Brien swiftly moves his arm out of Bashir's grasp and Bashir knows that he dislocated his shoulder the previous morning. That made him realize that everything around him was just a holodeck simulation.
</li><li> In "Duet", the first clue for Major Kira that the Cardassian war criminal Gul Darhe'el is not who he says he is comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverToldYouMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverToldYouMyName">when he mentions the name of Kira's former resistance cell</a>.

He claims to have seen her name in reports he read in his spare time, which Kira probably would have bought, but the brief doubt had driven them to seek out other evidence that further unraveled the man's story (most notably, Gul Darhe'el had never contracted the rare disease that had drawn Kira's attention to this traveler in the first place). It turns out he's actually Aamin Marritza, a file clerk who worked under Darhe'el, posing as him in an attempt to appease his own conscience and have his people admit what they did to the Bajorans.

<ul><li> In one episode, trying to figure out who stole money from a poker game of rich kids, Veronica stops by one suspect, finding his dad answering the door. When she relates how the kid stole the money, the others are baffled as he lives in the biggest house in town and dropped off by limo at school every day. Veronica says she found it odd the dad was home in the middle of the day in a huge mansion but then figured out that it's because he wasn't the rich guy, he was the butler/driver and the kid has been playing up being rich this whole time.
</li><li> In the season 2 finale, Jackie, shown to be the rich daughter of a baseball star, tells boyfriend Wallace she's going to attend school in Paris. When we see Jackie later, she's working at her mom's diner in Brooklyn as it turns out that she was just the product of a one-night stand and her father only recently acknowledged she was even alive. She's surprised when Veronica calls her there, knowing all along that Jackie was raised by her hard-working single mom. Veronica states she figured it out when Jackie did a stint at the Java Hutt as she took to waitressing far too easily for an East Side debutante who'd never had a job before. Veronica also knew Jackie's GPA was nowhere near high enough to attend a preppy Paris school and she needs to stop Wallace before he flies to France looking for her.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There is a story of a British spy in occupied France during WWII who was exposed after ordering "cafe noir" (black coffee). A local would have known that, with milk being scarce, the "noir" was redundant as that was all there was on offer.
</li><li> There are also many, many cases of German spies being picked up almost immediately after arriving in Britain, largely because the various feuding Nazi organisations' information was woefully out of date. In particular, they never seemed to grasp the intricacies of the British rationing system (for example, trying to pay for meals in <em>restaurants</em> with food ration tickets).
</li><li> There were stories of British spies nearly getting caught for putting spoonfuls of soup straight into their mouths (in parts of France at the time it was customary for women to sip from the side of the spoon) and, of course, forgetting that the French drive on the right side of the road. Similar stories include (in this case, US) spies outed when they switch their fork from the left to right hand to eat, rather than the Continental style which keeps the fork in the left hand.
</li><li> There's a true story about a suspected German spy being questioned for several days. The interrogators had their suspicions, but there was nothing definite, so they let the man go. He blurted out, "Danke..." The story is also told the other way around - an American spy, after days of interrogation, being told in German, "Well, seems you're not a spy after all, you can go" to which they replied - in English - "Thank you!"
</li><li> And another one about two German spies entering a bar in USA and making the following exchange with the bartender:
<div class="indent"><strong>Spy:</strong> Two martinis, please. <br/><strong>Bartender:</strong> Dry? <em>(homophonic to German "drei" - "three")</em> <br/><strong>Spy:</strong> Nein, zwei!
</div></li><li> And another one about German infiltrators during Battle of the Bulge:
<div class="indent"><strong>Spy (at American gas station)</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">Petrol</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman">please</a>!
</div></li><li> Whenever German spies infiltrated the Soviet army, they usually had perfect and impeccable legends, accents and documents. But the staples on their documents were shiny stainless steel — the USSR was still stuck with iron staples, which rusted.
</li><li> Germans-dressed-as-Americans during the Battle of the Bulge were given away due to their forgers correcting an intentional spelling error on the standard GI identity cards.
</li><li> American spies were supposedly outed by the Germans for crossing their legs the American way, by resting their ankle on the opposite knee. Europeans cross their legs by resting the back of one knee over the other.
</li><li> Many a German spy was outed in World War II for failing to comprehend the mind-numbingly complicated British Imperial monetary system. Until 1971, the complex coinage, nonsensical divisions of currency (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OldBritishMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OldBritishMoney">240 pennies to a pound, quarters of pennies, etc.</a>), and the numerous slang terms for the various denominations meant that merely counting change was extremely difficult for foreigners. This also nearly tripped up a <em>sympathetic</em> spy, Juan Pujol Garcia, a Spaniard who took it upon himself to feed false information to the Germans (and who was later inducted into the British spy network). Instead of trying to add up the totals on the fake expense accounts from his fake agents in the UK, he simply sent out itemized lists of things (like information) they had supposedly bought.
<ul><li> One of Pujol's fake reports claimed that in Glasgow (which Pujol never visited, being based in Lisbon during this time) there were men who "will do anything for a liter of wine". Not only do Scots mostly drink ale or whisky, they use the Imperial system of measurements, not the Metric. Somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">the Nazis never noticed this</a>. (Then again, selling wine in metric measurements is quite common, even in the US.)
</li></ul></li><li> Legend has it that the "Romeo" spies used by East German spymaster Markus Wolf to prey on lonely West German women who had access to relevant information eventually got compromised by German train conductors who noticed their totally unfashionable haircuts as soon as they entered West Germany.
</li><li> Roger Bushell, the mastermind behind the famous WWII "Great Escape", and his traveling companion were captured in this way. The pair were pretending to be French, but an officer became suspicious and fired off a sudden question in English. Bushell's companion (who was actually from France and spoke French as his first language, but had grown accustomed to speaking English with his fellow POWs in the camp) instinctively responded in English as well. A fictionalized but relatively close version of the incident is depicted in the film version of the story (see entry under "Film").
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">Shibboleths<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are words that rely heavily on language-specific pronunciation. These have often been used to distinguish infiltrators from native speakers. Of course, they are useless against traitors.
<ul><li> The Dutch used the name of the port town Scheveningen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17fkc');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17fkc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17fkc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "Sch" in Dutch is analyzed as the letter "s" and the digraph "ch", producing the consonant cluster [sx], while in German it is analyzed as the trigraph "sch," pronounced [ʃ]</span> to unmask Germans.
</li><li> In 1302, during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges_Matins_%28history%29">Bruges Matins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the Flemish used the phrase "Schild en Vriend" ("Shield and friend") to identify and murder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">French sympathizers.</a>
</li><li> In 1312, soldiers of the Polish duke (later king) Władysław Łokietek rooted out foreign members of a burgher revolt in Kraków by forcing every interrogated citizen to say "soczewica koło miele młyn" - a nonsensical <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2i4dp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2i4dp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2i4dp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>lentil wheel mills mill</em></span> string of Polish words, which were difficult to pronounce properly in fast succession by anyone not intimately familiar with the language. The city was summarily punished for the revolt anyway, but the foreigners identified this way received some extra attention.
</li><li> The term itself comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, in an account where, during a conflict between the Gileadites and Ephraimites in one of Israel's pre-monarchy civil wars, the Gileadites identified fleeing Ephraimites by their pronunciation of the word <em>shibbólet</em> (שִׁבֹּלֶת) (meaning "ear" in the sense of "ear of corn," i.e. "the part of a cereal plant that contains the grains"), which would have been pronounced <em>sibbolet</em> in the Ephraimite dialect.
</li></ul></li><li> Another WWII story tells of a soldier who tried very hard to pass as a civilian while in Europe. He got new clothes, new hairstyle, learned the local language, etc. One day, while waiting on the curb with two bags of groceries in his hand, a German walks up and basically greets him with "Hi, Soldier!" The reason? He had two bags of groceries in one hand, because the military ingrains the habit of keeping your other hand free to salute.
</li><li> During WWII, German spies would often try to infiltrate Britain via neutral Spain, posing as Swiss businessmen in order to travel to Spain. The problem was, German standards of discipline were <em>too</em> high. German spies were under standing orders to stay sober, not frequent brothels, and absolutely not to deal on the black market, whereas given how expensive and heavily taxed cigarettes, saccharine and other luxuries had become in Switzerland during World War Two, MI6 could tell with a good degree of accuracy who were real Swiss businessmen and who were spies simply by offering to sell them some cigarettes or nylons on the sly. At one point, the German intelligence services were receiving hundreds of reports from agents in London per month, all coming from agents caught and turned in Spain, writing fake reports from Barcelona using "The A-Z of London" and copies of <em>The Times</em> to keep their fake reports realistic. All because the spies were <em>more honest</em> in their dealings than the civilians.
</li><li> More hapless German and Russian spies in and after WWII ran into trouble when, if they made it to England, they ordered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">tea without milk whilst posing as working-class Brits.</a> That would be seen as a little odd today. In the '40s and '50s, you may as well have turned up with a sandwich board saying Im a spy.
</li><li> An interview with early female CIA operatives suggested that women at the CIA were better at this than men. One now senior analyst stated "You could always tell them by their socks." Another pointed out that regular Russian embassy employees always had cheap shoes, but the intelligence agents had very nice shoes.
</li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (in tandem with what appears to be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a> or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a>) in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>-era joke:

He quickly gets rid of the parachute, dons local garment and starts to wade through the snow. After a lengthy march he finds a lonely hut, knocks at the door, and is allowed to enter by an elderly lady living in it. She invites him for a snack, and after some time asks: <br/><strong>Lady:</strong> You're an American, aren't you? <br/><strong>Spy:</strong> But Granny <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bbdt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bbdt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bbdt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an affectionate way a Russian may refer to an old woman</span>, how could you?!

</div></li><li> This is how the Allies spotted Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazi General in the SS.</a> Kaltenbrunner gave himself up claiming to be a doctor and offering a false name. However, his mistress spotted him, and by chance occurrence, she called out his name and rushed to hug him. On 12 May 1945, this action tipped off the Allied troops, resulting in his capture, trial, and execution.
</li><li> There are quite a few videos on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyVeteran">Phony Veterans</a> like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOj07ClhEi8">this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> getting called out by actual soldiers for claiming to be part of nonexistent battalions or wearing medals improperly.
</li><li> The English highwayman Dick Turpin was reportedly caught this way after fleeing to Yorkshire and changing his name. Dick wrote a letter to his family, but he'd been taught to write by a postman. So when that postman received the letter and realised 'John Palmer' had exactly the same handwriting as a notorious armed robber, the trail lead back to Dick and he was arrested and executed.
