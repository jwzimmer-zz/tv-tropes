</div></div><p>Human psychology involves many moving parts. Of these parts, the actual "issues" are merely one of them. Whether one has multiple issues — psychological, some biological, some cognitive, and some related to experiences and memories — or singular issues — these issues, by themselves, are not always determinants or agents of human behavior. It very much depends on the patient. Whether these "issues" are problems is also not clear, since sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">Misery Builds Character</a> and psychological neurosis at times manifests as a coping mechanism to difficulties in a society, and merely adjusting to society without taking into account what the values of that society are and whether it's worth adjusting to, makes psychological treatment very difficult and almost always a person-to-person situation.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Overcoming psychological problems takes lots of time, effort, and sometimes medication. While finding the source of the problem is important to helping a mentally ill patient, it is only part of the process, seeing as it simply allows the psychiatrist to get an understanding of just what <em>is</em> wrong. Once the source of the problem is found and they understand how the mind has been affected by whatever causes, it makes it easier to work out the proper methods and/or medication necessary to help the patient overcome it. And even then patients often regress, or rather they inevitably do regress since where fiction allows the illusion of an ending where a character surmounts a problem and achieves permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, in real-life, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud">Sigmund Freud</a> pointed out memorably, every part of human consciousness rests side-by-side at all times, and while people do change and grow, they never entirely sever continuity with who they once were. There is much repetition, much regression to earlier habits that people believed they had kicked apart. And the frequency with which, and the reasons why people repeat or regress often, and whether they are self-aware about these occurrences, often says more about the character and individual than their actual issues ever do.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fiction, to serve the demands of narrative, i.e. telling a complete story with a beginning-middle-end and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, these things are flattened out. Psychological therapy and its tropes mirror narrative in many ways, it involves a plot to find some mystery, to tie together disparate parts into a coherent whole. So this feeds into storytelling easily, as well as creating story-arc and character-arc, it's a handy way of creating a distinct ensemble that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">sticks out to readers</a>, simply give different characters different issues and have them grow and change by identifying and then overcoming those problems. In story terms, finding out the dark secret of the past, serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, what it is specifically, is not important to the plot, but finding it out is the goal to be attained. Used this schematically, single-issue-psychology comes off as especially trivial. It's much easier when all a person's problems stem from a single traumatic incident, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy">working through that single incident will instantly cure them</a>, so fiction tends to represent character psychology in this way, especially genre fiction where much of the story is about an external plot and not character. In a plot, using such a trope explains the character to the audience, allows the latter to empathize with the main character, and likewise the action of the plot becomes emotionally resonant since audiences are aware of how it directly affects the character in his inner being. Realistic drama, character studies, and serious fiction will likely avert or complicate this; whereas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction-oriented</a> stories will heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subvert</a> and at times mock this concept.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Remember, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, as it serves a purposes in condensing a character's personality for the sake of run time and comprehensibility. If psychological healing were played with 100% complexity, certain mediums couldn't manage to deliver it in time. Movies, for example, have time limits of about 2-3 hours maximum, and it would be impossible to cram that much detail into the story without risking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords">Eight Deadly Words</a>. Likewise, having a single issue by itself does not mean that a character is one-dimensional, if a story uses a single issue as a means and not an end, it's on solid ground. Going too far in the other direction, i.e. giving the character multiple issues risks beggaring disbelief in the audience that an individual with that much baggage could actually be functional, and simply making everything about a character an "issue" is just as trivializing and misapplying psychology as single-issues can be at their most banal.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em>, Chiaki is unable to pursue his dream of becoming a world-class conductor because an incident in his childhood (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">watching a man die while their plane was crashing at the age of 10</span>) gave him a phobia of flying.

</li><li> Rosemarine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta">Kaze to Ki no Uta</a></em> would have been more stable if he hadn't been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raped by Auguste.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em> relies heavily on this trope. Nearly all of the students (and several of the other teachers) have incredibly hostile personalities, but once Onizuka finds out about the traumatic event in their pasts, one dramatic example is usually enough to at least tone them down, although many continue to struggle with their old problems throughout the series, or acquire new ones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Despite the page quote, the situation with Asuka is a bit more complicated. Most of her mental issues reach back to her mother going insane and subsequently killing herself, fact, but it is evident that she had problems beyond that. It's mentioned that her mother neglected Asuka even before her illness, and the rest of her childhood was apparently pretty bad too: her relationships with her father and stepmother seem to be horrible (in the flashback to the hanging scene, she mentions that she 'doesn't have a papa') and completely loveless respectively. She lumps them both in as people she <em>hates</em>. Hearing her father and future stepmother going at it at the hospital probably contributed to her unhealthy attitude toward sex as well.
</li><li> Half the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> fit this trope pretty well. Not so much in the "one trauma" thing- that is there, but they are usually well aware of it. Rather, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> way, in that their trauma tends to inform their philosophy of life and fighting, which is why Naruto (or whoever they are facing) can't defeat or understand them. It's more like they are shocked that people can have as bad or worse lives than they had, but <em>not</em> be a psychological trainwreck.
<ul><li> Though the big one, Sasuke, averts it. He's had to confront his issues repeatedly over the course of the series but, while he made progress a few times, they still continued to haunt and drive him, plus each time he looked like he was getting better, something came along that screwed it all up. He's crazier than ever, and <em>after</em> dealing with the source of his troubles (albeit in a fight to the death). In Part 1, Kakashi actually warned him that he wouldn't be able to play this trope straight, since he'd seen too many people like Sasuke who let revenge consume their lives, even after they had achieved it because their issues by then had grown beyond the initial trauma.
</li><li> Naruto, as well, since though he had, as he put it, been "saved" from his depressingly lonely childhood and the neuroses that went with it early on in the story, it was only the worst of it that was over, and he spent much of the rest of the story gradually overcoming them, as well as constantly running into situations that brought back his painful memories.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> with Gaara. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship">Defeat Equals Friendship</a> and sanity are in play after his fights with Sasuke and Naruto brought his issues to the fore, but while he's cured surprisingly easily of being a deranged and psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, and is now closer to his family and has friends, he is still emotionally withdrawn and obviously has some progress to make.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters">Little Busters!</a></em> anime ended up explaining Riki's narcolepsy this way - in the final episode, Riki realizes that he falls asleep like that as a response to any bad things happening so that he can run away from them rather than confront them directly. In the visual novel, this wasn't so, as Riki's narcolepsy was just a condition he happened to have that affected some but not most areas of his life, like in reality. Though at least, as he's shown waking up at school in one of the final scenes, the anime may not have intended to claim that coming to terms with the event 'cured' him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Homunculus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Homunculus">Homunculus</a></em> has this as a general premise, since the Homunculi themselves often take a form that represents each person's deepest insecurity. When time comes to resolve the person's issue, the Homunculus will usually break down and become more normal-looking until the person looks more like themselves again.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Superhero origin stories often revolve around a single inciting incident:
<ul><li> Batman's life, obsession, and psyche hinges on the night his parents were killed in front of him and his desire to overcompensate and overcome the helplessness of being a small, vulnerable child seeing his protectors brutally mown down in the blink of an eye. Later events (the death of the second Robin, nearly shooting Alexander Luthor, being cast through time by a mad god) merely add nuance to his behavior, although as time goes on, people note that Batman's general paranoia, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> secretive tendencies (which he unleashes not only on villains but his allies and friends: the Batfamily, Justice League, etc.) and his inability to really mature and be a man (i.e. form a meaningful relationship and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">not be attracted to</a> villainesses), as well as the fact that he <em>dresses up as a giant bat</em> and takes his legend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> seriously, means that there are parts to him that aren't entirely conditioned or based on what happened to his parents.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX">Punisher one-shot story</a> complicates this. Most people believe everything Frank Castle does is due to his family's death, while journalists, authors, psychologists and other researchers look into his history and pin it on Vietnam. In actuality, The Punisher didn't spring from any one event, his issues built cumulatively and not just from traumatic events either. Reading "The Tyger" in a poetry group inspired a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">fascination</a> with the greatest killers in the animal kingdom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s</em> obsession with being a superhero stems entirely from his guilt over letting a robber get away who wound up killing his father-figure Uncle Ben. He consistently reminds himself that <em>the one time</em> he ignored his "responsibility", it cost him his father figure, and he resolves to use his powers to help others even if it costs him socially. More realistically than Batman, the comics and the live-action films repeatedly show that this by itself doesn't entirely transform Peter overnight since he can't feasibly devote himself full-time to being a superhero and that he often has to negotiate different parts of his social and professional duties, often trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictingLoyalty">Cornelian dilemma.</a>
</li><li> About halfway through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>'s legendary run writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>, psychologist Doc Samson sits down with Bruce Banner (and a hypnotist), and tries to work through Banner's issues, particularly his multiple personality disorder. A few hours later, they've covered his abusive childhood and the death of his mother, and suddenly all the personalities are integrated, presto-change-o, and we have a new Hulk, who doesn't transform back into Banner. Lampshaded, in that Samson repeatedly mentions how most people need years of therapy, and there's no way it could have been that simple. (It wasn't.) There are suggestions it <em>might</em> have taken hold if Hulk didn't keep brushing off Samson's follow-up sessions due to superhero business.
</li></ul></li><li> For the first fifty or so issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em>, Obsidian was portrayed as a threat to himself and others and as suffering from symptoms superficially akin to schizophrenia. This culminated in his attempt to destroy the world, which was thwarted by his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> speech. Obsidian hasn't been in any need of treatment since then, judging by subsequent appearances: apparently, working through his daddy issues was enough to entirely cure him. In this case, the "voice" he was hearing was, in fact, genuinely another entity, making it less "paranoid schizophrenia" and more "daddy issues and receiving a metric tonne of malicious advice". It would still probably be more complicated than it was portrayed to resolve, but it's not <em>quite</em> as bad as curing schizophrenia. Also, in a recent issue, one of his teammates worried aloud if had stopped taking his medication when he began to act strangely, suggesting that when not medicated his problems may return.
</li><li> Comic book supervillains, especially the really popular ones are a rich source of in-universe and out-universe debate on their motivations. The actual answers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a>) are obvious but much of the work is to create that illusion of consistency:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>'s motivation for his hatred for Reed Richards stems from the fact that he ignored Reed's warnings about an experiment, said experiment backfired and gave him a scar and got him expelled. Said scar is the reason why he wears the mask and armour look. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s views, the scar is actually a thin cut that Doom exaggerates out of proportion, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a> argues that the scar may have been thin but Doom overcompensated by putting a hot iron forged mask on his face truly twisting his features. Of course, the true reason for the rivalry between these two intellectual rivals is made more complex and entangled as time goes on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> was originally a jackass in purple tights before made into a complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> who gave him the powerful and compelling backstory of being a Jewish holocaust survivor, which coupled with other tragedies convinced him that humanity was fundamentally bigoted and would not truly help mutants and that only radical action works to protect the mutant group.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> invented the proverbial "one bad day" concept, where the Joker tries to prove that a single instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> can drive anyone insane, demonstrating it with the psychological and physical torture of Commissioner Gordon. It doesn't work on Gordon who despite being traumatized insists that Batman bring him to justice by-the-book. Psychologically speaking, Joker's literal approach i.e. spelling out exactly why he is doing and the purpose he wants to achieve on his victim is not conducive to creating the effect he wants and hence it's fairly easy for Gordon to resist. At the end of the story Batman tells Joker that his "one bad day" theory is bunk, that Joker is mentally ill, and while something bad may or may not have happened to him, Joker still has agency and culpability to try and cure himself. Joker briefly realizes this and decides that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">he won't get better after all</a>, and Batman himself laments that not only will Joker turn down his offer of help, but that he himself won't kill Joker for the greater good since he doesn't believe himself to be sane to handle the responsibility of killing someone on his conscience. This part of Joker's characterization recurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, but the Joker does it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harvey Dent</span> this time, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it works, resulting in Two-Face, mostly because Joker disguises it better, comes to Dent when he is alone and bitter with his co-workers and by use of the coin flip, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">gaslights</a> Harvey into thinking that it is his decision</span>.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace">Two-Face</a> in the comics, who originally only had his scarring to contribute to his insanity. Eventually, he was given a severely screwed up mentality including issues due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> and problems with rage, which the scarring only pushed into pure insanity. He was also secretly violently schizophrenic, and actually murdered someone (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>) <em>before</em> the scarring.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> (of <em>The Killing Joke</em>, above) actually dislikes this trope or more precisely the way this trope is applied in comics to merely motivate and explain character actions and plot, which in his view makes the characters automatons who are reducible to their neuroses, and therefore not capable of agency and change and he sought to avert this as much as possible in his superhero fiction:
<ul><li> Alan Moore regretted that <em>The Killing Joke</em> became misunderstood for this, and considers it an unsuccessful work, because his application of psychological problems on larger-than-life comic book characters never really worked since the nature of the character and its function was that any complex origin ultimately becomes a single-issue excuse for characterization. In the case of Joker, one-bad-day becomes his rationale for doing horrible things to people because horrible people did horrible things to him, but for him to be a complex villain, Joker must be capable of some amount of change, which doesn't exist as a meaningful choice for him given the nature of the medium and the Batman-Joker rivalry.
</li><li> He averts this most notably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> which initially had superhero stock characters with, on the surface, fairly superficial traits and motivations, but the comics gradually explore their inner life and bring to light hidden parts of their past and in doing so reveals that none of them are truly consistent, not even to their chosen identities and sense of being and all of them are capable of change: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">The Cynic</a> Comedian breaks down in tears and dies a lonely old man regretting some of his bad actions, Dr. Manhattan who has grown aloof from humanity gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a> Aesop, Rorschach poses as a tough guy but dies in tears.</span>
</li><li> All of his stories, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em>, are about giving people a complex sense of identity and inner life. Despite his basic motivations, as a plant-based elemental who initially thought he was human, he meaningfully tries to articulate new reasons to like humanity and nature, and falls in love with a human being, despite his understanding that humans can be disappointing.

<ul><li> Avoided in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terinu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terinu">Terinu</a></em> AU fanfics <em>Grace of God</em> and <em>Spin Recovery</em>. The alternate universe version of Rufus did suffer from a major trauma, but he managed to inflict plenty of lesser ones upon himself in subsequent years, which he still has to attend therapy and take plenty of corrective drugs to deal with.

(Note that Akane was barely older than a toddler when her mother died)</span>. An obsession exacerbated by Ranma's seeming ability to overcome any opponent.
<ul><li> Not quite, they list that as the starting point to her issues, which were built upon by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">throwing herself into martial arts to make herself stronger (and yet never keeping up with Ranma later), her father emotionally abandoning all his daughters, Kuno's organized attacks souring her on men in general, and everyone supporting her unhealthy abuse of Ranma, who she ends up irrationally seeing as a trigger for her anger issues after thinking he tricked her into thinking he was female.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's more than that; Rage disorder, a chemical imbalance that can be as genetic as it is psychological, so maybe she can't help it, which explains why she just gets angrier after the story forces her to confront her issues and false assumptions that only hurt everyone, plus the fact she refuses to get treatment.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Ranma also averts this, his issues stem from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the systematic abuse from his father giving him a strict set of what a man should be, and his own morals and honor that his immoral parent didn't stamp out(probably since his wife would kill him and it makes Ranma easier to control), but more specifically in the fanfic, it comes from everyone blaming his foot in mouth comments for Akane's anger, leading even him to blame himself, no matter how far he goes to avoid angering her. Combined with how much he actually loves her, the fact that defending himself, which he is quite capable of, only makes her look at him with hate that he finds worse than the injuries, this all leads to him becoming highly submissive, depressed, and unemotional as he feels that all of it is his fault for failing the one he loves, and thinking of himself as a failure as a man for all of this coming from a woman on top of the more emotional failings.</span>

</li><li> Mel Brooks' character in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighAnxiety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighAnxiety">High Anxiety</a></em>, arguably a parody of this sort of thing. Arguably taken to the most unrealistically bizarre extreme possible. After spending the entire movie freaking out due to constantly being put into situations that involve extreme heights, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fear was not of heights but of...parents. Cue a flashback to Mel Brooks dressed like a baby superimposed behind two arguing parents, which is apparently the cause for everything. He then immediately gets over his fear of heights with no trouble whatsoever.</span>
</li><li> Surprisingly averted in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnalyzeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnalyzeThis">Analyze This</a></em>. In a wacky comedy about a mobster's analyst, you'd expect there to be one big issue that would, when revealed, leave the mobster miraculously cured. Instead, there is one major trauma — which, when touched upon, opens up a heaving wall of repressed guilt and grief, and renders the mobster an emotional wreck for weeks. After he pulls himself together, he and his analyst agree that, while he's had a breakthrough, he's far from cured and needs a lot more therapy.

The revelation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> and that it symbolizes his lost childhood reveals that Kane at the end of his life, and perhaps for most of his life, never got over his separation from his mother and his happy childhood, that being raised by his bank led to him spending the rest of his life trying (and failing) to win other people's love through superficial means. Welles called this in later interviews, "dollar-book Freud" because he felt that people mistook the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>. Noting the point of the film was that Kane's motivations and actions are mysterious and unknowable, that Rosebud is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">The Greatest Story Never Told</a> and that the last scene which shows the sled being tossed in the fire was meant to suggest that maybe the secret is not important either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SecretBeyondTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SecretBeyondTheDoor">Secret Beyond the Door</a></em> (1948) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang">Fritz Lang</a>, the childhood traumatic event that triggered all the psychological issues for Mark Lamphere (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelRedgrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelRedgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>) was a mistaken belief that his mother had locked him in a room to keep him out of the way when she was going to the theatre with another man.
</li><li> Seen in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em> where Spock's brother, Sybok, has the power to discover everyone's 'one trauma'. It's somewhat shown, however, that Sybock is invoking this trope in-universe and simply using his abilities to make people <em>think</em> they're cured while leaving them with a psychic-induced glow of happiness and self-fulfillment instead of actually dealing with emotional issues in any meaningful way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsAnalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsAnalyst">The President's Analyst</a></em>, the title character gets out of a forced defection to the USSR by getting his KGB captor to realize, in very short order, that he became a spy only out of fear of his father, who had arrested his mother in a Stalin-era purge. He does tell the spy that a cure through analysis is possible but would take years, which he couldn't possibly do if he were bundled off to Russia....
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheConversation">The Conversation</a></em>. Main character Harry Caul avoids his terror over having others harmed by his surveillance work by completely ignoring the consequences of what he does.

In the end, this isn't even the worst of his problems.

He seems to be getting better when he's with his old college friend Alan, but relapses often in the course of the movie. Even when he finally opens up about his issues, it's obvious he still has a very long way to go before he's really cured.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting">Good Will Hunting</a></em>, Will, who has successfully fended off helpful and unhelpful psychotherapy throughout the movie, is cured of all his issues at the end by exchanging graphic memories of their respective abusive childhoods with Sean, then crying as Sean repeatedly tells him, "It's not your fault." It was cited by some critics as the one thing in the movie that seems like it was written by people as young as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LarsAndTheRealGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LarsAndTheRealGirl">Lars and the Real Girl</a></em> partly averts this. Lars's problems are all connected to his childhood and his parents, but there's no single defining event—many negative experiences made him the way he is.
</li><li> Cleverly handled in John Carpenter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWard">The Ward</a></em>. The opening scene involves a seemingly insane young girl burning down a house and then being institutionalized for reasons she does not immediately understand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact she's been there for longer than she realizes. She is suffering from split personality disorder, the other patients are not actually patients but merely her other personalities, and the ghost supposedly killing everyone is actually her true self gradually overcoming her psychological issues.

Moriarty comes to be hated by Holmes either as the bearer of bad news (Freud's version) or because he played some deeper but unknown role in the affair (Watson's version, based on observations of Mycroft Holmes).

In a broader sense, the way downtimers react (in part thanks to Eric Flint's "Middle Man" ideology) can also break a little flow, adapting to monumental changes both social and technological far faster and with better results than many "Middle Man" people can do to things that had barely happened in their own society. It could be explained that since they'd been living in a literal Hell on Earth, it was easier and better to just go "insane" as put by Gretchen, but still it can come as quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">unrealistic</a>, in a human behaviorist kind of way.

When Ray came along and became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">eternal centre of attention</a>, Robert was left to fend for himself and subconsciously began touching his food to his chin the way Mom used to do. This never gets resolved. They just found out why he does it, but he didn't stop (though the audience now had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">one more reason to like him</a>).

And that Single Issue is almost always The War. There is at least one exception: the patient was Hawkeye, and the problem was rooted in a childhood experience in which his cousin pushed him off a boat. It was still a single issue, though. Possibly justified in the cases of most 'victims of the week', since Sidney was mostly just charged with getting a diagnosis so they could get a handle on what to do with the kid in question. Usually the diagnosis was "Send him home, he needs a lot more therapy than we can give him in the middle of a war zone."

Ace lives up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">his name</a>, while our Rimmer is a cowardly, neurotic, bullying, officious, psychological train wreck. We learn that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">difference between them</a> is that one Rimmer undeservingly passed a grade in school, while the other was held back. The subversion is that it's the loser-Rimmer who got the lucky break; Ace got left down a year and learned to stand up for himself as a result. Rimmer's the mess he is today for <em>lack</em> of a single traumatic event.
</li><li> Subverted <em>and</em> played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTenthKingdom">The 10th Kingdom</a></em>: Wolf's issues with food, love, and his animal urges are hilariously sent up in scenes with a New York Jewish psychiatrist, and after only <em>one session</em> (which he later describes to Virginia as "extensive therapy") he suddenly pronounces himself a changed man and produces "the books to prove it," consisting of several titles of real, well-known self-help books. These books make the journey with the heroes and, seemingly after one read-through, manage to correct character flaws and induce positive developments in all the protagonists. On the other hand, the source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Evil Queen</a>'s wicked nature seems to stem from one event: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once it is revealed that she is actually Virginia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousParent">missing mother</a>, Tony then reveals that she attempted to drown Virginia as a little girl because she was 'sick and getting worse and worse', a rather vague statement of mental illness. And it was this instability that made her easy prey for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">Snow White's Wicked Stepmother.</a></span>
<ul><li> To be fair, Wolf as a character acts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a> most of the time, and even after enthusiastically devouring (pardon the pun) the self-help books with all their cliched phrases and pop-psychology he's still half-werewolf and can't entirely control his urges (such as during full moon).

While the character Colbert is clearly <em>very</em> screwed up, the writers introduce new reasons for him to be that way about as often as they introduce new screwups. One fan theory is that the character is exhibiting symptoms of PTSD: again, from a whole bucket of different traumas, ranging from his abusive parents to his repressed homosexuality. Either way, he's clearly not going to be 'fixed' any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jack gets Tracy an appointment with the staff therapist to deal with Tracy's combative attitude. Over the therapist's objection, the two start up a role-playing session with Jack playing Tracy's dad, mom, the upstairs neighbor, Tracy himself, the man his mom ran off with (in a rapid-fire stream of comical impersonations)...and within a minute Tracy is weeping and cured...of his compulsion to transgress, anyway. He's still a complete madman otherwise.
</li><li> Jack helps Liz realize that her sexual issues stem from a childhood trauma involving rollerblades and a Tom Jones poster. While the trope is specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a> in that he assures her she'll still need years of therapy, they do realize that she can function much better if she avoids Tom Jones posters.

The main character goes crazy for a while after his fiancee cheats on him with his director, but years later (after that specific trauma has been dealt with) he is still experiencing unpredictable mood swings and the like.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstructed</a> by Mulder in "Oubliette". When Scully suggests that Mulder's willingness to protect the potential suspect was due to the fact that she was a kidnapping victim (like Mulder's own sister), he argues that not everything he does goes back to his sister and states that "sometimes motivations for behavior can be more complex and mysterious than tracing them back to one single childhood experience". Despite that, though, it is beyond doubt that Mulder's obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a> is a consequence of his sister's abduction.
</li><li> It's played straight in the episode "Fire". Mulder has to face his fear of fire, which goes back to a single traumatic event in his childhood when his best friend's house burned down. He overcomes it — he saves two children from flames, and it's never mentioned again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, while the title character has had his OCD and phobias since he was born, when he met his wife Trudy he began to suppress them and live a fairly normal life. When she was killed by a car bomb, they came back worse than ever, rendering Monk unable to leave his apartment for three years and barely able to function on his own even after he did. He's implied to get better again when he finally solves Trudy's murder <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and meet her daughter Molly</span> in the series finale.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em> episode "Murdochophobia", Murdoch reveals that he has a previously unmentioned fear of butterflies. By the end of the episode, he realises that this is because he associates them with his mother's death, and he seems reasonably comfortable in a room filled with them.

Throughout the show, Robbie treats his ventriloquist dummy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Rex</a> like a real person, even having conversations with him when no one's around. In an episode where Rex gets broken, Jade suggests they use the opportunity to trick Robbie into thinking Rex is dead, believing it will solve his mental problems. Tori backs out at the last minute and convinces Robbie that his puppet is still alive, so the audience never gets to see if this will work. However, there's a later episode where Robbie sells Rex. Robbie simply buys another puppet, which he treats the same way, suggesting that his psychological issues are more complex and that getting rid of Rex wouldn't have solved anything.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Equus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Equus">Equus</a></em>. Alan's problems are a result of various issues that were building up over his entire life, and he would probably have continued to be a fairly normal (if withdrawn) boy if they had been spotted earlier, or if there hadn't been a fairly specific series of triggers. Dr. Dysart uses the metaphor of a group of metal pins lying scattered with no shape or structure, until a magnet is applied to one part and then suddenly all these previously harmless experiences and thoughts snap together and form links to various outcomes.

The process of treating each of the insane plush toys is incredibly complex and risky, though, and mistreatment can cause them to completely revert to their original state, so at least the game subverts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy">Epiphany Therapy</a>. That said, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> factor alone makes the headaches worth it.

To be fair, this battle is going on inside their minds rather than outside their heads and much of the cure seems to be sorting out their problems on a very deep level in a metaphorical fashion.
<ul><li> Also averted in that you also help relieve emotional baggage, remove the clutter of figments, clean up the mental cobwebs, and unlock mental vaults to further cement their sanity. Though any major problems can probably be fixed with a boss battle.
<ul><li> Also averted in that the slide-shows reveal in pictures nuances to the character's issues, without bogging narrative with exposition and explanation, without slowing down gameplay, and without going over the heads of the intended audience.
</li><li> Even further averted in relation to people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who are capable of hiding some issues from even the deepest mental probing, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only reason you can cure Olieander is because his mind becomes tangled with the main character's less crazy mind</span>. Not to mention the security guard whose mind was so twisted that Raz made him even <em>worse</em> after the boss fight.
</li><li> The last may be a minor moment of character development for Raz as well; he didn't go in with the intention of making Boyd better. He just wanted to find the Milkman, who had the keys to get past a door. He succeeded far too well, and when you get down to it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> is the only reason a lot of people didn't die that night as a result (and <em>that's</em> the only reason Boyd ends up at all better). Raz's attitude towards the minds he enters gets a bit more altruistic after that point.

She's a big bundle of crazy, caused by the fact that she grew up tortured and experimented on.

Largo and Erika on the other hand tie many of their issues to a single event, one which both of them prove extremely melodramatic about. Largo hangs all the neuroses that he cares about on the Endgames incident. He was probably still an obsessive, hard-drinking, and generally unstable guy before that, because he seems to think that's fine and normal. Erika, on the other hand, sees her big incident not as the cause of all her problems, but as the moment of her epiphany, when she realised just how screwed up her life had become. It proceeded to get even more screwed up from there, of course.

Her many, many other traumas coincidentally related to airplanes were ignored by her psychologist: "Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry." Inverted in that they were ignored not because they weren't relevant, but because now that they had made headway with her fear of flying Marge's therapist wanted to move forward with her far more serious problem- being married to Homer.
<ul><li> Similarly parodied in the episode where Homer reveals that he found a corpse when he was twelve: "It's responsible for everything wrong with my life! My occasional overeating!

Eventually he snaps and yells at the whole town after everybody had turned out and done a poor job of rebuilding his house. He checks himself into a mental hospital where we learn that Ned never learned to express anger. This is apparently because he was a hellion as a child, and his parents were beatniks who never disciplined him. He got over that by being spanked continuously for a year by a therapist. That same therapist comes back and gets Ned to admit that he hates his parents, and Ned is immediately "cured." Hard to be completely sure if it's supposed to be a subversion, a parody, or what. However, considering Ned then says, with a cheery grin and an eye tick, that he'll run anyone who really pisses him off over with his car, and that this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, you'd get good odds on a parody.

<ul><li> Much of this confusion stems from "ego psychology", the school of Freudian-inspired psychology (which made significant alterations to Freud) that flourished in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> and more or less defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych">Hollywood Psych</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a> for generations. Ego psychologically argued the existence of a "conflict-free" part of the mind and argued that people could adjust to society and become better people, which was fundamentally against Freud's views, which refused to pass moral and qualitative judgment on conflicts inside the ego as being necessarily good or bad, and which certainly was skeptical that "adjusting to society" was any sort of goal, especially since it implied that the society in question was good, which Freud (a Viennese Jew in a very anti-semitic Austria) certainly did not believe to be true, and which wasn't entirely true of forties and fifties' America either.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud">Sigmund Freud</a> is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> by some for advocating that once you unearthed someone's big ol' trauma, they were cured. In actual fact, he repeatedly argued the opposite. He noted that psychology in the individual has multiple aspects, there's the ego formation, the Oedipus complex, the development of the sexual drive, then repression and substitutions, but in a later state, there is "the return of the repressed" and "the repetition-compulsion complex" which actively prevents people from fully removing or tackling their issues, and which might actually not be entirely a bad thing since it was likely that this neurosis actually led to other positive qualities that person may have, and that a better way is self-awareness and attaining a level of control rather than entirely removing it. Notably, Freud criticized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarlJung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarlJung">Carl Jung</a> for arguing that humanity has multiple issues and multiple paths but merely catalogued these issues and argued that knowing this will solve problems.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in regard to three things:
<ul><li> The discovery of a "mental" illness actually being a physical/hormonal/neurological illness. Someone who is anemic, hypo or hyperthyroid, epileptic, in severe pain, or having a major hormonal imbalance <em>can</em> seem to be speedily recovering or even cured when being properly treated, especially because many of the "coping" and "disordered" behaviors disappear with their body and brain recovering.
</li><li> Someone realizing what their triggers are, if their mental illness is trigger-dependent (as some forms of depression and anxiety are, as PTSD and complicated grief are, and as some other illnesses can be). Not in the sense that it totally resolves all of their problems, but identifying triggers and focusing on response to them (or at least on avoiding them while they work on it) can be almost as dramatic as any Hollywood "cure," in providing relief and remission of the worst symptoms, even though it's not a 100 percent cure and is only a first step.
</li><li> Someone being removed from a situation of abuse/leaving a situation of abuse, leaving a high-demand organization, or freed from slavery can experience a <em>huge</em> amount of relief and happiness upon leaving, especially if they've realized the situation as abusive/enslavement/manipulative or the like. Whether they actually need <em>intense</em> follow up psychological and psychiatric care (such as inpatient programs or the like, as opposed to a counselor they are free to contact or not contact) depends on the person, how long they were "in," what their own coping mechanisms are, what types of abuse and control they experienced, and far more individually.
