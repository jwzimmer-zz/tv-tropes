</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>So, someone else will, of course, do it for us. Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic">fanfics</a> that don't involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shipping</a> will fill in any gaps, often with wild adventures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">that one would expect would get more of a mention in the work if they'd happened, but don't</a>. Anything in a work of fiction that leaves inviting gaps can be seen as fanfic fuel. The more outrageous or open for interesting plot developments, the better.
</p><p>Summers between school years in high school dramas are often great sources of <strong>Fanfic Fuel</strong>, as well as the draw of giving a mysterious character more backstory (which may result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a>) or rewriting things from the perspective of someone else whose viewpoint we never saw in canon.

The same goes for the ideas on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> pages.
<ul><li> Similarly, many one-shot comics and manga (as well as TV pilots) can be used as plots for fanfiction.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuities</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timelines</a> can be made when the writer makes their own version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">sequel</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> in a series or they might even rewrite the original story if they feel the creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot</a>.
</li><li> Characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">whose potential is never truly unlocked by the canon writers</a> will often be taken up by the fanfic writers instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a> invites possible sequels. Writers may also give specific characters their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Offs</a> at that.
<ul><li> When a character seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Hero of Another Story</a>, fanfic writers may be tempted to...well, write that story.
</li></ul></li><li> Any work with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> that doesn't cover the intervening period in enough detail.
</li><li> Crossovers with other works of fiction. For example, if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> does a crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, then it's more likely to see fanfics about <em>Pokémon/Star Wars</em> crossovers than <em>Pokémon</em>/anything else crossovers, especially if the release date of said crossover is near. Even years after said crossover occurred, it will be likely to see hardcore fans of both franchises write fanfics about one franchise crossing with another. This is especially prevalent in shared universes (like the Marvel and DC comics universes). The more crossovers two franchises have, the more likely it is to see fanfics being written about those two franchises crossing over together. Amusingly, the opposite can also be true: If a lot of fanfics cross one franchise with another that it has never crossed with before canonically, then MAYBE the owners of said franchises will get together to make their franchises cross over, because they know that said crossover will be a huge hit and make them a lot of money.
</li><li> Putting two characters in a cave or similar small space together will result in a few hundred fics about them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lemon">getting it on</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel">POV Sequels</a>: Parallel stories that may take place just prior to, concurrently, or just subsequently of notable canon events or those same events are seen from a different angle by other characters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonEntity">Sequel Non-Entity</a> characters are practically engraved invitations. <em>Something</em> must have happened to them to prevent their appearance in the sequel.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> of a character is a good source of this.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> is something from the past that is sometimes referred to but never properly explained, with the implication that whatever the truth is, it's far less interesting than anything the audience can imagine. Naturally, any improperly explained incident is just begging for a fic or two dedicated to it.
</li><li> Series that end abruptly or unsatisfactorily, as Henry Jenkins cites in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TextualPoachersTelevisionFansAndParticipatoryCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TextualPoachersTelevisionFansAndParticipatoryCulture">Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture</a></em>:

</div></li><li> Entirely new characters who live in the same fictional universe of a franchise and whose specific relation/association to the original characters may or may not be revealed. They can be complete strangers, new close friends, relatives including ancestors and descendants. In some cases, such as certain epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fics, the story develops such complexity that few, if any, traces of the original remain.

Also, there is the fact that we know there were at least 20 androids created by Dr. Gero, but we don't know all of them; the fact that Saiyans were sent to other planets when they were babies to grow up with the planet's civilization to later destroy them and come back to Planet Vegeta, that left open the idea that there may be other Saiyans still alive, living in the planets they were assigned to destroy; the alternative Universe Future!Trunks came from, and the idea that more alternative dimensions can be created with the Time Machine... <em>Dragon Ball</em> is totally made out of fanfic fuel. But it was to be expected from a story of such length (and that was mostly improvised by Toriyama!) and for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles">Plot Holes</a> created by the anime series that needed to keep adding fillers while waiting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">the manga to catch up</a>.

</li><li> The nature of being a Nation is touched on briefly in the series, but much is left up for speculation - like what exactly leads to a Nation's 'disappearance', how emotionally damaging is it to be immortal and how being forced to comply with their bosses' wishes (as is implied with WWII-Germany) affects them.

<ul><li> <em>Sailor Moon</em> spans millennia and follows only a dozen or so girls of what could be hundreds. Naoko did say that there could be senshi all over the universe, and we even meet a couple dozen alien senshi in the last arc/season. Therefore, there's <em>reams</em> of Silver Millennium, Crystal Tokyo, and "Team Other Than The Sol Senshi" stories out there, and the pile grows all the time. Basically, for any celestial body, there's a Sailor for that.
</li><li> There's also Jadeite's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> fate.

So the series has a 200-episode (plus an OVA or two) run and ends with no such dramatic return, well, it kinda seemed like an oversight, and fans have been correcting it ever since. He's not even that remarkable a villain and doesn't get much in the way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>; it just feels so <em>wrong</em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> doesn't get fired. On the other hand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> Jadeite is pretty definitely dead.

As only the mirror counterparts of Ash, his current traveling companions, some of their Pokémon, and Team Rocket are shown, this leaves the door wide open for Mirror World incarnations of other characters. For that matter, how would the <em>X/Y</em> saga differ (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail">if at all</a>) because of said characters' differences in temperament and ability?

Since this is in a movie, many would think that Ash's Aura potential would be forgotten...until we come across two episodes of the series that reference Aura in such a way that implies that Ash's adventures in Rota Town happened in some form. "He's using his Aura unconsciously" has become a very valid explanation as to how Ash does most of the things he does.

A <em>lot</em> of fanfics that feature him explore this further, each author giving opinions on what at least some of them are.
<ul><li> And on that note: Fire Dragon. The first OP shows him flanked by two monsters: Water Dragon, a dragon made of water that we do see him use, and a similar monster made of fire, that we do not, nicknamed Fire Dragon by fans. Some take his later monster Carbogeddon to be related to it (since Water Dragon is created from two Hydrogeddons and one Oxygeddon), but it was never elaborated upon.

<ul><li> Considering that, one, most of the canonical experiments remain yet to be seen to this day, and two, experiments <em>after</em> Stitch have been made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch">the franchise's</a> canon, there are still going to be plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth">fan experiments</a> for years to come.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> has a lot of this. For starters, the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>, the never ending Circle of Life, means that you can write sagas of the royal lion family. Then, there are lots of characters that were introduced but not developed in comics or books, like Ni, Tama, Tojo. Also there are many story gaps that fanfic writers love to fill, like the years of Scar's reign (or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">supposed</a> relationship with Zira), or where the Outlanders from the second movie came from.

<ul><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>, what would your toy collection coming to life be like?

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>: Given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nick becomes Judy's partner on the force at the end of the film</span> there are a HUGE number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> Fics that have the two of them solving various crimes around the City. And given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a> relationship they had at the end of the film, it's not at all uncommon for these to also involve heavy amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Shipping</a>.
<ul><li> The titular city is inhabited only by terrestrial mammals. Lots of fans have had fun coming up with other cities in the same world to accommodate birds, reptiles, amphibians, and marine mammals.
</li><li> The film also has plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/Zootopia">scrapped concepts</a> that fanfic writers have used in different ways:
<ul><li> Originally the film was to centre on a spy rabbit called Jack Savage. Now, Savage has no end of fan art, and appearances alongside Nick and Judy in various capacities in fanfics. Frequently seen in many of these fics is a fox character named Skye, who originated from a bit of art from the "Jack Savage" draft, and is often used by fanfic writers as a partner or love interest of Jack's.
</li><li> After the Jack Savage draft was dropped, the creators moved on to a considerably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> version of the final film that had Nick as the protagonist, and had predators forced to wear shock collars. Naturally, fanfic writers have been keen to make AU fics about what this version of the film might have been like. Some other pics try to find ways to bring either specific concepts from this version (like the shock collars) or characters that didn't make the final draft (like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> badger named Honey or an antagonist pig Mayor named Swinton) into the same universe as the final film.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's Nighthowler and its effects, especially with the revelation that prey <em>can</em> be affected by the toxin.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBossBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBossBaby">The Boss Baby</a></em>: At one point during his visit to Baby Corp, Tim asks the titular Boss Baby why he doesn't remember his time at the company, and the Boss Baby mentions that all babies who work there forget all about it once their company pacifiers are taken away. This provides fanfic writers plenty of opportunities to explore what Tim's time at the company might have been like before the events of the movie.

<ul><li> The third film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, seems to practically be powered by fanfic fuel. First off, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> - the film takes place eight years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, hence a gap for fanfic writers to have a stab at. Then, there are all the backstories of the characters introduced in the film. Bane's background and how he got excommunicated from the League of Shadows. Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate, how she rose up the ranks and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her relationship with her father, Ra's al Ghul</span>, and the slightly shippy nature of her relationship with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bane</span>. GCPD Officer John Blake - his growing up in the orphanage, his police training and, once the film ends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how he takes on the mantle of Batman as a Batman-Robin-Nightwing hybrid</span>. And of course, Selina Kyle. Her past, how she met her roommate Jen, her misadventures as a younger girl and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the little Bat-Cat babies she and Bruce would have, since the film ends with them together.</span>
</li><li> To say nothing of the fact that everyone in <em>Rises</em> seems to go out of their way to pretend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">never even existed</a>.

The movie doesn't go into much detail about this, but there are many ideas that can inspire a fanfic. One is how the nations of Earth are shown to dislike the Transformers (there's a mentioning of poll results stating that half the world would feel safer if the Autobots left). One must also wonder how other countries feel about the US using Autobots for non-Decepticon related problems (such as destroying illegal nuclear plants in the Middle East). Overall, there's a whole potential to explore how Earth must cope with the knowledge that one of the world's most powerful nations has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> on its side, as well as the fact that said support also warrants even more alien attacks.
<ul><li> There's also the matter of why Mikaela broke up with Sam.

</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> opens up multiple storytelling possibilities, which may or may not be explored in future movies:

So, with all that in mind, what happens next?
</li></ul></li><li> Pick any fic with Peter Parker as the focus. One of the following scenarios will likely be explored:
<ul><li> Aunt May's subsequent reaction to the end of <em>Homecoming</em> when she discovers Peter's identity, and how Peter convinces her to let him continue.
</li><li> Aunt May gets a bridge dropped on her solely so that Tony can swoop in and adopt the boy as a son, sometimes with Pepper as his new mother. Occasionally, a different Avenger becomes Peter's primary caretaker before Tony comes into the picture, or several Avengers (sometimes in a <em>Civil War</em>-noncompliant arrangement or not; Bucky Barnes optional) become his new family, but it's usually just Tony.
</li><li> Tony elevating Peter's "internship" to an actual one, allowing him to work alongside him on various projects.
</li><li> An explanation of the exact circumstances of Peter getting his powers, usually involving Oscorp.
</li><li> The Avengers reuniting after Civil War, and their reaction to the knowledge that Tony had drafted a kid in the battles. Expect such nuances as Black Widow calling Peter "Little Spider", Cap freaking out at his having dropped an airport bridge on Peter, and them deciding to train Peter better since he won't stop being Spiderman.
</li></ul></li><li> Peter's class taking a field trip to Avengers Tower/Facility, and their reactions, (especially Flash's), reaction to finding out that Peter does know Tony Stark and the Avengers. For bonus points and hilarity, Peter's identity may be revealed to them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The urSkek—the race that was split into the urRu and the Skeksis—are canonically <em>not</em> native to the planet of Thra, but arrived there after being banished from an entirely different world. Where did they come from? What was their world like? And what kinds of adventures did they have there?
</li><li> Mother Aughra is canonically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">one of the oldest beings in Thra</a>, and has witnessed most of the important events in the planet's long history. What kind of adventures did she have in her younger days?
</li><li> Even before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance">The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</a></em> came out, there were tons of fanfics speculating about what Thra was like before the Skeksis seized the Crystal, and what Gelfling society was like before the Skeksis wiped them out.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet2010">A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)</a></em> remake briefly suggested at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist">Plot Twist</a> where Freddy Kruger was actually innocent of the crimes he'd been killed for - this turned out to be nothing more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, but nevertheless, the fanfic writers took to it like a fish to water...

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> offers lots of these. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal">A.A. Pessimal</a> exploits one-shot cameo characters who appear at most twice and barely exist outside a name and a job description; other hooks in the Pessimal universe are all the countries and regions of the Discworld that are hinted at in canon and have enough "shape" to suggest what they look like and which Roundworld countries they reflect and take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. A Discworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a> emerged, for instance, populated by examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner">Amoral Afrikaner</a>. There's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a> based on a handful of references to a country, a people and a religion. Events in the history of the Disc, such as the Latatian Empire and its fall, and the Dark War of antiquity, are also filled in. Most lately, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a> is emerging.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, there's the mysterious death of a whole family that is never really solved. One can believe it was coincidence, but with family sizes of about fifty people, that's not really likely - fuel for wild conspiracy fanfic. And then there are the events of the past, that are only told in flashbacks, and some only mentioned in passing, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keifer poisoning the princesses' father</span>. The story ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jerin's wedding</span>, and Jerin is certain that he'll be happy - but will he?
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> (students, ghosts, professors, shopkeepers) and several summer holidays for those characters to have adventures on. The main trio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em> are away from Hogwarts for much of the year, so that leaves even more gaps to fill.
<ul><li> Also, the very explicit, but non-detailed events and descriptions mentioned by various characters throughout the series, coupled with very effective characterization set up by the chapter "Snape's Worst Memory" have given rise to a huge quantity of fanfic set in the era of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, with dozens of different plays on various unseen canon events.
</li><li> Not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuationFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuationFic">the future of the Wizarding World after the events of the main series</a>, seeing as how it ends with an explicit epilogue showing the characters as married couples with children. Rowling has also been surprisingly generous about offering hints about the future lives of the characters, including such tidbits as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">McGonagall as the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, Kingsley as the new Minister of Magic, Harry and Ron as Aurors, Hermione as a crusading reformer at the Ministry, Ginny as a professional Quidditch player, Neville as a Hogwarts professor, Harry's children stealing the Marauder's Map and using it to sneak into Hogwarts</span>, and many, many more.
</li><li> And there's the short span in which Ron and Hermione are absent from the narrative in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, during which they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get basilisk fangs and destroy a Horcrux. Considering how emotionally traumatizing destroying a Horcrux is, and that they have their first on-screen kiss immediately following this,</span> there's an entire sub-genre of fanfic there.
</li><li> J.K. Rowling has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">expanded upon</a> the Wizarding World outside of Britain, including some choice details about four previously unseen Wizarding schools. There's Ilvermorny in North America (which Native American spiritual leaders apparently had a hand in founding), Mahoutokoro in Japan (located on a remote volcanic island near Iwo Jima), Uagadou in Uganda (a massive fortress carved into the side of the mythical Mountains of the Moon), and Castelobruxo (which is located in the thick of the Amazon rainforest, and guarded by the local Caipora). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> film gives some more frame to these by taking place in the United States in the 1920's.
</li><li> There are enough hints dropped about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">mythical figures</a> in the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe to fill up an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>. Among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin">Merlin</a> is name-dropped constantly (and he studied at Hogwarts, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>), Morgana le Fey is apparently a famous witch, the Greek hero Bellerophon was a famous Greek wizard, and "Fluffy" may or may not be related to the legendary Cerberus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a> is in full-swing in the Potterverse.
</li></ul></li><li> Two points in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> have launched a thousand fics:
<ul><li> 1.) Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em> covers the first several days the main characters spend in Narnia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> devotes approximately two paragraphs in the final chapter to the following years — or likely, <em>decades</em> — they spend in Narnia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before abruptly returning (and de-aging) to England the very day they had left</span>.
</li><li> 2.) Susan's absence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle">The Last Battle</a></em> is brought up once, quickly dismissed, and never mentioned again. Adding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">the potency of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">this fuel</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">phrasing of the reason given for her absence</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElsewhereFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElsewhereFic">Elsewhere Fic</a> fuel aplenty. After all, <em>someone</em> (be it a canon character or an OC) has to have won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Games</a> for years 1-73, and most of them we know little or nothing about.
</li><li> Many times in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> canon, Dr. Watson includes references to cases that Holmes has solved but which were not fleshed into stories, such as the the tale of the giant rat of Sumatra (a story "for which the world is not yet ready"). A large percentage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a>, including published pastiche novels, centers on one or another of these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incidents</a>.
<ul><li> Also, the stories often end <em>immediately</em> after the mystery is solved, and any non-mystery fallout of the main plot, such as processing of criminals, recovery from traumatic events, shocking revelations and conflicts caused by a case, healing of injuries, explaining that needs to be done to other characters, etc, are usually dismissed with the implication that it was all taken care of without incident (or at least, without enough incident for Watson to spoil the pacing of his stories by reciting all the details). However, some of the implication of what these glossed-over details involve are quite intriguing — trials for the captured criminals, ruined families and friendships, swearing of revenge, or intensely emotional scenes between Holmes and Watson (or Holmes' apparent non-reaction to emotional incidents). Therefore, there are gazillions of fics revolving around the aftermath of various canon cases. In particular, there is a whole genre of fic involving Watson mourning Holmes/Holmes as a fugitive after The Final Problem or dealing with the reveal of Holmes not being dead in The Empty House. Holmes' fright about Watson's injury after The Three Garridebs, Watson throwing a fit at Holmes for his manipulation of him in The Dying Detective, and speculation about how Watson weaned Holmes off cocaine, are also common fanfic plots.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWrinkleInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWrinkleInTime">A Wrinkle in Time</a></em>, in addition to all the science fiction elements not explored in great detail (the history of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndividualityIsIllegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndividualityIsIllegal">planet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Camazotz</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">2-dimensional planet</a>, etc.), there's also the specific story of the project Meg's father was working on (with the tesseract) and what happened to the first man who tried to tesser. He's mentioned <em>very</em> briefly, when Meg's father is giving Calvin some of the backstory about the project. He left successfully, but they never found out what happened to him (and none of the sequels give any indicator, either).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">John Carter of Mars</a></em> has several unresolved plots. The most obvious example is the fact that the last novel, <em>Skeleton Men of Jupiter</em>, has an open ending with the protagonist still stranded on Jupiter. Other examples are the fact that by the end of <em>A Fighting Man of Mars</em> Ghasta is still ruled by the evil Jed Ghron, the missing flier 'The Dusar' from <em>Llana of Gathol</em>, and of course John Carter's own mysterious past, the question how old he realy is and why he cannot remember any childhood.

The vast majority of the epic Yeerk-Andalite War has still never been seen, leaving it a wide-open canvas for fanfic writers to play with.

</li><li> How come Archie knew Drury Lane like it was his home? Was he an avid theatregoer? Was he a teenage actor? To what extent did he know Kitty Cobham? Usually involves lots of love for The Bard, because Archie was fond of Shakespeare and quoted him, both sober and delirious.

The dominant one is the (in)famous "red K summer" between season two and three, which involves Clark on red kryptonite, which stripped his inhibitions and turned him into an amoral party animal, while Chloe visited him and tried to get him home.

And the boys didn't realise that they weren't fully human until Doc Fraiser tried to take a blood sample... So everything must be there. I shudder to think of how many fanfics out there have them realising that the military regulations that keep the real Jack and Sam apart no longer apply to the android versions...
<ul><li> Then there's the episode where a rogue Asgard made a teenaged clone of Jack. The clone survived the episode and went off to live his own life. There's all kinds of trouble a kid with the memories and skills of a special-forces veteran can get into.

</li></ul></li><li> Let's also not forget the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jim Wright:</strong> I'm sure this opening shot alone sparked a dozen fanfics. Many of which included the words "Yes, Mistress."

The rest of their childhood leaves plenty of questions. Just how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> did the boys actually suffer? How many schools did they go to? What caused the rift between Bobby and John? The list goes on.
<ul><li> There are also the multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityEpisode">alternate realities</a> established/suggested: "What Is and What Should Never Be" (2x20), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">"It's A Terrible Life"</a> (4x17), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">"The End"</a> (5x04), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">"My Heart Will Go On"</a> (6x17).
</li><li> Also, the four months Dean was in hell (or the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">forty years</a>, depending on the brother the fic focuses on).
</li><li> The season finales have a tendency to leave a few questions unanswered, which has authors try to explain what will happen before the next season premieres. There are also frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">time skips</a> between seasons, which work for this.

Only Tori and Trina's parents are seen regularly, Jade's dad was mentioned on one occasion, and both Beck's parent's appeared off screen in on episode. Often fics that mention the parents will have Andre's parents dead, Jade's parents either abusive (especially if it's an angsty fic) or just neglectful and uncaring, the latter being more supported by canon. Cat's parents are generally pretty neglectful as well, though just <em>how</em> neglectful they are depends on the fic. Robbie, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> will almost never, <em>ever</em>, have a happy home life, and as of "Locked Up'' that view is pretty supported by canon. Beck's usually the only one who will have anything close to good parents, although there will usually be a few issues considering that he lives in an RV just so he can get away from them.

How did Xander get turned? How did Willow? What happened with Darla? How did Angel became a wreck?
</li><li> Insert!Dawn-Fic: Everyone in the Cast was given false memories of Buffy's little sister Dawn in the Fifth season.

There are many, many fics about just how Mulder and Scully got from the end scene of "all things" to the opening shot of the same episode; it's heavily implied they slept together, but doesn't show anything else.

</li><li> The fate of Scully's son William whom she put up for adoption. Many, many fans disliked it and thought his adoptive parents could not protect him from the conspiracy. The fics are about Mulder and Scully searching for him or describing his life.

<ul><li> A sizable genre of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheMagnusArchives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheMagnusArchives">The Magnus Archives</a></em> fanfiction is "Scotland fic" - namely, fanfiction that covers the three-week <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between episodes 159 and 160 that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Jon and Martin</a> spent in a safehouse in the Scottish highlands. The popularity of these fanfics can be attributed to two main reasons. One, because episode 160 was followed by a six-month hiatus, during which the show surged in popularity. And two, because the end of episode 159 heavily implies that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're now an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a></span>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed this, and stated that it will be more explicit in season 5.

<ul><li> <em>Pokémon</em> has generated massive numbers of fanfics over the years, thanks to the sheer cultural presence in the childhoods of an entire generation.

<ul><li> The fandom is particularly fond of writing fics about Liquid's backstory (usually set during his time in the Middle East) or the day The Boss killed The Sorrow. In fact, these two plots are so popular in <em>MGS</em> fan fiction that almost every male <em>MGS</em> fan writer has taken on the former, and almost every female <em>MGS</em> fan writer has taken on the latter.

<ul><li> The Fallen Human's backstory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Chara AND Frisk's.</span> The backstory we have is anywhere between vague to nonexistent, so it's fertile ground for fan expansion.
</li><li> What happens after the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">True Pacifist</span> ending. While what we see is incredibly upbeat and happy, that doesn't stop people from exploring just how both human and monster society deals with such a sudden change in dynamic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">Fix Fics</a> regarding the ultimate fate of Flowey<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Asriel</span>. Even the best ending seems to give him the shaft, and more than a few people can't help but feel obligated to try and help give even him a happy ending.
</li><li> Along with those, what is the fate of the monsters when they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reach the human world</span>, and how did they get to where they are? There are some things that happen that couldn't have happened within a short time after the game ended (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Toriel teaching at a school being the most obvious</span>).
</li><li> Who are the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">six human souls</span>, and what is their backstory? Very little is actually given about them in terms of information.
</li><li> What if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the skeletons</span> switched roles is a popular story. Specifically, what if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you killed Sans first? Would Papyrus become a badass and be the one to give you a hard time</span>?
<ul><li> While we're at it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how did Sans get his abilities in the first place? And when (and how) did he become aware of the reset situation</span>?
</li></ul></li><li> Who the hell IS <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Gaster</span>, and what happened to him to cause him (and those who knew him real well) to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not exist anymore</span>?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> takes place ten years after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. The Eastern Brotherhood of Steel have reverted to a xenophobic and traditionalist ideology, Owyn Lyons has passed away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and so has his daughter Sarah</span> and been replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Arthur</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">Maxson</a>, and we have only a few concrete details into the state of the Capital Wasteland except the fact that the Brotherhood have established <em>de facto</em> rule of the region as feudalistic overlords. This has led to some downright <em>juicy</em> speculation into events just after the ending of <em>3</em>, the fate or whereabouts of the Lone Wanderer and of other characters, and the current state of affairs in the Capital Wasteland.
<ul><li> Considering how, as of <em>Fallout 4</em>, all of the canon games (aside from <em>Tactics</em>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">kinda</a>) have been based on only the West and East Coasts of the former United States — <em>Fallout 1</em> takes place in southern California, <em>2</em> takes place in northern California, <em>3</em> takes place around Washington D.C. (along with Pittsburgh and Point Lookout National Park), <em>New Vegas</em> takes place around Las Vegas and Zion National Park, and <em>4</em> is located around Boston (along with western Massachusetts and Bar Harbor, Maine). Many fans love to come up with theories on what's happened to the rest of the continent. Only a few allusions have been made by the games to what societies exist outside of these two regions (i.e., Ronto, the Erie Stretch, Great Lanta, Crater Banks, and the countless tribes not assimilated by Caesar's Legion or the NCR), so it's mostly been left to fans to decide what <em>other</em> societies have appeared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">in the intervening centuries</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> has <em>two</em> backstories: one of a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a> that spawned the titular organization, and another of the exploits and controversies of said organization in the years following the war's conclusion. With much of the details being fairly hazy, both with the plot and with the characters' individual backstories, fans have planted a record number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> despite the game being relatively young.

Add in the monster's ability to create new breeds opening up the possibility for fan made creations and their extradimensional nature serving as an easy excuse to drop them into any other fictional universe and you have ripe grounds for fanfiction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kirby's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a> ability technically gives him an unlimited array of potential powers. And with Kirby having abilities that range from martial arts and electricity to ringing bells and parasols, it's quite fun to imagine potential powers for the little guy. And what makes it even more fun is the possibility of them becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">actual powers in an official Kirby game</a>.

This allows fan creations of Admirals in all kinds of variations (male or female, old or young, even "Abyssal" Admirals for the enemy faction might exist) as well as battleships without a canon girl equivalent, and fan stories can be almost anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em> has little to no context and background information for many areas and characters, including Madotsuki herself, leaves the game's canon very open to fan interpretation and expansion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that still contains tons of blank spaces, like the epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Keyblade Wars</a>, and the mysterious period before the fracturing of the Multiverse.

In the SP games we're given several glimpses of what life on Na Pali used to be before/after the Skaarj invasion, the crash of the ISV-Kran, the landing of the Mercenaries and before the crash of the UMS Vortex Rikers, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Prisoner 849</a>'s vague backstory.

In the <em>Tournament</em> and <em>Championship</em> games we get vague backstories for every character, location, weapon and vehicle, barring some exceptions.

Also, <em>Korra</em>'s comparatively faster pace means that a lot of background details that aren't directly relevant to the plot are left open-ended, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingWithTheEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingWithTheEx">the specifics of past relationships</a>, the exact details of villains' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">rises to power</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonentity">even the fates of some of the main characters of The Last Airbender</a>. Considering the creators are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">well aware</a> of how their show's fandom operates, this is almost undoubtedly intentional. In fact in the Book 4 commentary, they told people to write fanfic about Mako's relationship with Zuko's granddaughter because they couldn't fit her into the show.
</li><li> Another example for The Legend of Korra is alternative starting points for Korra and Asami's relationship. In season 1, Asami's father is an Equalist, an anti-bending revolutionary. A popular fanfic origin is one in which Asami fully serves them rather than turning on her father and siding with Korra. This generally involves Asami attemping to seduce Korra. A similar situation occurs with Korrra having been captured by the Red Lotus as a child, at which point she and Asami are on opposite sides for a different reason, until they inevitably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">find each other</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The history between Marceline and Simon Petrikov on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>. As the show went on, it's clear that Simon's morals and ethics were a heavy influence on a young Marceline, serving as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>. Fans enjoy exploring their bond, coming up with stories that either take place in the immediate aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicHate">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWar3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWar3">Mushroom</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">War</a> (which is this trope in of itself) or take place after Simon is returned to normal in present-day Ooo, to nothing of the various AU fics where he at least makes an appearance as a mentor figure.
<ul><li> For that matter, the relationship between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Simon and Betty</span> seems to get a lot of attention.
</li></ul></li><li> The never-seen biological parents of the title characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>. Phineas's mother and Ferb's father are married, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">they consider them their parents</a>, and no mention is ever made of what happened to their biological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">father</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">mother</a>, respectively. This has led to a <em>lot</em> of fan speculation on the subject.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>: in the episode "Welcome to OttoWorld" the Rocket gang burries a time capsule and wonders if anyone will remember them in the future. The episode ends with a scene in which the time capsule is opened again in the distant future, and we get to see four statues of the protagonists. What did they do to apparently get this famous?
</li><li> Thanks to its untimely end, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">the original writer, Steve Marmel's plans</a> rejected for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">the third season that did happen</a>, many things in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a> are prime targets for Fanfic Fuel. Two particular favorites are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">Dark Danny</a>'s return, which the show promised but never actually included, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Danielle "Dani" Phantom</a> being introduced to Danny's family, resulting in her being adopted.
<ul><li> Fans also often wonder what, exactly, happened when Danny first gained his powers, and in the month after that, since the show more-or-less skips over those things - the accident in which he got his powers is only shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">Expository Theme Tune</a> and in the episode "Memory Blank" (and in that episode, we only see a few photos of the event, and the characters <em>recreating</em> it), and we don't see what happened in that first month at <em>all</em>. The show also raises some questions about the nature of ghosts and the Ghost Zone, which fans like to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">come up with creative answers for</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> gets quite a lot of this with its large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">cancellation-induced</a> cliffhanger ending.

</li><li> Four words: "The Tournament of Heroines". Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> can only guess how this event at the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TeenTitansS2E9WinnerTakeAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TeenTitansS2E9WinnerTakeAll">Winner Take All</a>" turned out, but writers just <em>love</em> giving their own $0.02 on it. (And <em>all</em> of them notice that Terra was in the background; how that's handled depends on the writer's personal views of the character.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> was supposed to end with <em>The Jungle Movie</em>, which would have seen Arnold and Helga admit their true feelings for each other, and would have seen Arnold finding his parents, but the show was cancelled and the movie was put on the back-burner. However, creator Craig Bartlett has revealed bits and pieces of the finale's intended plot, and the fanfic community has responded in kind. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> producing it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">a TV movie over a decade later</a>, the fans can now see how similar their takes on the story were to the final film.
<ul><li> Ditto for Bartlett's unproduced spinoff <em>The Patakis</em>, about the home life of a teenaged Helga. The pilot script was apparently too dark for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, but Bartlett has revealed enough details for the fanfic writers to use. Unlike <em>The Jungle Movie</em>, Nickelodeon has not given this the green light yet.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> format of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> has naturally led to a plethora of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomSpecificPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomSpecificPlot">fan seasons</a>, often populated entirely by OC's. Not to mention the possibilities for what happens to the canon characters <em>after</em> the show (or before or between seasons).
<ul><li> Mike has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">disorder</a> that basically guarantees he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">traumatic past</a> before joining the show, but this is never elaborated on. The introduction of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">evil alter</a>, Mal, only adds more fanfic fuel to the fire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> is an absolute treasure trove of this, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToLast">its rather abrupt cancellation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">the creator's extremely detailed notes about the planned future of the mythos</a>.
<ul><li> There was going to be a <em>Dark Ages</em> prequel spinoff focused on the early days of the Wyvern Clan in Medieval Scotland, when Goliath and Demona were still young lovers fighting under Hudson's guidance. Not to mention a planned <em>Gargoyles: 2198</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a>, with the cast's descendants fighting off an alien invasion (first hinted at in "Sentinel") in the far future. Both concepts practically beg for fanfiction.
</li><li> The released notes for <em>2198</em> confirm (among other tidbits) that Elisa and Natsilane's descendants would eventually have gotten together, that Lexington and Xanatos would eventually have merged corporations, and that a line of robots based on Lexington would eventually have entered production. All dynamite ideas for fanfiction.
</li><li> After fans pestered him about it in his "Ask Greg" Q&amp;A forum, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a> confirmed that he did have plans to work characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em> into the <em>Gargoyles</em> mythos. How would they have figured in the story? How would Weisman have portrayed them? How different would they have been from their literary counterparts? Note that the <em>Gargoyles</em> universe already includes sorcerers, Fae spirits, monstrous humanoids, volatile court politics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">an enchanted island fought over by various factions of sorcerers and spirits</a>; a retelling of <em>The Tempest</em> practically writes itself.
</li><li> After Demona and Macbeth were made immortal by the same magic spell, they canonically lived through over 900 years of human history—barely any of which has actually been seen in canon. What adventures did they get up to while Goliath and his pals were still sleeping in statue-form?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">The interstellar war between the N'Kai and the Space-Spawn</a>.
</li><li> Alexander Xanatos's time studying magic under Puck's tutelage.
</li><li> Alex Xanatos taking up the mantle of Fox from his mother (a possible future plot point that was hinted at in "Future Tense").
</li><li> Queen Titania's relationship with Halcyon Renard.
</li><li> Peter Maza's relationship with the trickster spirit Coyote (the specific nature of which was left rather vague in-show).
</li><li> The careers of Canmore's descendants who took up the mantle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">"The Hunter"</a> after him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">Lexington</a> acknowledging and coming to terms with his homosexuality.

</li><li> The history and true purpose of the Illuminati.
</li><li> The Redemption Squad's battle with the Illuminati after the cancellation of the <em>Gargoyles: Bad Guys</em> spinoff.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Brookyln</a>'s adventures traveling through time with the Phoenix Gate (which were going to be the basis of the proposed <em>Gargoyles: Timedancer</em> spinoff). All we really know from the comics is that his adventures involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower">losing an eye</a>, traveling to China and Japan, meeting his loyal pet companion Fu-Dog and his true love Katana, and eventually having a son named Nashville (with a second unhatched child nicknamed "Eggwardo" on the way). Whatever he got up to while time-traveling, he apparently had to seriously sharpen his combat skills in order to survive; when he's seen again, he's sporting an armored breastplate and packing a gun, a katana, and a pair of daggers.

Mystery Incorporated</a></em>: The original Mystery Incorporated team from the 1960s likely spent <em>at least</em> at much time solving mysteries as the classic crew, but their adventures are only hinted at in vague flashbacks. Exploring their adventures opens up a great opportunity for putting a darker spin on the classic <em>Scooby-Doo</em> formula.
<ul><li> Not to mention <em>Mystery Incorporated</em>'s many cryptic references to past historical mystery-solving organizations who were compelled to hunt down evildoers under the Evil Entity's influence. There were the Hunters of Secrets (a quartet of Mayan warriors with a pet jaguar), the Fraternitas Mysterium (a quartet of Spanish monks with a pet donkey), the Alianza Misterio (a quartet of masked Mexican outlaws with a pet skunk), the Mystery Gang (an all-female quartet of cowgirls with a pet bull), the Benevolent Lodge of Mystery (a secret society of Victorian inventors with a pet orangutan), and the Mystery Fellowship (an eccentric high-society family of detectives living in a dark mansion that <em>sank into the Earth</em>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> has some common jumping-off points:

The original air date for the season three finale was 1998, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">good reruns</a> on Cartoon Network brought about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">a fourth season</a> in 2001 to pick up on the Daemon arc. In the interim, fanfic writers had a field day telling a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-esque battle to save the net. When the fourth season finally aired, the story was notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">not the epic, sprawling battle expected</a> but isolated encounters that took up a whole 4 episodes to tell.

This leaves plenty of material for fans to create their own alien OCs or develop further the various planets. In addition, Ben is stated to have access to more than one million aliens on the Omnitrix, leaving a huge gap for fans to fill with their own fan-made aliens.

But in Gadget's case, her father, Geegaw Hackwrench, is mentioned enough to fuel the viewers' curiosity. He is only ever seen in a framed picture in "To the Rescue" part 3, and Gadget mentions that she has lost him more than one year prior to the events of this episode. What exactly happened to him remains unknown. In a show that has its fair share of mystery and thrillers, this just has to fuel the audience's curiosity.
</li><li> Speaking of Geegaw, he and Monty have been in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> in Zanzibar which involved a cheese bread and greatly upset Geegaw. While Monty tells a lot of tales from his past which may or may not be true, this is the one that the Rangerphiles really want to know more about.
</li><li> Gadget's mother remains entirely unmentioned. Neither Monty nor Gadget ever talks about her. But if <em>CDRR</em> fanfic writers have to solve the mystery of Geegaw's demise, it's only natural that they have to write something about her mother as well.
</li><li> Then there is "Good Times, Bat Times", the episode in which Dale ends up with Foxglove as his girlfriend. It's often considered the chronologically last episode (there is no defined chronology throughout a show that has the pilot in season 2). Either way, we don't find out how things go on with Dale in a relationship with a cute pink bat (unless you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">the Boom! comics</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a>). Will Foxy join the Rangers? What'll Chip do, now that he doesn't have any competition for Gadget anymore?
</li><li> How come there's a mouse in Hawaii that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">looks pretty much identical to Gadget</a>?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em> has a pretty devoted fanfic community, largely because of all the tantalizing questions about the characters that it leaves unanswered. Where exactly did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">Miss Frizzle</a> come from, and how did she get her famous bus? What sort of relationship did she have with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBusRidesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBusRidesAgain">her sister Fiona</a> before she replaced her as teacher? Are there any other teachers at the kids' school, and are they all as..."interesting" as Miss Frizzle? How did the kids handle adolescence and adulthood? And what were things <em>really</em> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">at Phoebe's old school</a>?
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> episode "Lars of the Stars", Lars and the Off-Colors have gone from forgotten dregs of society hiding from Robonoids in ancient, abandoned areas of Homeworld, to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a> who hijacked a ship, became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a> and gained an arch-nemesis. What happened in between hiding and escaping from Homeworld, and HOW did they manage those things?
<ul><li> The episode "A Single Pale Rose" reveals that Pearl has the phone numbers of (at least) nine people. She was shown receiving Mystery Girl's phone number at the end of "Last One Out Of Beach City", but it's unclear who the other numbers belong to. Where and how did Pearl get them?
</li><li> Gem society and history can also raise various questions, because although the show has plenty of worldbuilding, quite a few things are left to the imagination due to show never straying from Steven's POV and whatever concerns him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks">PJ Masks</a></em>: Due to the show lacking a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a> for the heroes and villains, the question of how the PJ Masks became superheroes and how they first met the Night Time Villains has generated multiple fanfics already.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS2E31RunningWithScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS2E31RunningWithScissors">"Running with Scissors"</a></em> as a major source of this. Marco spent sixteen years in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Year Inside, Hour Outside</a> dimension in this episode, so fans naturally explore the possibilities of all the adventures he must have had during that time. It's also popular to build off of the bittersweet mood of the ending, which implied that Marco would have a hard time readjusting to life on Earth, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">ended up not being the case</a>.
<ul><li> Another major source is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS2E32Mathmagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarVsTheForcesOfEvilS2E32Mathmagic">"Mathmagic".</a></em> Due to it making Alternate Universes canonical in the lore and world of Star Vs; and more importantly, makes it canonical that the characters are <em>aware</em> that there are Alternate Universes, both of which provided copious amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseFic">Alternate Universe Fic</a> fuel, especially ones that expanded upon the Alternate Universes already presented in the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em> has the train itself. Since it already has the mysterious ability to travel through dimensions, fans like to imagine that humans from the show's Earth aren't the only passengers on the train, and that it can be host to beings (both human and non-human) from various different timelines and dimensions. Cue half of the fics for the fandom consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">crossovers</a> with other works.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Who is Beezy's mother/Lucius' wife, and what happened to her? There <em>was</em> a Mrs. Heinous in the early stages of the series' development, but in the final product, she's Lucius' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> girlfriend Jez.
</li><li> How did Jimmy and Heloise end up in Miseryville? This was actually addressed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">the original pitch</a> (which was that Jimmy and Heloise died and went to Hell - by accident in the former's case), but since the final product makes its canonicity dubious, fans have often created their own theories in place, often with elements from the original concept.

Yes, this show has enough fanfic fuel to give it its own folder. The fanfiction community for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is <em>huge</em>, and they tend to latch onto any bit of ambiguity present in the show and movies as good starting points for fanfiction.
<p></p><ul><li> The main series:
<ul><li> Why are Celestia and Luna apparently the only winged unicorns in the series? This one has lost some prominence after the season 2 finale introduced Princess Cadence, and the season 3 finale made Twilight Sparkle into an "alicorn", which means Celestia and Luna are no longer as unique.
</li><li> Did anything interesting happen in the thousand years between Nightmare Moon's imprisonment and the pilot?
</li><li> Luna's 1-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>.
</li><li> Now we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/DaringDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/DaringDo">Daring Do</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a> who is the protagonist of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Book Series Within A Show</a>; the contents of one of the books have been shown on-screen, we know the title of another, and we know that there are many other books in the series. Cue lots of fan-made "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNameAndTheNounPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNameAndTheNounPhrase">Daring Do and the [x</a>]" installments. And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/DaringDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/DaringDo">Daring Do</a> trope page, if it counts.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E17HeartsAndHoovesDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E17HeartsAndHoovesDay">Hearts and Hooves Day</a>", the Cutie Mark Crusaders create a love potion, but they only use a very small amount and leave quite a bit in the pitcher. Cue Shipping Fics involving one pony (or more) accidentally drinking the potion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity ensuing</a>.
</li><li> The introduction of Tartarus and time travel spells in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E20ItsAboutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E20ItsAboutTime">It's About Time</a>" has given rise to many fanfics.
</li><li> The questionable actions of Shining Armor, The Mane Six, and Celestia that were taken during first part of the second season finale had garnered a bit of fuel, having writers insert bitterness into Twilight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she alienated everyone she ever loved, even when she was right about her suspicions surrounding the fake Cadance</span> and write out stories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccusationFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccusationFic">calling out the ponies involved</a>.
</li><li> During the space between seasons 2 and 3, Hasbro released a series of <em>Friendship is Magic</em> posters... including <a class="urllink" href="http://pixelkitties.deviantart.com/art/Hi-Resolution-Equestria-Map-318946279">an official map of Equestria<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which featured a number of new locales to tickle the imaginations of fanfic writers.
</li><li> Stories about multiple Pinkies already exist but the Mirror Pool now gives fans a canon method of creating clones.
</li><li> The mystery surrounding its existence and the accompanying book that was sealed away at the library.
</li><li> The idea of the remaining Pinkie being a clone or one of the clones getting missed in the roundup. A season six episode shows that at least one clone did escape.
</li><li> Babs Seed in general. Not only is she an Apple relative, she's also got a nice bit of background set up. She leaves at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E4OneBadApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E4OneBadApple">One Bad Apple</a> to start a Manehattan branch of the CMC, which on its own is prime Fanfic Fuel.
</li><li> The redeemed and nice Trixie will surely become more prominent than she already is now that it has become canon.
<ul><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">IDW comics</a>, an alternate universe version of Trixie became an Alicorn princess. This would imply that the main universe's Trixie has the same potential, even if she's never shown it yet.
</li></ul></li><li> Wait. You mean there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Amplifier Artifact</a> that can make a relative weakling like Trixie so powerful she outstrips the pre-ascension Twilight, but slowly corrupts the user to evil? Where did it come from, how was it made, how did Trixie find out about it? And it's now sitting in Zecora's hut where potentially anypony could find it or one of the cast could retrieve it and use it in a dire situation? The Alicorn Amulet is a tanker truck of fanfic fuel all by itself.
</li><li> The existence of an age modification spell lends itself to so many stories, even if only ponies like Celestia are powerful enough to use them.
<ul><li> While there's no confirmed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree">Rule 63</a> spell, the possibility one might exist is prime for fanfic (not that there aren't already numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OnACrossAndArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OnACrossAndArrow">Rule 63 works out there)</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Saddle Arabia and its inhabitants.
</li><li> Trixie knows Pinkie Pie's dad now!
</li><li> Zecora unambiguously has magical powers of her own.
</li><li> Now that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">reformed</a> Discord is officially canon, it should be useful to fanfic writers.
</li><li> Celestia said she found a use for Discord's magic, hence why she went about trying to get him reformed. Fanfic writers should have a field day working out whatever that use may be.
</li><li> Discord/Celestia shippers have their own ideas on why she wanted him reformed...
</li><li> Bulk Biceps', a.k.a. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Snowflake's</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> personality and his interactions with the mane six, especially Fluttershy, is prime shipping fuel.
</li><li> Soarin getting characterization in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E10RainbowFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E10RainbowFalls">Rainbow Falls</a>.
</li><li> Trailers for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E23InspirationManifestation">Inspiration Manifestation</a>" showing a green-eyed Rarity with her horn glowing the same color had fans wondering if King Sombra or Queen Chrysalis would be involved (they aren't). Given that all of Rarity's designs involve heavy use of crystals and gemstones and Twilight explicitly refers to the book's powers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">dark magic</a>, the episode looks to be implying that the book came from Sombra but backs off before stating it, leaving it open to speculation.
<ul><li> Given that the jewels were only a result of Rarity's design style and not part of the spell she used, they were probably a red herring as far as Sombra was concerned, but the gradual loss of reason and increase in power was similar to the effects of the Alicorn Amulet.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E24EquestriaGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E24EquestriaGames">Equestria Games</a>": Who are the delegates from other lands, and what are their kingdoms like? Plus, all the characters on the other teams, and what events the other ponies from Ponyville were participating in, and how the parts of the games that we didn't see (which were most of them) went, and Equestria's relationship with the griffon kingdom that sent a team (assuming it wasn't a griffon-majority territory located in Equestrian boundaries), and how the actual anthems of Ponyville and Cloudsdale go...
</li><li> As of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1">Twilights Kingdom - Part 1</a>", on top of fans tying the series back to G1 now more than ever, we have Scorpan, another G1 based character and Tirek's brother who befriended ponykind but left soon after Tirek was imprisoned. This is itself a reference to the <em>original</em> Scorpan, who also pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> against Tirek near the end of the G1 pilot. Oh yes, and Discord and Tirek know each other somehow.
<ul><li> And Scorpan and Star Swirl were friends?
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the villains in the show never got much development or backstory, so fanfic writers often seek to fill in the gaps. Chrysalis and Discord tend to be popular for this.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>" is set to blow up fanfic-writers everywhere with the sheer amount of story ideas it hinted at. What did "Bon Bon"/ Sweetie Drops do as a Special Agent under the service of Celestia? What, exactly, is the Bugbear and how did it escape from Tartarus (and, more importantly, what did it do to get sent there in the first place?) How did the Doctor get started on his life of science research in a setting obviously dominated by magic? What sort of adventures did Cranky Doodle and Steven Magnet have together? Why is there an undisguised Changeling at Cranky and Matilda's wedding?
</li><li> And then, there's Lyra. She's a popular background pony, but the wider fanon on her is pretty one-note compared to certain others. She sat like a human in a blink-and-miss moment, so she's treated as obsessed with humans, sometimes to the point of having no other personality traits or interests. However, her brief in-show appearances paint quite an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Hero of Another Story</a>: She knew Twilight back in Canterlot. She knows Cadence well enough to be one of her bridesmaids. The lyre cutie mark indicates a great musical talent. But she's not what you'd expect from one of the Canterlot elite - she now lives in Ponyville, and she's often seen hopping around with a big grin, to the point that she could give Pinkie Pie hyperactivity lessons. However, she was <em>very</em> cool and collected during "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E5MagicDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E5MagicDuel">Magic Duel</a>," sipping her hay shake and looking barely interested while a magical deathmatch was going on. You can bet that in the longer fanfics about her, this is mined for all it's worth.
</li><li> Any once-seen family member. Also, family members we <em>haven't</em> seen are their own kind of fanfic fuel - plenty of tragic stories about just why Apple Bloom is being raised by her grandma and siblings, and all manner of stories about why we haven't seen Scootaloo's parents, ranging from "they're horribly abusive and someone (usually Rainbow Dash) must rescue her" to "they're dead and Scoots lives in the CMC clubhouse" (these tend to end with justice done and the filly adopted by another character) to "Scootaloo is far more than she seems and doesn't <em>have</em> parents in the traditional sense" to how <em>normal</em> her life turns out to be after all the suspense being the punchline of the story.
</li><li> Maud's poetry. She states that she's written thousands of them. All about rocks. So naturally people decided to write their own.
</li><li> Yakyakistan, which is never shown.
</li><li> Magic is shown to be able to record video and sound during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E24TheManeAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E24TheManeAttraction">The Mane Attraction</a>.
</li><li> Sapphire Shores, according to Pinkie, is the second greatest pop star in all of Equestria. Rivalry between Sapphire and Coloratura ensues.
</li><li> Coloratura's time in Manehattan and how exactly she and Svengallop met, not to mention their working relationship and her rise to fame, are also ample fuel for fanfic writers.
</li><li> Applejack and Coloratura reflecting on their time in Friendship Camp. Prime fuel for writers who want to explore other characters going to summer camp now that it's canon in Equestria.
</li><li> Svengallop finding somepony else to exploit.
</li><li> The results of Countess Coloratura's rather drastic change in image has had its share of stories.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E12AmendingFences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E12AmendingFences">Amending Fences</a>" pretty much canonizes four more background ponies and adds them as supporting cast. Twilight's promise to return and visit them is an open book for stories.
</li><li> A spell that enables Twilight (or presumably any other pony) to appear in books is prime for fandom exploration.
</li><li> Apparently, not everyone in Canterlot lives the high life, and some live in rather dilapidated buildings, leaving open room for stories about class struggle in Canterlot.
</li><li> Meadowbrook apparently had eight famous magical relics attributed to her. Writers, get cracking!
</li><li> What Starlight Glimmer has been doing between the events of The Cutie Map and Amending Fences begs for exploration.
</li><li> The pony world has anime, or some sort of equivalent.
</li><li> The Season 5 finale, which featured <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timelines</a> created by Starlight Glimmer's attempts to alter history</span>, has already started spawning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">numerous takes on those alternate realities, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> scenarios for Twilight ultimately failing to stop Starlight</span>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem">A Royal Problem</a>" introduces an evil version of Celestia called Daybreaker. When Celestia dispels the nightmare containing Daybreaker, she says "No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!", which leads to three options: 1 - she's referring to Daybreaker being manifested in the dream, 2 - the last part of the statement is directed to Nightmare Moon, or 3 - Daybreaker somehow "existed" previously...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The thought of there being other mirrors that lead to different worlds other than a human world. Even as is, there's now an <em>excuse</em> for "Human in Equestria"/vice versa fanfics.
</li><li> Pretty much everything about Sunset Shimmer. The potential for any story about her is staggering, with her early childhood (Did she have a family or was she an orphan? If she had a family, what were they like?), time under Celestia (Was their relationship teacher/student or mother/daughter? Did they even perceive it the same way?), and her experiences in the human world prior to the beginning of <em>Equestria Girls</em> (How did she adjust and survive? How long has she even been there?) being gigantic blank slates, even after the sequels fleshed out her character a bit more.
</li><li> Both Pinkie and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Alternate Self</a> know of the existence of other worlds, and it's implied they share some kind of mind link. The potential there is just staggering...
</li><li> Those not turned off by Flash Sentry becoming Twilight's crush or his lack of character can now explore any potential backstory regarding him like what his relationship with Sunset was like before they broke up or explore his Equestrian counterpart's backstory or potential relationship with Twilight.
</li><li> The existence of a Twilight Sparkle native to the human world was this prior to her introduction in the post-credits scene of <em>Rainbow Rocks</em>. After that, focus shifted to the never-mentioned or alluded to native Sunset Shimmer, with stories ranging from those that have the cast finally meeting them to ones where we learned how she died.
</li><li> The existence of other villains (such as Nightmare Moon, Discord, and King Sombra) native to the human world.
</li><li> The identity of the mystery writer who sent Derpy the letter that made her blush has fueled endless speculation.
</li><li> Who were Trixie's and Derpy's bandmates?
</li><li> We don't see all the bands competing in a tournament that has 16 spots, so who might have been entered? What songs might they have played?
</li><li> Now that we know that magic <em>can</em> exist in the other world, and Star Swirl used it at least once to banish the Sirens there, who knows what other magical beings from Equestria have crossed over through the centuries? How many of them are still around?
</li><li> Twilight finding a way to easily return to the Equestria Girls world without relying on the "thirty-moons" time limit literally opens the door to more crossovers between the two worlds, as does Sunset being able to write back to Twilight.
</li><li> The Dazzlings were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reduced to normal girls</span> at the end of their movie, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">their fate was left hanging</a> until the final <em>Equestria Girls</em> special five years later. And even then, how they got to that point is still open to a lot of wiggle room in fan writing.
</li><li> The Dazzlings' backstories in Equestria, and whether they're friends, sisters, or what. Especially given that they're the closest thing we've gotten to a G4 version of the Sea Ponies.
</li><li> Since the Shadowbolts didn't get much screen time, but have given characteristics to them they are completely open to write about.
</li><li> Human Twilight and the rest of the Humane Seven's adventures.
</li><li> The many possible hilarious situations that would ensue with two Twilights.
</li><li> Unlike the statue/mirror portal, the magic portals opening up do not change people, leading to more canon possibilities for human-pony interactions.
</li><li> We get little characterization for Human Shining Armor beyond his pride in his performance in the past Games, leading to questions about just how he'd take <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight transferring to their school's arch-rival</span>.
<ul><li> Or even how miserable her sister was at Crystal Prep.
