But in fiction, the gun-hater's reasons are often different. He just specifically dislikes <em>guns</em>. He has no problem whatsoever with other, less efficient (and sometimes, <em>more</em> efficient) means of turning living people into non-living people.
</p><p>Sometimes there's a specific reason that their distaste is limited to the gun, such as a particular incident from his past or a sense that guns are "unsportsmanlike" or "cowardly". Some characters will even take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow">Heroic Vow</a> against the use of guns. But most of the time, there's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a> who wants to show that a character is moral enough to hate overt tools of violence like guns while glossing over the fact that they're in a show where a lot of violence has to be unloaded on people. Pressure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">reduce violence with firearms</a> in media in general, or the desire of an anti-gun author to teach us all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> may also play a part.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While other forms of lethal violence will still be lethal, they translate less literally to real life, since it's less probable anyone in the audience could successfully dish out pain the way the hero does. Not everyone is a master martial artist who can kill with their bare hands, but anyone with a functioning couple of fingers could conceivably pull a trigger and get lucky. This also allows the story to be more action-oriented and dramatic when guns could end the tension much quicker. (BANG!  "ooh, ya got me!")
</p><p>Most superpowered beings don't use guns, because frankly they don't need them. Why bother with a gun when you can already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBlast">shoot stuff out of your hands</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">eyes</a>, and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">mouth</a>?

</p><p>It's common for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> to not like guns, primarily because he <em>loves</em> fighting, and guns make fights end more quickly, which means less fun for him. He might also think guns are for cowards who are too chicken to fight up close and personal. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> as well, where, even if a Technical Pacifist still beats the crap out of people on a heartbeat, he will generally not use a gun.

<ul><li> Roger Smith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>, though its not much of a surprise since he's anime Batman. Though his reason is because it's not "gentleman"-like. He will use it if pressured, but won't directly attack people. And he's just fine with using the guns on his mecha. Again, just like Batman has no problem arming <em>his</em> vehicles with enough guns and explosives to take out a small country.
</li><li> Yajiro Kojima from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier">Grenadier</a></em> uses a sword instead of guns because he thinks a person who kills with a gun doesn't feel the weight of the life he or she takes. Traveling with Rushuna makes him rethink that point, though.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">Takamachi family</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever">Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever</a></em> despise guns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords">only use swords</a>. Which puts Kyoya Takamachi at odds with Ellis McGaren, who despises swords and only uses guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>:
<ul><li> This may be why Shenhua doesn't use guns. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">far too fond of the knives</a>.
</li><li> Also Rock — he'd rather use words. In the yakuza arc, he refuses the pistol Balalaika offers him as a souvenir, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after killing several former allies with it on his more or less indirect suggestion</span>, but says he "won't forget that he pulled the trigger". Of course, if there's any shooting to be done, Revy's happy to do it for him.

<ul><li> Aiber hates guns, and violence in general. But then, he <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMenHateGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMenHateGuns">con man.</a> Interestingly, he is very skilled with a firearm, as he demonstrates when he reluctantly picks one up chasing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Higuchi</span>. We're only told that he dislikes guns for personal reasons, and those reasons are never elaborated on.
</li><li> Light and his father both staunchly refuse to accept guns offered to them for their personal safety because they are civilians, and it is illegal in Japan for civilians to carry a firearm. They seem to take a national pride in following this rule.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">manga</a>, Ed says that he doesn't like guns and freaks out when he has to use one; this is consistent with his refusal to kill anyone throughout the series.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> handles this differently, as while Ed starts the series with the same attitude, it gradually abates as subsequent events take a toll on his innocence. In the latter parts of the anime he starts using firearms in fights (at one point he even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">transmuted a machine gun onto his automail arm</a>), and by the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">the Movie</a> he keeps a pistol stashed in his belongings. He's a lousy shot however, and still prefers to use his fists over guns.
</li><li> Inverted with Riza Hawkeye, who says she prefers guns to swords and knives because with guns, "The sense of death doesn't linger on the hands." But as Roy says, she isn't being truthful. Snipers kill in a very personal way, even if they aren't physically close to their victims.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">End of Evangelion</a></em>, after Shigeru Aoba hands Maya Ibuki a gun, she expresses dislike of using guns and killing human beings even as NERV is being invaded by SDF.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shigeru Aoba:</strong> <em>[hands Ibuki a gun]</em> Release the safety. <br/><strong>Maya Ibuki:</strong> I can't! I just can't shoot this thing, Aoba! <br/><strong>Shigeru Aoba:</strong> Of course you can! You've had basic training! <br/><strong>Maya Ibuki:</strong> But I shot at targets, not at other human beings! <br/><strong>Shigeru Aoba:</strong> Idiot! You kill or you die!

The reason, as revealed later, is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually a crack shot, but that caused him to become overconfident and do gun tricks at the shooting range; one of those tricks went awry, and <em>he shot himself in the leg</em>, causing him to start disliking firearms.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>:
<ul><li> On a related note, Prince Philionel and his daughter<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">s Naga and</span> Amelia, who Don't Like Swords, and as such are mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> martial artists.

The backstory for the anime also revealed that most martial artists were quite pissed off at the inclusion of guns because Gentle Chapman of Neo-England won three straight Gundam Fights just by sniping them. It was Master Asia's win that saved the fights.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">Kimba</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em> due to the deaths (including his father) guns cause in his animal kingdom.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Batman's hatred of the gun is well known, so much that he, as Bruce Wayne, bars his company from producing military contracts (uh...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">huh</a>...) and will refuse to use a firearm even if it seems to be the only way out of a deadly situation. This is carried over into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a> as well, possibly best shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> when what finally pushed Batman to retire is that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">forced to use a gun</a> to threaten a kidnapper who was about to bash in his skull after he had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">crippled by a bad heart attack during the fight</a>.
<ul><li> Technically the military contracts thing isn't true, as we've seen various examples of military-grade hardware produced by WayneTech, from night vision goggles to attack helicopters. Presumably Bruce is fine with it as long as his company isn't manufacturing any weapon systems (those can be sourced from other contractors). Bruce tends to outsource a lot of WayneTech's R&amp;D to other DCU corporations; he tends to use external tech more in the comics than, in, say, the Nolanverse.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a></em> comic book (Volume 2, Issue 33) features a flashback with Batman and Robin (the younger Nightwing) on the firing range in the Batcave. Robin is surprised when Batman hands him a gun:
<div class="indent"><strong>Robin:</strong> <em>[holds revolver straight up, finger safely off the trigger]</em> I thought you hated guns. <br/><strong>Batman:</strong> <em>[inspecting the rest of the guns on the table]</em> But I don't fear them. There's a big difference. They're used against us so often we need to know them, respect them. You need to know how they work. To know even more than the punks who rely on them.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin III (Tim Drake)</a>, likewise, gives this same explanation after a special ops member mentions while he beat her in a sparring match, she'd have an edge on the firing range. He also adds that part of the reason they don't use guns is, unlike police, they can't appear in court to defend the use of lethal force, so they don't use tools (like guns) that would result in deaths. After Dick became a Bludhaven police officer, Bruce made it clear that he didn't like him wearing his service revolver around the cave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em> takes this to a symbolical level as Batman makes an "once in a lifetime" exception and <strike>shoots</strike> "poisons" Darkseid <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with an anti-New God gun only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">"killed"</a> by the villain's eye beams a mere second after pulling the trigger</span>. Much to the chagrin of fans, though it should be noted that Batman was going for a what could be a suicide run (as this <em>was</em> the "Day That Evil Won" and was most likely the last thing he could have done being trapped in Command-D) and of all places, Batman shot Darkseid <strong>in the shoulder</strong>. With a bullet that was, as he himself pointed out, like Kryptonite to Darkseid's kind. All that means is that instead of dying instantly Darkseid's body took a few moments to savour the poisonous effects.
</li><li> In another Batman story by Grant Morrison, <em>Joe Chill in Hell</em>, a young Batman confronts his parents' killer, Joe Chill, and torments the man, depriving him of sleep, sneaking up on him in disguise, and generally just scaring the crap out of him for a month, all building up to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Batman drives Chill to commit suicide</a>.
</li><li> It's amazing how strict some Batman adaptations are about this, even when you'd think they'd ditch it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkKnightReturns">The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>, Batman hospitalizes countless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, snaps the Joker's spine (paralyzing but not killing him), and even has machine guns on his car. When he uses the guns, he internal monologues to the reader, "Rubber Bullets. Honest."
<ul><li> Except in that same comic, Batman uses a captured M60 on one of the Mutants terrorizing the city. Though, to his credit, he only fired <em>around</em>, not directly at the mutant.
</li></ul></li><li> The reasons vary from writer to writer. Originally, the idea that Batman hates guns was linked to his parents' murder when he was a child. There are practical and legal reasons, too — self-awareness that he's a vigilante and the knowledge that in being so he has no business killing, while guns make it much too easy to kill and much too hard to be nonlethal. On a historical note, in his original Detective Comic appearances, he frequently used firearms and lethal force against villains. The creators only removed his use of firearms when they worried that it would make him resemble the Shadow too closely. Today, most depictions have Batman bending enough to arm his vehicles, for disabling vehicles and removing obstacles of course.
</li><li> In a particularly amusing inversion, in an early Detective Comics appearance Bats comments that he hates taking human life — immediately before machine-gunning a car full of baddies from his biplane. <a class="urllink" href="http://sacomics.blogspot.com/2005/08/batman-and-guns.html">This blog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a good rundown on instances where he used a gun.
</li><li> In fact, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a>, he didn't even have the "dislikes guns" angle, and in his first few months of publication had a handgun that he wasn't afraid to use.
</li><li> While Batman's aversion to guns has generally grown over time, there are some situations in the older comics where Batman refuses to use a gun. In Detective 453 (the same series in which Batman fires a machine gun into a car full of bad guys), Batman is told to shoot a single bullet into the ground to prove he isn't really Batman, or be shot to death by a room full of criminals. He doesn't do it. This is probably due more to the inconsistency of older comics and a lazy writer, but it's probably the most extreme example of this rule.
</li><li> In one issue of the <em>Justice League</em>, shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> had been blinded in battle in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">her own comic</a>, the League was testing to see if she was still up to membership standards. As she was cheerfully thrashing the Flash, Green Lantern, and several others, Batman is seen off to the side talking with Superman. A few panels later, Wonder Woman has to use her bracelets to block a bullet...fired by Superman. As incongruous as it is to see Superman holding a gun, he has no actual problem with them (and was probably trained to use them on the Kent farm), while Batman couldn't bring himself to fire one even as a deliberately non-lethal test.
</li><li> While Batman does not use guns, Alfred does. Alfred Pennyworth has threatened or actually shot numerous people throughout comics history with pistols, rifles, and shotguns. Most notably, it is Alfred who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills the Penguin</span> in Batman Earth 1. The apparent justification is twofold. First is that Alfred, in his mid-sixties, is unable to fight on a competitive level. Second is that Batman trusts Alfred's judgement implicitly, which he does not for the Robins, and certainly does not trust himself.
</li><li> Batman's distaste for guns gets talked about in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">JLA</a>/WildCATS</em> crossover, in which the League hooks up with the premiere heroes of Jim Lee's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm">WildStorm</a> line. At one point when both teams go up against Epoch the Time Lord, Batman asks the raygun-toting Grifter just how good he is. When Grifter brags that in his universe Batman would have been <em>his</em> kid sidekick, Batman then adds, "Then you won't mind doing this without the guns." Grifter pauses for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>, then quips, "Aw, why not? I'll try anything once!" The beginning of the crossover features an encounter with Epoch and Wally West while he was still Kid Flash, who sizes up his new foe's huge high-tech rifle by commenting, "One of the first things I've learned in the superhero game. 'Gun' equals 'bad guy'."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> used this as a plot point in the final episode. Bat-Mite is trying to get the series cancelled and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmbushBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmbushBug">Ambush Bug</a> attempts to stop him, but Batman refuses to listen when Bug tells him that the world has been changed (which includes some glaringly obvious changes, such as the addition of a bunch of silly gadgets, Batman having a wife and child, and a dog sidekick modeled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scrappy Doo</a>). That is, until Batman uses a pair of handguns to fight crime, which Bug points out is an <strong>insanely</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Out-of-Character Moment</a>; at this point Batman finally realizes that Bug is right and starts fighting back against Bat-Mite.
</li><li> Jason Todd was taught how to use guns by Batman, while at the same time acknowledging Bruce's own aversion to guns. And even used a live gun, at least once, in order to escape, by forcing their assailants to take cover. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheCult">Batman: The Cult</a></em>, Batman and Jason use rifles and machine-guns that fire tranquilizer darts that otherwise function nearly identically to normal firearms.
<ul><li> At another point, Jason Todd uses a shotgun to destroy a Commissioner Gordon Manhunter impersonator (no, really) and save Batman. He doesn't have much of a reaction to this besides "good work, Robin".
</li></ul></li><li> In Mike Mignola's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">The Doom That Came to Gotham</a></em>, the Waynes are killed by knife, and Batman freely uses guns, though he never actually shoots anyone. He does have an aversion to knives, though.
</li><li> Depending on how you look at it, Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">grappling gun</a> is an aversion.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Barbara Gordon</a> doesn't like guns, which makes sense since she was shot by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> and was left paralyzed from the waist down in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>. This event remains in her backstory post-Flashpoint, and it's left its mark on her, as seen in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011">current series</a>. One of her first attempts to get back into the swing of things as Batgirl (her paralysis was treated with surgery overseas) goes poorly when Mirror pulls a gun on her (aiming at the <em>exact same spot where the Joker shot her</em>) and she freezes in fear.
<ul><li> There is a point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em> where she prepares to kill Black Mask with a sniper rifle to prevent him from attacking her clock tower, but Barbara's sometimes portrayed as more pragmatic than other members of the bat family.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBatmanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBatmanAdventures">Gotham Adventures</a></em>, a tie-in comic to the animated series, Barbara has no aversion to guns, given her police training and the lack of any event analogous to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>; she simply doesn't use them as Batgirl to respect Batman's wishes. However, when the time comes to infiltrate the home base of the Sensei, one of the world's most lethal martial artists and the leader of the League of Assassins, she makes a point of holding onto a pistol. Batman isn't happy with this decision, but ultimately does nothing to stop her besides arguing.
</li></ul></li><li> One Batman related character, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a>, is willing to kill and uses a crossbow and throwing knives to get the job done. Unlike most other examples, she doesn't avoid guns because she looks down on them, she's stated that she's just not very good with them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Nite Owl says that Rorschach didn't shoot Moloch because that way of killing someone is too <em>ordinary</em>. Presumably this is why Rorschach chose to improvise when he is cornered by the police instead of picking up the gun. The gun was also empty, and Rorschach only kills criminals; crazy as he is, he doesn't bear ill will against police officers, and only fights them at all in order to escape.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> is mostly nonchalant about guns, they're used as part of a reaction time improving <em>game</em> back home in her Golden Age appearances where Amazons play "bullets and bracelets" where they shoot at each other and deflect the bullets, she dislikes them more post-crisis where there are no guns on Themyscira. She however always hates that they're a weapon without any realistic non-lethal applications outside her home island and will often crush guns tossed her way if they're not going to be needed for a criminal investigation later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> villain Kraven the Hunter disdained the use of guns and rarely even used a bow and arrows during most of his career, preferring to hunt his prey, whether it's wild animals or costumed heroes like Spidey, on equal terms. Ironically, after succumbing to insanity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">he used a firearm on himself to take his own life.</a> In fact, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KravensLastHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KravensLastHunt">that very storyline</a>, Spidey freaks out when he sees Kraven approaching him with a rifle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">noting how unlike him it is</a>.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Tombstone, another Spider-Man villain. While he has used a gun from time to time, he much prefers to kill his victims, who are usually much weaker than he is, with his bare hands, most often by strangulation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)</a></em>:
<ul><li> The turtles notice on several occasions in the comics that they hate guns. At one point where they use some as a part of disguise Leonardo points out that he do not want any shooting and another of the turtles have already unloaded his gun. And in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAdventures">Archie comic</a> they think that lasers may be cool but also boring and too effective.
</li><li> Raphael is the only one to break the rule — twice in fact. The first time is in the Image series, where he guns down several gangsters. The second is in the Archie comics, where he uses a laser gun to shoot a villain, who survives.
<ul><li> Actually, they do use guns on several occasions in the first volume of the Mirage comics, either laser guns or regular lead spewing ones. They don't intentionally bring guns to a fight, but they're perfectly willing to pick one up if the situation demands it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Nny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a></em> never kills with a gun (with only one exception, though that was for a murder-suicide). His stance on it is that they should only be used on oneself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bullseye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bullseye">Bullseye</a> doesn't like guns because they're boring. He'd much rather kill someone with a playing card, or a shuriken, or his own poop. Which isn't to say he'll never use them. During the "Guardian Devil" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> arc, Bullseye admitted that Daredevil was "almost" his better, so he decided to subvert his principles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">shot Daredevil</a>. He also tried to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> with a rocket launcher. It didn't work because...it's <em>Deadpool</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a> also doesnt use guns all that much, preferring to take out enemies with his fists. He does have a laser in his cane, but he doesnt use it frequently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ModestyBlaise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ModestyBlaise">Modesty Blaise</a>'s sidekick Willie Garvin. His case is a bit special, since he only dislikes handguns, and only dislikes <em>them</em> because he thinks they inspire overconfidence (though his terrible pistol marksmanship might be a factor too...). He has used rifles and shotguns to great effect on multiple occasions, but he prefers thrown weapons. His weapons of choice are knives, but he has also included short pieces of pipe, boomerangs, and large coins to great effect. (If a handgun is all he has, he's been known to throw it.)
</li><li> Detective-Judge Armitage, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> spin-off character. His general attitude is deconstruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>: he absolutely refuses to carry or use a gun, but has no qualms about, for instance, broken bottles. However, it is stated that Detective-Judges don't carry firearms generally. There was a more recent story where Armitage did carry a gun on a raid.
</li><li> This trope holds true for several of the heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme">Squadron Supreme</a>,</em> and leads them to ban and destroy all guns as part of their Utopia Project. The trope later causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> for one character when, in a panic, he grabs an automatic weapon and opens fire on a team of villains.
</li><li> In the Italian comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em>, the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> never uses a gun. Not from having issues with killing (he'll immediately kill you if he thinks it's useful), but because their noise tend to give away the stealth element he always counts on and he's way better with knives.
</li><li> Steve Rogers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> averts this considering he originally did not have a problem carrying a pistol along with his original triangular shield. He drops the side arm later because he finds that his newer circular shield is so useful as a weapon that he decides that is typically the only one he needs most of the time.
</li><li> Mr. X, formerly of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em>, is an... interesting case. He doesn't like guns because he thinks they aren't personal enough; he's a peerless killer who forms an empathic bond with his victims, relishing the moment of their deaths, so up-close killing is extremely important to him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a> frequently uses guns, but admits at one point that he's never entirely comfortable with the idea of handling one.

Later, after realizing what really killed his parents, Bruce's approach eschews guns because they represent that wrong minded mindset of vengeance <em>he</em> once had.
</li><li> On the other side, the Joker claims he doesn't like guns because they make things end too quickly, and prefers knives, so that he may savor the reactions of his victims. Then again, he is personally shown using guns during several of his attacks, including pistols, shotguns, and rocket launchers.

</li><li> However, she's perfectly alright with using crossbows, which <em>are</em> effective against vampires.
</li><li> On the other hand, there was one case where a <em>bazooka</em> was rather useful in the Buffyverse. "What's that do?"
</li><li> Of course the Slayer, not being bullet proof, has a vested interest in preventing gun play from breaking out.

Of course, as she acknowledges, Angel (who's also a vampire) will not die from being shot, but it will still hurt like hell.

This was before he found out they were the ones responsible for wiping out a number of friendly demons, which proved the weapons effective if nothing else.
</li><li> The RPG comments about guns in the Buffy-verse: they're not too effective against vampires, your primary foes, and they make a lot of noise and leave a lot of evidence, making them sub-optimal in your secret war against the forces of evil.

</li><li> In Season 8, the one time Buffy allows the other Slayers to arm up when the army is gunning for them, she still refuses to use one herself.

He probably doesn't have great depth-perception anyway, considering his glass eye. He seems to have no problem brandishing one on Mo Weinberg in "Undercover" though, but Weinberg does try to shoot him. In "Butterfly in Shades of Grey", the killer sees Columbo without his famous trenchcoat and notes that he doesn't carry a gun, so tries to shoot him later on. Columbo calmly points out that he might not be armed, but he's not alone. He honks the horn on his car and two police officers turn up to arrest the killer.

</div><ul><li> John Blackwolf, the guest cop in the episode "The Tribe", dislikes guns, and dislikes Hotch because he carries two of them. During the climax, he insists Hotch use his baton against the titular tribe, while he uses... a knife. When Hotch does end up shooting one of the killers, Blackwolf scoffs. Hotch then points out that Blackwolf cut up another one badly enough that he's unlikely to survive either, and repeats a line Blackwolf had used earlier: "You can take many paths to get to the same place."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Deadwood">Deadwood</a></em>: Frontier crime boss Al Swearengen is a self-professed "terrible shot" and sticks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">throat-slashing</a>. In season three, however, he realizes that his reluctance has become a liability and laments never learning to shoot properly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: The Doctor doesn't like guns. In the vast majority of stories he does not handle guns, even when they are available, and even on the odd occasion that the enemy is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>. He does use a variety of super-science methods that usually turn out to be no less lethal. For example, he often uses his sonic screwdriver as a projectile weapon. When he does use a gun, it's usually to show that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> has been crossed or do something besides shoot directly at the enemy. At times the justification has been made that if you have a gun and an enemy, your inclination is to use the gun to kill your enemy, while he'd prefer to see if there's another way first. Examples and exceptions include:
<ul><li> From 1966 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">Western</a> serial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E8TheGunfighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E8TheGunfighters">"The Gunfighters"</a>: "All these people are giving me guns  I do wish they wouldn't."
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor <em>does</em> like guns, oddly. He blew away a Fendahleen with a shotgun in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E3ImageOfTheFendahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E3ImageOfTheFendahl">"Image of the Fendahl"</a>. (Loaded with rock salt, granted  but he didn't have any way of knowing the load had been changed, and it was <em>still</em> a lethal shot.) He also has no issues with blasting the giant rat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E6TheTalonsOfWengChiang">"The Talons of Weng-Chiang"</a>, saying several admiring things about the Chinese fowling piece he uses, calling it "the most fearsome piece of hand-artillery in all England" and pooh-poohing Litefoot's dire prediction that the gun would explode on firing, saying, "Explode? Unthinkable! It was made in Birmingham!" On the other hand, he also says "I never carry firearms" when offered a rifle in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars">"Pyramids of Mars"</a>, and tells Leela "I never carry weapons. If people see you mean them no harm, they never hurt you. Nine times out of ten", in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E5TheRobotsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E5TheRobotsOfDeath">The Robots of Death</a>". When Sarah Jane sees him packing a pistol in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom">The Seeds of Doom</a>", she points out he'd never actually use it and he agrees.
</li><li> The Fifth Doctor blasted the hell out of the Cyberleader with his own weapon in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E6Earthshock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E6Earthshock">Earthshock</a>", and shot an uncased Dalek with a common gun in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E4ResurrectionOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E4ResurrectionOfTheDaleks">Resurrection of the Daleks</a>".

(Five of the six stories mentioned here for Five and Six were the five stories written by Eric Saward, including the four where he actually used the gun on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">living-ish beings</a>.)
</li><li> The Seventh Doctor is perfectly willing to empty a clip of silver bullets into one of the nasties from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E1Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E1Battlefield">Battlefield</a>". And from his reaction post-sucker punch, this <em>isn't</em> a plot to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrigadier">Lethbridge-Stewart</a> to take the job instead.
</li><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> in the reboot series. Since his seventh life was cut short from a stray bullet because he landed the TARDIS in the wrong part of San Francisco, later incarnations have a lot more reason to dislike firearms and the United States.
</li><li> The very first thing the War Doctor is seen to do after first regenerating from the Eighth is to grab a gunbelt, complete with bullets. This is what indicates to the audience <em>why</em> that incarnation was such a pariah that later ones had trouble speaking of him. We also see him use it, not to shoot enemies, but to graffiti "No More!" on a burned-out wall in the middle of a battlefield. One Gallifreyan soldier put it bluntly to Rassilon: "There was a saying, sir, in the Time War. The first thing you notice about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron">The Doctor of War</a> is that he isn't armed. For many, it's also the last."
</li><li> The Ninth Doctor carries a gun in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E6Dalek">Dalek</a>". Granted, he ends up not using it, and he is up against the enemy that he had a special, deep-rooted hatred for. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E12BadWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E12BadWolf">"Bad Wolf"</a>, an enraged Ninth Doctor brandishes a giant gun, but when a frightened underling throws up his hands and says "don't shoot!" the Doctor tosses the gun to the man and says "oh, don't be so thick. Like I was ever gonna shoot!"

When Luke Rattigan tries to hold him at gunpoint, the Doctor simply takes the gun out of Luke's hand and throws it away (without breaking stride), muttering, "If I see <em>one more</em> gun..." The UNIT Colonel eventually gets fed up with Ten's anti-gun speeches and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKirk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKirk">tells him off</a> before attacking conventionally and handing the Sontarans their collective ass.

She insists that the tools that he <em>does</em> use would still classify as weapons, so the distinction is arbitrary. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">The End of Time</a>", the Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">borrows Wilf's old service revolver</a> when he realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Time Lords are escaping the time lock</span>, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ultimately only uses it to destroy a machine</span>.

Amy is able to talk him down, however, and the gun is never fired.
</li><li> Eleven also admits that he "shouldn't" like River's blatant use of guns as primary tools, but does.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(who at that point had been tortured by the Time Lords for billions of years and has undergone some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>) uses a stolen Gallifreyan sidearm in "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">Hell Bent</a>" to shoot and kill the General, in order for him and Clara to escape a situation, but only after asking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">how many regenerations</a> the General has left (turns out he was on his ninth).</span>

This Doctor hates guns <em>very specifically</em> for unexplained reasons, but seems comfortable with violence in general; she's fine with taking out those same robots with an EMP, and later in the episode massacres an attacking monster swarm by burning them to death. She also chews out Jack Robertson in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E4ArachnidsInTheUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E4ArachnidsInTheUK">"Arachnids in the UK"</a> when he shoots the giant (and already dying) spider to death.

She later tells her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a> Clyde that guns rarely solve problems without worsening them first. That said, we know from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars">Pyramids of Mars</a>" that she's a pretty decent shot with a rifle.
</li><li> This brings up a good point. The Doctor may not like guns very much, but recurring enemy Davros pointed out that the Doctor has no issue with their <em>companions</em> firing the guns if it comes down to it.

This especially became an issue in the season six two-part finale "Fallen Heroes": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first part had him unable to shoot a suspect who participated in a shootout in the headquarters, killing three and wounding two, and the second part had him unable to shoot another suspect who was about to fire on him.

<ul><li> This trope was subject to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: the pilot episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a> has Mac using a stolen assault rifle to lay down cover fire while rescuing a captured US airman. However, Mac generally doesn't like guns; the episode "Blood Brothers" explained that this was due to a childhood incident where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">he accidentally shot one of his friends</a>. He has no problems with using them as impromptu tools, however (such as when he took a revolver, removed the bullet cylinder part, and used the frame as a improvised wrench to close a needed valve), or as some sort of Rube Goldbergian "something to make a loud noise to distract the bad guys" device.
</li><li> At times his aversion bordered on the ridiculous: Once, to open a door that was locked, Mac dismantled a bullet, filled the keyhole with the gunpowder, inserted the blasting cap, then hit the cap with the butt of the gun, igniting the gunpowder and blowing up the lock. A solution that (as demonstrated on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em>) was not only impractical but pointless, as that particular kind of lock was the kind that easily broke open when shot.
</li><li> Parodied by RDA himself in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> when requesting a list of "common items" by which he could make his next daring escape from the clutches of Patty and Selma. These items included both a gun with no bullets...and <em>bullets</em>!
</li><li> In the episode "The Challenge", MacGyver almost uses a pistol for its primary purpose. He pulls a pistol on a man who had murdered his friend, but someone snapped him out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> As seen in the quote from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, Hawkeye is opposed to using guns. At one point, Colonel Potter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">gives Hawkeye an earful</a> for his stubbornness and <em>orders</em> him to fire his pistol. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">In obedience to the order,</a> Hawkeye fires the pistol into the air. Thankfully, Potter just wanted Hawkeye to let off a shot in order to scare away the soldiers attacking them.
<ul><li> Potter himself is willing to <em>use</em> one, but he himself admits later that he's not good with it, and couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. In fact, this holds true for most of the regular cast. Even the usually gung-ho Major Burns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">was hopeless when he actually tried to use one.</a> Given that all the above characters and a majority of the M*A*S*H cast are medical personnel, not frontline soldiers, the lack of skill and love for guns makes sense.
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nichols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nichols">Nichols</a></em> was a soldier for 18 years who gradually became sick of killing.

Reese, a former Army Ranger and ex-CIA covert operative, agrees that he doesn't either, but "My philosophy is, if someone has to have them, I'd rather it was me." Later in the episode Reese tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> Lionel Fusco that he doesn't like killing people but he's very good at it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaPatrol">Sea Patrol</a></em>, Bird hates guns. After being hunted across an island for sport by two armed men when a survival exercise goes wrong, she shoots one bad guy with his own rifle, but still insists upon hating guns. One has to wonder how she (or some other characters, for that matter) came to join the <em>Royal Australian Navy</em>.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SirArthurConanDoylesTheLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SirArthurConanDoylesTheLostWorld">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World</a></em>, Roxton fights a ninja, and is getting his ass handed to him. When he tries to draw his gun, the ninja knocks it away and says, "Guns are a coward's weapon."
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, security chief Odo never carries a phaser for moral and practical reasons.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, Bretonnian knights live by an all-encompassing code of chivalry that disdains missile weapons of all kinds as base, cowardly and ignoble. None of them would dream of using a bow, crossbow or handgun himself, but most are tactically savvy enough to let their peasant retainers bring longbows and trebuchets to battle for support. Some, however, take the knightly disdain for such weapons to extreme heights of religious hatred for enemy missile troops, which is represented in the game by allowing Bretonnian knightly characters to buy this as a virtue. It does however transfer to all ranged weapons and not only guns. The basic code of conduct for Bretonnian knights in <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> includes a ban on gunpowder weapons. In fact, none of the knight careers grant proficiency in them. The knightly virtue in question only adds a ban on all ranged weapons on top of it. Averted completely with the Bretonnian navy, as there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Ain't No Rule</a> banning ranged weapons outside of noble levies outside of Brettonian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">soil</a>, so they toss cannonballs around like candy. In fact, the Navy is trying to get the crossbow ban (levies are only equipped with normal bows) clarified to specifically crossbows (and not implicitly assumed to encompass guns as well) and thus allowing the naval bases to be equipped with cannon.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>: While taking out servants of the False Emperor from a nice safe distance by aiming for the biggest hat is sure to work, it won't get you points from the Dark Gods since there's no risk involved (except maybe Tzeentch, and as the god of sorcerers, cowards and backstabbers he's even more likely to screw you over). Servants of Khorne, the most kill-happy of the lot, can carry guns, but if they're going to gather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">skulls for the skull throne</a> they'd better get closer. Amusingly enough, Khorne does have a gun unit (a cannon, specfically) that fires skulls. Averted with the Iron Warriors, who are siege specialists and are appropriately very pro gun. Generally averted as well, with even dedicated close combat units that are not alien monsters or daemons usually carrying at least a pistol and grenades (including the aforementioned Chaos combat units).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em>, the Archangel David hates all ranged weapons (including guns) because he feels they separate a person from the reality of what they're doing.

Brock Samson doesn't seem to be a huge fan of 'em, going so far as to outright refuse to even touch one during his OSI exam. Later seasons justify it as his attempt to avoid escalating things with the Guild by limiting his weapon and is not above using things like grappling guns or paintball guns. That isn't to say that Brock is less dangerous without a gun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">because he's not</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhereOnEarthIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhereOnEarthIsCarmenSandiego">Carmen Sandiego</a> prides herself on using stealth, cunning and high-tech gadgetry to accomplish her criminal activities and considers the use of any brute force, especially firearms, to be unsporting. Add to that the fact that she actively strives to avoid any collateral damage to anyone in her operations, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">ACME Junior Detectives</a> sent to apprehend her.
</li><li> After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> where he almost kills Elisa by accidentally shooting her with her own gun, this becomes a defining trait for Broadway. In an interesting case, his hatred of them stems from his own misfire rather than the weapon itself; Goliath obliquely mentions in the first episode that the gargs obviously don't have problems killing invaders (like the Vikings) if they can't avoid it. Broadway <em>will</em>, however, leave guns be in the hands of responsible people like Elisa — he only destroys those their enemies (usually petty criminals) are using because <em>they</em> use them to hurt people. The moral of the episode <em>wasn't</em> "guns are bad", it was "guns need to be handled responsibly", something both Broadway and Elisa agree upon at episode's end, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Elisa always locks her gun away from that point on</a>, to emphasize not leaving it around where someone who is irresponsible or ill-intentioned can reach it.
</li><li> An amusing scene in the American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> animated series had Guile given a license to acquire weapons. Being a manly man, he crushes it in his fist and declares "Guns are for wimps!" Just a reminder, Guile is in the <em>U.S. Army</em>. Other depictions of him never show him hating guns, though since the series is all about hand-to-hand combat, it's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> than anything else. Then again, per the rules for the <em>Street Fighter</em> RPG (and mentioned in the infamous Murphy's Rules column), Guile doesn't know HOW to use the things. For extra irony, the Street Fighter action figure line that was being produced at the time and based on the cartoon gave all the figures, Guile included, massive guns and missile launchers (the action figures were produced by Hasbro and reused accessories from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> toys).

<ul><li> As mentioned above, Batman (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>) hates guns, and goes into retirement after being forced to use one as a last resort. Bruce Wayne, though, is seen in one episode participating in target shooting. Well, he does have to keep those Grapple-Gun skills sharp.
</li><li> Bruce Wayne invokes the trope by name in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "The World's Finest", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> tries to persuade Bruce to allow him use the robots they were developing together for military purposes. Bruce tells him "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologicalPacifist">I don't like guns</a>".
</li><li> There's a very interesting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> episode, "Dead Reckoning", in which Deadman possesses Batman and kills Devil Ray with a gun (in a split second reaction to save Wonder Woman's life). Batman is visibly disgusted afterwards at having any part in killing someone with a gun, even to save a friend.
</li><li> It's subverted in an episode taking place in an altered timeline — a resistance fighter Batman grabs a gun and points it at the League, thoroughly convincing them that something has changed the timeline.
</li><li> In the <em>Justice League</em> finale, Luthor offers Batman his spare pistol when he runs out of batarangs. Batman declines, saying "Not my style."
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures">Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures</a></em>. Johnny and Jessie have cornered a bad guy who drops his gun. The villain worries for a moment that Jonny will pick up the gun and use it, but Jonny tells him that he doesn't like guns. The villain smirks...for a second, until Jessie points the gun at his head, saying "I, on the other hand, don't have a problem with them."

After finishing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, she'd joined Handgun Control, and was <em>not</em> thrilled with the emphasis on weaponry in the third film script. In the final script, there are no firearms (albeit coincidentally).
</li><li> Legendary Hawaiian police officer Chang Apana never carried a gun, but managed to be quite the badass anyway.
</li><li> Many James Bond actors have stated that they dislike guns, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore">Roger Moore</a> disliked handling guns so much that he often used a stunt double when the script called for him to fire one.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardGRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardGRobinson">Edward G. Robinson</a> also hated guns. That was a problem early in his career, since he was often typecast as a gangster. During production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleCaesar">Little Caesar</a></em>, Robinson's eyelids had to be taped open so he wouldn't flinch when he fired his weapon.

</li><li> Britain in general seems to dislike guns in the hands of private citizens - for instance, it has one of the strictest regimes of gun control in the world. While pistols are not outright prohibited for civilians contrary to popular belief, they are restricted compared to many other countries and have to meet certain cosmetic requirements such as a long barrel length and wire stock,(the British Olympic Pistol Shooting team has to train abroad, and there was some controversy over the lifting of normal rules for the 2012 London Olympics) and shotguns and rifles are regulated to almost the same degree. Similarly, it is a point of great pride for many British people that Britain is the only industrial country of its size which does not regularly arm its police force (though it does have SO19, the Firearms Squad, the British equivalent of SWAT, for such occasions when they are needed), and even when members of the police are killed by armed crooks (something which is noticeably rare), both police and public are overwhelmingly against equipping bobbies on the beat with guns. Even criminals seem to prefer knives, if only to make their dirty deeds less likely to attract attention. An exception is the bobbies in Northern Ireland, who are always armed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">for obvious reasons</a>.
<ul><li> Television personality Piers Morgan is most likely the perfect example of the anti gun sentiment in Britain, who regularly debates Americans and criticizes their gun laws (without consulting American opinions).
</li><li> A worse issue is that British gun bans were partially based on depictions of guns in movies. Revolver-type shotguns were banned owing to a depiction of one being used as a <em>tank-destroying superweapon</em>, which obviously no weapon of that type could be in reality.
</li><li> It is interesting to note that the strong anti-gun sentiment in the present day UK is a relatively recent phenomenon, until the trend in gun control started to take place in the 1960s (and reach its current form in the late 1990s) most firearms were relatively easy to acquire in the UK and guns were hardly a major political issue or a big concern among the general populace, it can even be argued that Britain was at one point a very pro-gun country considering that it is where the gun culture of the United States and Canada had originated from and that Protestants had their own equivalent of the American Second Amendment in the English Bill of Rights that almost certainly inspired the former. During WWII there was relatively popular support for the Home Guard, which was a government-regulated alliance of militia organisations that served as an auxiliary to the British Army, which had members who used their own personal firearms, and many British people at the time happily accepted donated (and even loaned) firearms from the United States.
</li><li> Similarly, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, all British-influenced anti-gun majority countries with strict gun laws (with the former to different extents, being even stricter than Britain itself) used to have a more American mentality towards firearms, though none of these countries were ever nations that had a "gun culture" to the same extent as North America. It is not 100% clear what lead to these cultural shifts in the commonwealth from the majority being moderate towards firearms to being anti-gun; the most simple explanation seems to be the lower level of people who grew up with firearms (such as on a farm) or having served in the military or high school cadets, and having a negative first impression of firearms due to high profile gun crimes such as mass shootings, terrorist attacks, or robberies. In essence, the population changed from a generation of independent people who had to survive the harshness of the wilderness to a generation of more sheltered and domesticated people who expected and could easily get comfort and government-provided security.
</li><li> The former British colony (later unrecognised republic) of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) that existed until 1980 was an interesting anomaly. Being a country filled with British expats with strong traditional British culture, yet it was not an uncommon sight to see people carrying guns as if they were in Texas. The last Prime Minister Ian Smith was a WWII veteran who fought as an RAF pilot and as a resistance fighter in occupied Italy, who unsuprisingly owned a revolver, and the country had conscription and widespread militarism. Many Rhodesians saw themselves as being "more British than Britain", when you look at the gun culture they had it sounds ridiculous to even compare them to modern day Britain, though it makes perfect sense when you consider than Rhodesia was run by older Brits whose perception of Britain was from a long-bygone era whose predominate public attitude towards many things, including guns, was more typical of socially-conservative Americans in the 21st century.
</li><li> It is also interesting to point out and somewhat surreal and bizarre that a small minority of Brits are in the present day extremely pro-gun, some could be perceived as possibly even more so than the average American. Good examples include Phillip Luty, a young activist who in the late 1990s was so angry at the government for putting in restrictions on pistols that he made his own submachine gun from basic household materials and wrote a book instructing others how to do so, later arrested and died in 2011 at the age of 46 due to inadequate cancer treatment while incarcerated. His book was used by terrorists and other criminals, which made it even easier for him to be sentenced. Another notable pro-gun Brit is Callum Long-Collins who runs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyV32zPb0gxz5x_fEkM2CCw">English Shooting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; although he believes in gun control, he also believes that people should be able to use their licensed firearms in self-defense without fear of being sent to prison. Apparently, his channel was filled with "extremist comments" which lead to his guns and license getting taken away by the police, who thought his beliefs made him unsuitable to own a firearm. He still runs his channel but because he wants his license back he doesn't make political statements anymore and most likely doesn't personally own any of the guns he fires in his videos.
</li><li> There is also a category of pro gun Brits who lean more moderately, such as Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage who wants the "handgun ban" to be lifted in the UK; many who are unfamiliar with the present UK gun laws see his plan as insane or radical, though it's actually not as radical of a reform as it seems, considering that handguns are not really banned in England, Scotland and Wales but are just required to have a long barrel and wire stock in order to fall outside the legal definition of a "pistol", making it more of a cosmetic than a functional restriction, and that he doesn't want guns to be necessarily easier to acquire. With this in mind he could be perceived as simply a Brit who doesn't mind firearms and has a moderate political perspective on them, rather than a true gun nut. Similarly, Boris Johnson was critical of the pistol laws and has been seen trying out some foreign military weapons during overseas visits; this has attracted criticism from the public, including from a father who lost his daughter during the school shooting in Dunblane, Scotland. Though Boris Johnson has also said that he supports gun control and doesn't want to significantly alter them, a stance which rather than staunchly pro gun, puts Boris in the "Brit who simply doesn't mind guns" category.
</li><li> Many pro-gun Brits have moved to the United States, one example of being Max Alexander, a far right wing ex Britsh Army and US Army veteran who runs a tactical training school called Max Velocity Tactical. Another is Rick Rescorla, who also served in the British and US Armies (along with the Northern Rhodesian and London Metropolitan Police). Before Rescorla perished on 9/11 while working as a security director at the World Trade Centre, he once proclaimed that if he knew that the police weren't going to handle the Columbine School Shootings more competently, that he would've drove over to the school and shot the perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Many people think of the Irish as being unruly, rebellious and swashbuckling people, though surprisingly to some, modern day Ireland has pretty strict gun laws with only bolt action rifles, shotguns and semi auto 22LR rifles (that can't look too 'tactical') being allowed and the public generally seeing American gun ownership as reckless or nutty. Ireland once did fit closer to the stereotype when not only was the general attitude toward guns different (not just in Ireland, but all over the world) but Irish people in general had to be more rugged in order to handle discrimination and the poor quality of life they had at the time, the modern day Republic of Ireland was founded after a period of civil war between a Continental Army esqe group called the Irish Volunteers and the British Empire that lasted from 1916 with the Easter rising to 1921 with Britain partitioning Ireland. Ireland experienced an internal civil war between the victorious rebels in power and the ones who disagreed with the direction the country went, and from the 1960s to the 1990s Ireland was since plagued by a series of terrorist attacks today know as the troubles, which lead to the Gardai Siochana (police) confiscating guns (particularly pistols, which are still highly restricted today), and the general public starting to dislike firearms due to them being used in widespread killings across the country. Ireland has also become more of a socialist country, which sees the state rather than the individual being responsible for protection, the old stereotype of an Irish person is more likely to be an Irish American these days than a Irish person from Ireland. People who identify as Irish through descent and act extra tough and like guns are often perceived as "Plastic Paddies" (someone who identifies as Irish but barely knows anything about Ireland or practices it's real culture), especially if they never set foot in Ireland, a good fictional example of someone that fits the above profile who would most likely be seen as a Plastic Paddy is Cait from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>.
</li><li> Like Britain, Japan is an extremely anti-gun country. Though civilian firearm ownership is not prohibited outright, the process for getting a gun and the selection of guns available to civilians makes Britain look like America in comparison. By law, only certain government agencies can own handguns and the only people who carry any firearm in public are the police, JSDF members on base, and bodyguards for state officials. Rifles can be obtained for hunting, but the red tape one has to go through in order to do so is a mile long, and most Japanese don't hunt anyway. The Yakuza are known for also possessing guns, but gun-related deaths in Japan are among the lowest in the world (even when accounting for police firing on criminals). However, this can be attributed less to the lack of guns (there's still knife attacks after all) and more to Japanese society putting extreme pressure on people to preserve social order.
<ul><li> Japan has a extremely low homicide rate but has experienced a relative large amount of massacres for such a peaceful country with low overall crime. These killers had to resort to improvised methods, such as fire, knives and motor vehicles due to guns being generally unavailable. Despite various martial arts weaponry such as katanas being legal and a strong admiration of the Samurai, there is yet to be any widespread violence in recent memory inspired by Japan's legendary warriors, with the exception of the early Showa-Era Japanese Empire during WWII, who committed horrific acts of "samurai-inspired" violence, the most infamous example being the Rape of Nanking during the Invasion of China in the late 1930s, where Imperial troops murdered Chinese civilians in "hunting contests" using katanas and bayonets. Although virtually none had any reservations about using firearms by any stretch, some Imperial Japanese soldiers admired the popular "samurai style" of combat so much that many preferred using bayonets rather than firing their rifles whenever they had the chance. Ironically, the ancient samurai, contrary to many people's preconception, had more of a pragmatic mindset than a moralistic or ideological one when it came to warfare, and saw firearms as useful much the same way as contemporary soldiers from other nations and generally didn't dislike them (namely that the goal in war is to outlive your opponents and/or prevent them from getting any satisfactory victory over you).
</li><li> A funny subversion to the usual anti gun sentiment in Japan is a man by the name of Yoshitomo Imura, who in 2014 was arrested for making a 3D printed revolver. He got caught because he posted videos of his activities on the internet. His content appears to indicate that he wants Japan (and presumably the rest of the world) to have the right to bear arms (if only because the lack of such usually renders most people helpless and/or even useless during times of trouble), and foolishly thought he could legally get away with creating a weapon that is both banned and unlicensed solely because he loaded it with blank cartridges (and for the record, loading a gun with blanks does <em>not</em> make it completely harmless).
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Most surprising of all is that the United States of America and Canada have become pretty anti gun countries compared to how they used to be; the biggest reasons North Americans dislike guns more are mass shootings (especially school shootings), gang wars, domestic violence and suicides involving firearms (which are issues more commonplace in the US than Canada). In 2018 students of the Majorie Stoneman Douglas High School shooting have formed the March for our Lives movement lead by survivors like Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg. Many American celebrities are vocally anti gun which completely subverts many foreigners' cowboy-esque preconception of North America. As of 2019 the National Rifle Association, the biggest gun lobbying group in America, is also now one of the most disliked groups among the general public for its perceived failure to curb massacres by firearms. The National Rifle Association, for its part, responded that a lobbyist group has zero controllable influence over criminals, who don't really care about the law in the first place.
<ul><li> Though gun laws are still lax compared to the rest of the world (rivalled only by some regions of Pakistan) and many Americans claim that they would literally rather risk their lives in a civil war than give up their right to bear arms, there is still an ongoing debate (or more accurately, screaming matches) between conservative gun owners in the "minutemen" movement and the liberal gun control activists on whether a well-armed population can defeat a government that owns tanks, combat aircraft, and attack drones. Liberal Americans laugh at the gun owners because they perceive them as complete idiots who think that they can shoot at anything and win, though gun owners usually feel like the gun control activists have insulted their intelligence and often respond that they are going to exercise what they perceive as their "second amendment rights" by threatening the politicians who pass the strict gun laws and the police officers and soldiers who go house to house to confiscate banned weapons, as opposed to fighting the government's war machines head on. Many gun owners point to successful revolutions where relatively simple armies or militia groups have defeated their government or invading armies, some are fairly common sense examples, such as the Vietnam War, where Americans lost a public relations battle to the Viet-Cong. The gun owners don't really have to take on the government, they just have to make an anti-gun government look like the bad guy. Imagine the sight of police literally burning down a house just to confiscate a single gun from the home-owner. Such an action performed by the authorities would not project an image of a benevolent, caring, and relatable government, but that of a totalitarian dictatorship.
</li><li> The three American cities known best for strict gun laws (New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles) are also known for the greatest amount of homicides by firearms. Unfortunately, said homicides are mostly due to gang activity, and the gangsters in question do not care at all about the gun bans, since the bans make their intended victims unable to effectively fight back (namely that the victims cannot purchase defensive weapons apart from electric stun guns or pepper spray, neither of which can even hope to incapacitate gunmen in realistic gunfight scenarios). It is therefore concluded by some gun-rights activists that gun bans in America have only contributed to a greater amount of <em>successful</em> firearm-caused murders as opposed to a reduction in gun-related deaths overall. The criminal weaponry being illegally smuggled in from neighboring states is one explanation given by gun-control advocates, but it does not account for why violent crime rates in the "donor" states are not equally as high.
</li></ul></li><li> 3d-printed firearms are banned in most of the world, but for reasons that any firearms expert would deem laughable. American politicians who were in favor of getting rid of "ghost guns" (as 3d-printed firearms have been detrimentally labeled) claimed that 3d-printed guns could potentially pass through a metal detector, get on a plane, and then be used for terrorism. Any gun-nut worth his salt would retort that nobody has invented invisible ammunition!
</li><li> Russia, since the Soviet Union came into power, has generally had extremely strict gun control, though the country has heavily loosened its gun policies since the Soviet Union transitioned into the Russian Federation in 1991, the general public hasn't became quite as pro gun as the policies within the country, although you can own AK pattern long guns in Russia and attitudes towards gun ownership is somewhat more positive, recent polls indicate that 70% of Russians are opposed to the right to bear arms.
