On the surface, this villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">works within the system</a> and commands a great deal of respect from the average citizen, but behind the scenes, conducts all manners of nastiness. Even the heroes (or the audience!) may be fooled until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, unaware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> is someone so publicly trusted.
</p><p>Should the heroes know the truth, they're still stymied by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">no one else does</a>. Attempts to bust the villain will be met with harassment lawsuits, breaking &amp; entering or assault charges, or bad press. The heroes may even be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander">falsely painted as villains</a> in the public eye. (Some heroes embrace this image and become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>.) Should the heroes turn up actual evidence that something is up, it'll probably be ripped up by the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">crack legal team</a> (which Villains With Good Publicity <em>always</em> have), or spun to look like honest behavior.

Then again, heroics are 90% based on breaking and entering, stalking, trespassing, assault, battery, and espionage anyway, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">so they may have a point there.</a>

</p><p>In an episodic series, a Villain With Good Publicity is a good way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">preserve the status quo</a>; the best the hero can hope to do is foil a particular plot, not bust the actual villain.

There's also a good chance that the villain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice">using copious amounts of bribery</a> to keep their image clean. If things get even worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings">the people whom the hero tries to protect will actively assist</a> the villain against the heroes.

Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a>.
</p><p>This villain may be portrayed as a hero (or the hero), and may even think of themself as the hero. Their villainous acts might even be portrayed as heroic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a> may lead to viewing a story's hero as a Villain With Good Publicity.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a> might have some luck setting up an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryCharityDonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryCharityDonation">Involuntary Charity Donation</a> to deprive the villain of assets while being unable to retaliate without compromising their good publicity.
</p><p>Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain">Falsely Reformed Villain</a>, where a villain puts on short-term pretense of reform.

The exact opposite is a villain who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>, and a more extreme version is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">Devil in Plain Sight</a> (whom no one cares about one way or the other).

</p><p>In some settings, the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">may actually have a plausible case</a> for being considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">(sorta) good guy</a>.

The effects of this are felt in the first part of the nationals, when a reporter tells another that Nodoka is the only Kiyosumi player worth noting, meaning that people seem to have bought into Teru's lie that she didn't have a sister. While Teru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">indeed disowned Saki</a>, it never really made it to the news in the main series. Saki only hears about being disowned when Mihoko mentions asking Nishida about Teru and Saki's relationship during Mihoko's own interview.
</li><li> This trope is practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">the hat</a> of the Machine Empire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em>. Virtually every world in two galaxies sees them as the wave of the future. Even the protagonist, who watched his own mother being brutally gunned down by Machine-Humans, simply concludes that if he'd been a Machine-Human himself, he would have been powerful enough to stop them.
</li><li> Muruta Azrael from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> is all-but-worshipped by the EA generals, and has the Earth's rulers in his pocket. His successor, Lord Djibril, is regarded as a pale shadow of him, primarily because he has none of his clout (well, that and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain">ridiculous choice of clothing</a>).

Though it starts to unravel when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lacus Clyne appears on a worldwide broadcast publicly denouncing him, and at the same time exposing that he'd been using a body double to impersonate her</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Claw from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em> has a positively ridiculous amount of this, and most viewers will probably have to keep reminding themselves that this guy has killed two women in cold blood and his group is behind every evil thing seen throughout the series.

</li><li> This is a theme in the Punk Hazard arc as two separate villains get this treatment. The primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc, Caesar Clown, has devoted followers that call him Master, but whom he sees as mere experiment fodder. The second is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marine Vice-Admiral Vergo</span>, who puts up the front of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> but is revealed to be in league with the mysterious "Joker." Oddly enough, the character in this arc with the worst reputation actually chooses to ally with the Straw Hats.
</li><li> The first to do this was Captain Kuro, who first appears as Kaya's loyal, if stuffy, butler Klahadore. As he tells his subordinate Django, the three years he spent Kaya's employ was to build up a good reputation, so that when Kaya dies in the Black Cat Pirates' raid, no one in the village will think twice about Kaya leaving him her fortune- provided Django hypnotizes her into making said will before dying, anyway.
</li><li> More recently, Donquixote Doflamingo has been this to Dressrosa. To the public, he is a benevolent rightful king who rescued the country from the previous ruler who apparently went insane one day and started indiscriminately killing civilians, and ushered in a new age of peace, wealth and prosperity. Behind the scenes though, he is a bloodthirsty pirate and underworld crime lord who usurped the throne by using his string powers to puppet the king and his army into committing atrocities. He used his subordinate, Sugar's ability to turn any troublemakers, criminals, and opponents into subservient toys and mindwipe any memories of them from the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His approval rating literally falls to 0 once Usopp defeats Sugar and everyone connects the missing pieces, and found out Doflamingo was the one who destroyed the nation in the first place</span>.

They quickly gained public support for hunting down rogue heroes that wouldn't register with the government. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> and throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a></em> period, he got promoted to the head of <em>all</em> government superheroes.

He eventually lost his position when he had a major breakdown caught on camera, showing that he hadn't been able to put the Goblin <em>that</em> far behind him. <em>Dark Reign</em> also shows the disadvantages of this trope. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">The Incredible Hercules</a> all used Osborn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">need to maintain good publicity against him</a>, putting him in compromising positions to the extent that Tony arranged for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Osborn to beat him up on live television while Tony was suffering brain damage in a virtually obsolete Iron Man armor</span>. You just know Osborn wishes he could simply pumpkin bomb them like in the good old days.
<ul><li> Even before the Civil War, Osborn managed to pull this off when he publicly returned to life after faking his death following the discovery that his powers as the Goblin included an increased healing factor. Presenting fake evidence that he had never been the Goblin, Osborn was able to take control of the <em>Daily Bugle</em>, gather various mystical artefacts, and even frame Spider-Man for the murder of a small-time crook while also provoking Spider-Man into attacking him on camera (Peter had to resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">providing fake evidence that a pair of criminals had attacked Osborn while disguised as Spider-Man</a> to clear the second charge, even if he was able to prove who really killed the criminal).

The fact of the matter is that they're ruthless criminals, but their publicity is <em>so</em> good, that <em>J. Jonah Jameson likes them</em>, and he normally hates superheroes. The fact that the Spacemen are allegedly astronauts like JJJ's son, who he considers a real hero, is probably a factor.

The comics go on to show how difficult it is to get this trope down. All of his actions are being reported on by the media, and even slight outbursts of anger can end with him getting in trouble, numerous citizens either in his old faction, the Autobots, and even the Neutrals don't trust him, and he's always under scrutiny.

When his brother King Robert dies he plots to seize power even before Robert is cold and then marries into the powerful Tyrell family to usurp the crown, before he hears the truth of Joffrey's illegitimacy. This sets him up as a foil to the middle Baratheon brother Stannis, who claims the throne out of a sense of duty, as under Westerosi law Robert having no legitimate children makes Stannis his heir, however his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">strong principles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">lack of social skills</a> make him disliked by most of the nobility.

Renly plans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">to kill Stannis</a> the next day in battle, citing his larger army as justifying him having a better claim then Stannis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Melisandre, a witch who believes Stannis her Messiah, assassinates Renly with blood magic, yet after his death, Renly goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade">Historical Hero Upgrade</a>, as it is believed his ghost helped defeat Stannis' army and save King's Landing at the Battle of the Blackwater, the new Tyrell-backed regime overlooking the fact he was clearly a traitor.</span> Meanwhile, Brienne of Tarth, who was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">love with Renly</a>, continues to look on him in a favorable light.
</li><li> The Tyrell family is this as a whole, although their villainy is more ruthlessness than malice. They conspire to marry Margery to <em>four</em> different Baratheon kings to join their family into royalty. The first, King Robert himself, is the only one where they never got their opportunity as they (along with Renly) were planning to try to get Robert smitten with Margaery before revealing the truth of the incest. When Robert dies before this plot is enacted and Renly declares himself king, they join his cause even knowing he is not the legitimate heir. While fighting for Renly's cause, they seize all food heading up towards King's Landing from the Reach, causing mass starvation and violence. When they decide to throw in with the Lannisters, they then give away food to the poor, who don't realize that the Tyrells are the reason why there was a shortage in the first place. After obtaining Sansa's (a shell-shocked 11-year old) trust, they verify Joffrey's true nature and kill him almost immediately after the ceremony is legalized while also setting up Sansa and Tyrion as patsies.

Frank Underwood, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">American counterpart</a>, is just as much of a political schemer, and just as willing to resort to murder to get what he wants.

Eventually, his new mistress Vanessa Marianna persuades him to make a public appearance as a philanthropist in order to get some good publicity in response to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Devil of Hell's Kitchen</a> becoming a pain in his side.
<ul><li> In season 3, Fisk finds himself having to build himself back up to this, as the press are rightfully villainizing him as a criminal, and protesters are demonstrating outside the hotel he's bought and also bribed the FBI into putting him up in. Fisk's method of regaining the good graces of the press is to hire one such agent, Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter, stick him in a Daredevil suit, and has him attack the <em>New York Bulletin</em> to both discredit Karen Page, and more importantly get rid of Jasper Evans so that Jasper can't go on record about how Fisk paid him to shank him as part of his gambit to manipulate the FBI. When Karen provokes Fisk by revealing that she killed James Wesley, Fisk orders a hit on her using Dex, and though Matt and Karen drive him off, Father Lantom and two bystanders are killed during the attack. Subsequently, Fisk uses Dex's bloodshed to call a press conference at the hotel, wherein he finally sways the public back to his side. In an effort to break through this, Nelson &amp; Murdock get Ray Nadeem to testify before a grand jury, with Karen also calling a press conference of her own outside the courthouse while Nadeem is testifying. Fisk gets advanced warning of their plans from Felix Manning and has his men intimidate the grand jury into declining to indict Fisk (after a failed attempt to ambush Nadeem and Matt en route to the courthouse). Between this, Vanessa ordering Nadeem be killed by Dex that very evening (and posthumously framed for the death of another FBI agent that his boss killed), Fisk is back on top and a lot of the city's upper crust elite turn out for his and Vanessa's wedding. That is, until Karen and Foggy get the <em>Bulletin</em> to run a video confession Nadeem made before his death, combined with Matt turning Dex against Fisk.

Except Mariah is very effectively ambushed by a TV reporter during a live interview asking about her ties to her cousin's crime ring (due to Luke's attack on her office at Crispus Attucks), and all Mariah can really do is end the interview immediately and have the reporter and her camera crew removed from the house. From there on, the entire second half of the season sees Mariah trying to regain the good publicity she's lost. Even after managing to get Luke ousted as Carl Lucas, it's pretty clear it will be a long uphill battle. At the start of season 2, Mariah is still struggling to regain standing, and at her publicist's suggestion, reestablishes a relationship with her estranged daughter Tilda Johnson, and is planning to go legit by selling off her gun dealing ventures in favor of shady stock dealing, and open up several housing complexes. Unfortunately, she's never able to achieve that, as Bushmaster turns up to settle an old score with Mariah over her grandparents' murder of his parents 30 years ago. His opening shots of war are to put the severed heads of three of her associates on pikes in the entryway to her new housing project where they are prominently displayed when Mariah holds a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Then he kidnaps and kills her stockbroker, bankrupts her, and burns down her brownstone. Mariah's way of retaliating is to go to a restaurant owned by Bushmaster's aunt and uncle and kill everyone inside, saving Bushmaster's uncle Anansi for last by setting him on fire, letting him burn in agony for a solid 15 seconds, before shooting him in the head. Shades and Tilda are disgusted with Mariah and sever all ties with her. Shades makes a deal with the police to help them bring down Mariah by implicating her in the death of Bushmaster's uncle and Cottonmouth, while Tilda helps Bushmaster make one last attempt to kill Mariah during a free event she throws at Harlem's Paradise. This attempt fails, Mariah is arrested, and she's arraigned and locked up in jail to await trial. While locked up, she attempts to order a purge of people who could implicate her in her criminal activities, including her assistant Alex. Which just gets Tilda to discreetly poison Mariah while visiting her at the jail.

You don't even want to know what he does to people he's <em>not</em> attached to...And let's not even think about what he does to people that he actually <em>dislikes</em>.

Everyone acknowledges his heroic past, but the only parts of the country that actually support him are Gwaren (which is his fief), Amaranthine, belonging to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter">Psycho Supporter</a> Rendon Howe, and Denerim, where his government is based. Highever is pissed at him for supporting a Howe coup against the ruling Cousland family, Redcliffe is led by the slain king's uncle, and most of the Bannorn <em>hates</em> his guts. It's actually rather easy to oust him, because his actions have pretty much eroded all of the nobility's good will by the time you're strong enough to challenge him, and only one nobleman supports him without question (because he's afraid Loghain will pillage his lands in retaliation).

By the third generation, they have human followers from around the world, and it's hard to go anywhere without hearing something about them.

<ul><li> This is the case for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> Azura.

In fact, the destruction of the Dunmer homeland has made Azura <em>more</em> revered in the Dunmeri religion and was what ultimately ended worship of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Tribunal</a>, her most hated enemies.
</li><li> Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots whose sphere covers a litany of high crimes including murder, assassination, betrayal, and treason is near-universally considered one of the more outright malevolent Daedric Princes. However, similar to Azura, to the Dunmer, he is considered one of the "good" Daedra and the anticipation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Almalexia</a>. Specifically, they see Boethiah as a brutal but positive force, driving them to be tougher and stronger, and to be guarded against treachery and betrayal. In effect, Boethiah's harsh trials and ruthless betrayals push the Dunmer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">become greater than they think they are</a>.

<ul><li> Possibly your character, in the first game; as the game's base assumption is that your character is evil, rather than choosing between being good or evil, your moral choice is whether to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> maniac who slaughters all in your path...or a Villain With Good Publicity who uses the respect and gratitude of the people to further your own evil ends.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordDarkLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordDarkLegend">Overlord: Dark Legend</a></em>, the above Overlord's predecessor, Lord Gromgard, has amazing publicity. His incompetent relatives have driven the kingdom to ruin, and the people are just so glad to finally have someone who knows what they're doing and can finally restore prosperity that they treat the whole "evil overlord" thing as little more than an amusing quirk.
</li><li> You can also be a Villain With Good Publicity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII">Overlord II</a></em>, but this time, it comes by mind controlling the populace into loving you, rather than genuinely earning their respect — you cruelly use them as tools, pawns, cannon fodder, and meat shields, but they have no choice but to be worshipful servants.
<ul><li> A better example is Emperor Solaris- while the Overlord's "good" or "lawful evil" option is brainwashing his subjects, most of them were unwilling serfs under the "Glorious Empire" before you conquer them instead, the rest are the spoiled elite nobles, that love their emperor, along with almost everyone that isn't a slave, or similarly oppressed. The Real kicker is that the Emperor rose to power on the back of anti-magic sentiment after a cataclysm and plague caused by magic, earning the love of many, and the eternal devotion of the upperclass and nobles he uses to maintain his power. Beyond being the main but distant antagonist of the entire game, he also is secretly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flroian Greenheart</span> a trusted follower of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Fay</span> and seemingly the closest thing the story has to a real hero when he isn't being the comic relief. More than that it turns out he was the cause of the cataclysm and plague in the first place because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was an elf with no magic and sought out the Overlord's tower heart after the last one disappeared, accidentally causing it to go critical and explode like a nuclear reactor</span>. He then used the crisis to gain political power and champion an anti-magic agenda while secretly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gathering all the "purged" re-stolen, magic for himself with his end game being ascending to godhood, with his failed attempt creating the final boss of the game</span>.

</li><li> Wilson "Kingpin" Fisk in the 1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>. He's a well-respected member of the community. Peter Parker doesn't even know he's a criminal mastermind until late in the season, and, at one point, saves him from an attack by the Hobgoblin during a ground-breaking ceremony.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> is also a Villain With Good Publicity in all versions: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> don't know about his criminal activity as a businessman <em>or</em> as the Green Goblin. In this particular series, the other crime lords are the same: even <em>Spidey</em> thought Silvermane was a nice old man.

He manages to convince the entire city that the sharks and their father are the real bad guys, essentially ensuring that they blame everything wrong on <em>them</em>. On the other hand, that's the only plan of his that actually works. The Sharks finally manage to put a dent on his credibility by forcing him to assume his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifter">Pirahnoid form</a> on national TV.
</li><li> Shere Khan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>, although feared because of his immense power and wealth, citizens of Cape Suzette do not suspect that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> to the point of having dealings with criminals like pirates and gangsters.

<ul><li> Oroku Saki himself during season 3 of the Turtles revamp. By singlehandedly funding the rebuilding of New York City after an alien invasion, he was hailed as a hero and humanitarian. While it hadn't directly affected the Turtles' efforts against him much (being ninjas <em>and</em> mutant freaks, they have to work in secrecy anyway), it was still irritating. The public was never the wiser, even constructing a library in his honor when he was finally defeated.

Powell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Not only did he exploit Sari's lack of a birth certificate to make himself the legitimate CEO of Sumdac Systems (then again, she's only eight), but he also made expert use of legal loopholes to justify his hiring of mad scientist Henry "Headmaster" Masterson. He's shady and corrupt, even getting out of even more legal trouble with his matter-eating virus. He's kicked out of the company when Isaac returns but continues to do business by selling Soundwave toys. After they're revealed as the real Soundwave's minions, the backlash finally puts him out of business. His return in the almanac mentions him having a few more resources at his disposal, which he used to get an AllSpark fragment... which backfired by turning his car into a Decepticon named Tux, who drained the rest of his resources.

To the outside world, he was a beloved inventor, super scientist, and media darling whose name still carries weight in the present time. Behind the scenes, however, he was a hideously awful parent and a philandering man-whore who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blackmailed his best friend into being his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandAttackDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandAttackDog">Right-Hand Attack Dog</a> for years</span>.

The most of what we get to see of the good publicity part was in "Water, Water, Everywhere". The heroes took photographs linking him to a scheme of illegal waste dumping that was contaminating the community's water supply and he managed to explain it away by claiming he was there to investigate and help. Fortunately, in order to give credence to these claims, he had to finance a project to de-pollute the water supply.

<ul><li> The Brotherhood in the episode "No Good Deed". The only ones to realize they're up to no good are the X-Men (who they frame for violently using their powers) and Edward Kelly (who doesn't know they're up to no good, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">assumes they are because they're mutants</a>).
</li><li> Edward Kelly himself is one to some extent. To many, he's a noble principal who wants to help his students, and to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a>, he is legitimately a good principal. He's just such a massive racist against mutants that he tries to encourage fellow mutant hater Duncan to team up <em>with the Brotherhood</em> just so they can <em>pick a fight with Cyclops and get him, and him only, expelled simply for being a good mutant</em>.

<ul><li> The Reach invoke this by going to the capitol and peacefully meeting with diplomats. It doesn't exactly help that G. Gordon Godfrey has been spending the rest of the season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">complaining about how the Justice League doesn't do this</a> or, worse, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">that he's right to do so</a>.
</li><li> In Season 3, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> is once again this. Being the head of the New United Nations that include superheroes from around the world as members and getting laws passed that keeps the Justice League from doing their jobs as heroes with sanctions from many countries. He has successfully convinced many countries, and even some heroes of that country, the Justice League does more harm than good. The heavy restrictions cause Batman and others to leave, believing the league is now useless.
</li><li> G. Gordon Godfrey himself counts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since he's actually the New God Glorious Godfrey of Apokolips, Darkseid's specialist in manipulating populations via mass media</span>. His show is quite popular, and even Superboy finds him fascinating.

<h1 id="overlay-title">Hans Reveals His True Colors</h1>
<p class="_pmvv-vidbox-descTxt" id="overlay-descrip">
For most of the movie, Hans seems to be a classic prince charming, but the climax reveals the opposite, and it's just as shocking to the audience as it is to Anna. Hans actually exploited her naivetÃ© so that he can steal the Arendellian throne. With Anna dying from the icy heart curse, Hans puts on his metaphorical cover so he can advance his agenda of becoming King of Arendelle.	</p>
