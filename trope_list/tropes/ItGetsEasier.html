</p><p>This trope is often used to segue a character from your average guy to a cold blooded killer; the more he's had to kill, the less he cares each time he's done it. It's also usually part of the backstory for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">Hitman with a Heart</a>. Occasionally it also is invoked in crime dramas in storylines where use of deadly force by police officers becomes part of the story (most notably the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> films), wherein idealistic characters (often newbie cadets who have had to end a life for the first time) express fear of this trope. A first kill scenario often occurs in films and TV series involving newbie officers/agents, with "it gets easier" often implied if the character proceeds to amass a body count as the film/series goes on without any apparent ill effects.

By the time of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and following his transformation into a homunculus</span> you have a man who kills without a shred of remorse.

However, by the time we get halfway through the series, when their country has been at war on multiple fronts for several episodes, they are "on patrol" and "in battle." The newest Sibyllae are fine with that, since they only joined after the war had begun, but for the original members, it is something of a shock once it is pointed out how much things have changed since the beginning.

When Mikasa is asked whether she or Eren felt that way after the first time they killed, the audience is not shown her response to this question.

See, magic works via your beliefs and emotions. In order to cast a spell, you have to absolutely believe that you're doing the right thing with it (it's a plot point in <em>Turn Coat</em> that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">Plot-Triggering Death</a> victim was not killed by magic despite the suspect being capable of it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because the culprit was mind-controlled and so could not believe in the cause</span>).

Disturbingly, the kills are of the cold-blooded variety: assassinations and murders, rather than kills in the heat of battle. Sarah and Casey's high body count (and both being willing to kill in cold blood when necessary) attest to the clear implication that it gets easier.

He also went pretty crazy, though whether it was the killing, the utter weirdness, the many, many aliens who decided to stick things in his brain and swirl it around a bit, or some combination thereof is anyone's guess.
<ul><li> Crichton almost certainly had military training, given that he was former space shuttle pilot and they're nearly always drawn from Air Force or Navy pilot ranks. But in the modern era, air-to-air combat is rare and thus few fighter pilots have actually killed anybody. Thus, this trope still holds true over the course of the series.
</li><li> Crichton went out of his way to avoid killing anyone for most of the first season; his first kill is in episode 18 and was caused by mind control, which caused him considerable distress. After that it was like a switch was flipped in his head, and he dispassionately finished off the surviving enemies at the end of the episode by himself.

After soul searching and discussions with his commanding officer and a priest, the character not only agrees that it gets easier, but he acknowledges that he actually <em>likes</em> killing, which is described as being pretty much a requirement for the job. The message is delivered with a bit of irony given the mission that sparks the soul-searching - to protect someone from being assassinated by using a sniper rifle capable of killing someone in a crowd with little risk of collateral damage to innocents - doesn't actually fall into the category of cold-blooded murder.

<ul><li> Snake's brother Liquid gives a more vitriolic version to Snake in the same game, accusing him of enjoying it. Inverted in <em>Guns of the Patriots:</em> if the player kills an exorbitant amount of enemy soldiers during any one chapter, Snake will have a flashback to the scene with Liquid, and he throws up. For Old Snake, killing gets harder, sort of; more precisely, he gets sick when he realises how easy it's gotten.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the major plot points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em> is the PMC's trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoke</a> this trope by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using the Sons of the Patriots system to regulate soldiers' emotions.</span> Everything is manipulated so that war literally feels like a video game to them. But when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> SOP is hijacked,</span> reality comes crashing down, and battle fatigue sets in. What's worse, SOP didn't actually get rid of the emotions: it bottled them up so that when the system was interfered with, they all came rushing to the surface at once. Watching the formerly calm soldiers writhe on the ground, bawling hysterically, or laughing uncontrollably as they beat each other to death with their bare hands, is a very disturbing scene to watch, potentially even <em>more so</em> when you know <em>why</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em> when Jack says, "It's never as sweet as the first time", referring to drinking blood. This is probably a dual reference to drug addiction and the fact that vampires are natural killers. It's also played straight, and used as a gameplay mechanic: killing innocent people causes the player character to lose Humanity points, which makes them more likely to Frenzy and gives them increasingly nasty dialogue options. Jack urges the player to avoid killing innocents whenever possible to avoid sinking too far into their monstrous nature.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VacantSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VacantSky">Vacant Sky</a></em>, the main character Auria struggles to cope with the knowledge that she's just killed a human being after panicking and killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the husband of their hostess</span>. Though she shows remorse afterward, the subsequent journal entry combined with the fact that the event song is called "A Farewell to Innocence" implies that it only goes downhill from here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em>: The titular character starts the game as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker">Apologetic Attacker</a> and cries things like "I'm sorry!" and "No..." the first few times she kills someone. If you decide to become an instrument of alien genocide, her quotes change to things like "Hah... YOU DIE!" and "AAAARGH!"
</li><li> In the 2nd chapter of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpiritEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpiritEngine">The Spirit Engine</a></em>, one of your team members stops just short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when you have to kill a team of thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> bounty hunters. In the 3rd chapter, s/he's not too happy about having to kill an assassin. In the last one, they're casually slaughtering dozens of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchclockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchclockVillain">soldiers</a> without so much as a sigh. It's similar in the sequel, although not as pronounced.
</li><li> This is the trope Jason Brody's development is based around in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>. He starts out as a privileged upper class post grad looking to enjoy the jungle paradise with his friends while trying to ignore his slowly-building feelings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife">Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life</a>, and ends up getting kidnapped and nearly sold into slavery. In the process of escaping he watches his brother die in his arms, and moments later makes his first kill in self-defense, which nearly causes him to break down were it not for the disastrous circumstances of his escape. He also shows reluctance to even buy a gun knowing he's going to be using it on people, even protesting that he's never actually <em>fired on</em> somebody. As the game goes on though, and he ranks up a body count most military platoons would be jealous of, this trope ends up causing him to devolve into a all-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the good ending, he fully recognizes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">he has become a monster</a> due to his kill count, while desperately hoping that there is a way for him to come back from the abyss he's fallen into.</span>

During the game, he puts the skills his father taught him to good use, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> terrorists kidnapping his girlfriend</span> have given him a good reason to kill. Early into the game, he comments that a giant spider-mech is something he can "shoot without feeling guilty," although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">the driver pops out of the hatch soon after and becomes Jason's next kill.</a> Shortly after <em>that,</em> Jason comments, "Killing's getting easier, not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's a good thing</span>."

As the game goes on, he looses his reluctance and later becomes <em>bloodthirsty</em>.
<ul><li> It applies to his support team as well.

Lara's first human kill leaves her a traumatized, bloody and sobbing mess. Afterwards Roth tells her it can't have been easy to have killed someone, but she responds that what terrifies her even more is how easy it actually was (granted, it was a life-or-death situation with a heavy subtext of attempted sexual assault or even rape, so...) In-story it eventually does get easier, so that by the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> of Roth's death</span>, Lara has come to accept death as part of the reality she's found herself in, and has made a conscious decision to fight back against the Solarii.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> has a game mechanic for this: witnessing violent deaths causes a dwarf to grow jaded.

The trope is then played with: it <em>doesn't</em> get easier for her to kill other people... because it was never hard in the first place.

</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There's a psychological condition in real life that <em>is</em> this trope; it's called "Rapid Habituation."
</li><li> Military experience causes this for many. Though it has been noted that some have no initial difficulty whatsoever while not exhibiting any behaviors indicative of mental illness.
</li><li> Snipers in the military have a saying "the hardest shot you will ever make is your first".
</li><li> US Police departments seem to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItNeverGetsAnyEasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItNeverGetsAnyEasier">think the opposite</a>, or at least encourage it. Lethal force is without question an absolute last resort and should an officer be forced into that option they are taken off duty for a brief period and receive counseling afterwards (almost) without exception. Most police forces agree that an officer should be able to quickly and efficiently deal with a violent criminal who refuses to be taken in, but that doesn't mean it should be something that's easily brushed off.
<ul><li> Furthermore, in most jurisdictions officers also undergo investigation procedures to determine if a kill was righteous or justified, and face career termination or even imprisonment should it be found the killing was not justified. Although fictional, the treatment of a police sniper in the first episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a> reflects what officers often experience, even if they discharge their weapon without injury to anyone. Many police officers have over the years been tried for murder or manslaughter, which could be seen as further discouragement of using deadly force unless necessary. (By comparison, in real life a character such as CSI: Miami's Horatio Caine or Dirty Harry would likely be removed from active duty due to their penchant for lethal force.)
</li><li> Also, films and TV shows often give the impression that most veteran cops have killed at least once. In reality, if one takes the total number of police officers in the US or Canada one would find only a small percentage have ever had to use lethal force, and an even smaller number have had to do so more than once (unlike, say, Horatio).
<ul><li> Although it is becoming increasingly common for TV and film to lampshade this, mentioning that 95-97% of cops never fire their weapon outside of the shooting range, and that the specific officers we see are the exception. Given that most of these shows deal with one police unit out of cities with tens of thousands of cops, it only starts becoming unbelievable if you're under the impression that all of these shows exist in the same continuity.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Despite the growing quality of simulated-dissection software, medical and nursing students are still expected to engage in human or animal dissections as part of their professional education. This isn't just for hands-on skill development; growing accustomed to grisly experiences and the reality of death is as much a part of these exercises as is building anatomical knowledge. Not a killing variant, but same concept: repeated exposure to death makes dealing with it easier in the future.
<ul><li> The same deal goes for the equivalent animal-oriented professions. Fifty percent of qualified veterinary technicians in the United States wash out of the profession within five years of qualification due to this trope. Technician students are told up front at the start of their training that you either learn to cope, or you quit. There aren't exceptions.
</li></ul></li><li> Serious training scenarios for emergency responders (military or civilian) will sometimes use professional makeup artists so the "victims" will have very realistic looking injuries. It's one thing to practice moving someone and pretend they have a broken leg; it's quite another when you see a realistic-looking bone sticking out of what looks like ripped-open flesh from a compound fracture and the victim making an ear-piercing scream if you accidentally touch the wound, combined with litres of realistic blood all over the place.
</li><li> Ernie Pyle describes this in his wartime column, <em>Brave Men, Brave Men</em>:
<div class="indent">The most vivid change is the casual and workshop manner in which they now talk about killing. They have made the psychological transition from the normal belief that taking human life is sinful, over to a new professional outlook where killing is a craft. To them now there is nothing morally wrong about killing. In fact it is an admirable thing.
</div></li><li> In a more calm sense, life in general. It seems like a lot of tragedies hit people in their teen years, like breakups, disappointments (not getting into your preferred college for example) and they tend to always be a crisis. In general, later in life, people mellow and develop a sense of "I've been through this once, I can do it again."
</li><li> Although the TV series Chuck features operatives of the CIA, which exists in real life, the "red test" requirement for becoming a full agent as featured in that series (committing a cold-blooded murder under orders) is unlikely to exist for real CIA agents (at least, as far as the public knows, although Lindsay Moran, in her memoir <em>Blowing My Cover: My Life as a CIA Spy</em>, states that she was never required to kill as an agent). The same goes for the real-life Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> the TV series evolved from an earlier organization that used a red test-like scenario.)
</li><li> This trope, as well as variations of it, is often cited by critics for why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">video games are harmful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators">Murder Simulators</a> that cause violence behavior. Given how often modern games explore the moral issues of taking lives, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">human as well as non-human</a>, it really shouldn't come as a surprise that, so far, no science exists that backs the notion that video games cause any more or less violence than books, and video gamers are no more or less violent or sociopathic than anyone else; it just becomes more of an uproar in media when avid gamers kill people than when passionate quarterbacks do the same.
</li><li> Experiencing death in the family or losing a friend to death is extremely saddening and heartbreaking for everyone that were close with the person that passed on. If the same people lose yet another family member/friend, they may not be as upset as they were with the first death; more so if they can visibly tell that the person in question is going to die.
</li><li> Just as fictional depictions about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> have this plot line in them, real-life mobsters are typically required to do a contract murder in order to "get their button", i.e. be inducted into the secret criminal society. This is done to show that they have no qualms doing the job when asked by the higher-ups, are aware of the risks and dangers involved if they get out of line, and most importantly, it confirms they are NOT an undercover cop (especially after the Donnie Brasco scandal, in which an undercover FBI agent infiltrated one mob crew and almost became a "made man").
</li><li> If someone lasts longer than their first bad call, anyone who works as an emergency medical responder will eventually experience this, as they must in order to function. The same is true of emergency room personnel they deal with. This can sometimes cause a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>: family and friends of a deceased person can get outraged when, as they are grieving, they happen to see personnel joking and laughing or talking casually soon thereafter. For the family, the death of a loved one is a horrible event. For the personnel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">it's not the first and won't be the last</a>.
</li><li> A variation of this trope that has nothing to do with death: actors, actresses and fashion models who undertake their first nude and or sexual scenes on camera or pose nude for the first time often report that after a very difficult first time, subsequent occasions become less stressful. A recent example of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>, who is on record as having become emotional over posing nude for several magazines back in 2011, most notably <em>W</em> and <em>Playboy</em> (her nervousness was chronicled in the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpWithTheKardashians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpWithTheKardashians">Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a></em> that covered the <em>Playboy</em> shoot).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rvv5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rvv5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rvv5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Those who remember that she was having sex on camera years before this might think that this was all put on for the sake of the TV show.</span> Fast-forward to 2015 and she's doing nude spreads (albeit tasteful ones) left, right and centre without batting an eye.
