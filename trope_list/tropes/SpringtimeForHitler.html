I'm Sakamoto</a></em> is Acchan and other bullies trying to make Sakamoto slip up or look stupid. They do this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy">out of jealousy for how easily Sakamoto attracts the attention of all the ladies</a>. Whenever the bullies try, Sakamoto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">Inexplicably Awesome</a>, and always just ends up looking even more cool than he did before.
<ul><li> The bullies remove Sakamoto's desk from class so he has nowhere to sit. Sakamoto opens the window and sits on the windowsill instead, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWind">Hot Wind</a>.
</li><li> When the bullies corner Sakamoto with a DVD he needs, they say he'll only get it if he rents a porn movie for them. But Sakamoto effortlessly manages to slip in to the 18+ section undetected, and has such a good poker face that he bluffs the store owner into letting him rent it.
</li><li> The bullies hold Sakamoto's balloon sculpture hostage at the culture festival, threatening to pop it if he comes closer. Sakamoto makes a gun out of balloons, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyAwesome">somehow</a> uses the gun to pop the balloons himself, even making another sculpture out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Tytania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Tytania">Tytania</a></em>, a weak planet sends a starfleet against the almighty Tytania empire just to not surrender without a fight and do it on more or less profitable terms. They assign the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">worst officer</a> they have as the admiral, but he somehow manages to win the battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. Well, it doesn't turn out to be fun, eventually.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> has a humorous example of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Noby</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">Nobita</a> uses one of Doraemon's gadgets and meets a goat-like alien.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em> usually manages to complete missions that were planned to fail by their admiral. Which sometimes causes disasters for authority.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PowerStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PowerStone">Power Stone</a></em>, a number of characters have been sent to work as slave labour in the mines to pay off their gambling debts. Falcon and Gunrock come up with a plan to rescue them by losing everything and being sent as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">Cut</a> to them holding massive piles of cash.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DiamondIsUnbreakable">Diamond Is Unbreakable</a></em>, Koichi catches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">romantic attention of the beautiful but terrifying Yukako</a> and wants to get out of it. Josuke and Okuyasu help him out by spreading rumors that Koichi is a real scumbag, in the hopes that it'll put off Yukako; instead, she abducts him and locks him in a house so she can "fix" him and turn him into a proper young man.
</li><li> The Sugar Mountain arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteelBallRun">Steel Ball Run</a></em> is like this, with deadlier consequences than usual. Due to the effects of an enemy Stand, Gyro and Johnny must rid themselves of <em>everything</em> they obtained in a recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe">Honest Axe</a> trade. The problem is that their attempts to rid themselves of everything often wind up with them getting <em>more</em>.
</li><li> And that wasn't even the worst of it. After finally disposing of all their wealth, they then have to trade away a pair of mummified ears... the one item they were after in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> episode, Tsumugi decides she wants to get hit on the head, but Ritsu doesn't want to do it without a reason, resulting in various attempts that fail miserably.
</li><li> A grimly hilarious example occurs in the 4th Ninja World War arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, when Kabuto resurrects a number of famous and extremely powerful ninja. He then controls their bodies and forces them to fight their former allies, though they can usually still talk of their own free will. Some prove to be so tough that even when they outright explain what they're about to be forced to do, it doesn't help.

It was created by the smith Godot, as a form of protest when his lord told him to make a sword capable of killing dragons. As he thought the challenge was stupid, because dragons don't exist (well, he thought so, anyway), he proceeded to design and forge an equally stupid weapon. The result was a sword so absurdly massive and heavy that most men couldn't even <em>lift</em> it unassisted, much less use it in a fight. However, as it turned out, when Dragonslayer was put in the hands of a man who <em>was</em> strong enough to use it in a fight, it is a terrifyingly effective weapon, able to shred plate armor and slice through giant monsters.

(If the movie doesn't fail, the duo will owe the investors 753% of the movie earnings.) In order to ensure a flop, they sabotage every part of the filming process that they can. This includes hiring a completely inexperienced woman for the title role, not buying vital equipment, and employing Donald (who they believe is a huge, incompetent idiot) to do whatever needs to get done, so that he'll mess things up. Unfortunately for the film makers, Donald turns out to be excellent at all his duties... Except for when they make him a cameraman. When it's time to film the big, epic battle sequence, Donald's job is to film it from above, from the top of a pyramid. But he's exhausted from all his hard work, and sleeps through the entire shooting. And this was his only chance—the scene can't be re-shot. Then he's supposed to cut the scene, but decides that it doesn't work without the perspective from above. But one of the film makers arbitrarily re-cuts the scene while Donald is asleep, as a safeguard in case Donald turns out to be a decent editor. By pure chance, the arbitrary re-cut works excellently, and the scene ends up getting praised by critics, making the movie a huge success.

The show gives big sums of prize money to the contestants and the questions are ridiculously easy. However, Scrooge learns that he's reached the upper limit of his income tax bracket. This means that he would actually suffer a huge loss if he landed any money from the show. He doesn't want to chicken out, so he goes to the studio, but answers every question: "I don't know." The result? He receives a special bonus prize of $120,000 for being the dumbest person in the history of television.

Whenenver he gets one of these jobs, a disaster occurs which he then solves, prompting his superiors to promote him... and is forced to resign, to stay as low as possible. The story ends with his nephews congratulating him on being promoted several times despite the test stating that he would always remain in the bottom of the ladder... with Donald (looking like he's about to burst into tears) saying "Yes... but I couldn't even succeed in THAT!"
</li><li> The billionaire's club in Duckburg holds a contest awarding chess sets made of diamond, gold, or silver to the three most successful businessmen of the year, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">a worthless wooden pawn</a> to the worst one. For some reason Scrooge actually <em>wants</em> the consolation prize, and gets Donald to replace him as head of his business empire in the hopes that he'll ruin his profits for the year while Scrooge goes off on a holiday. Near the deadline he is livid to find out that Donald has actually been acting responsibly and his profits have shot through the roof. Then it's subverted when a stock market crash in the last minute makes Scrooge the biggest loser in the contest in one swoop. Oh, and the reason why he wanted the wooden piece was because it would have completed an invaluable chess set that Scrooge already owned and kept hidden in a vault.
</li><li> The Carl Barks story entitled "Spending Money" tells of Scrooge having too much money to the point that every bank in town will not take another dime of his money. So he enlists Donald and the nephews to go on a spending spree with him. They spend money on a car with ermine seat covers only to replace car after car when something is wrong with the previous one, feeding a giant troop of Junior Woodchucks, staying in expensive hotels, and buying tourist souvenirs at super high markups. In the end, the ducks end up spending none of it as Scrooge proves that he is the economy.

It quickly becomes a smash hit. (Harley even <em>wins an Oscar</em>, attending the ceremony with a police escort.) Of course, the only reason the movie was released was because the company had no choice due to all the money Harley and Ivy sunk into it, and the reason it was a hit was because people thought it was supposed to be a parody of overblown action movies and considered it epic.

Unfortunately, the Pussycats are a hit, and Mr. Cabot's club gets a six-month waiting list for people to join, earning Mr. Cabot another huge fortune.
</li><li> In another story, Jughead tried to prove that people would believe anything. To prove it, he makes up a pamphlet with bogus stock tips and puts it with Mr. Lodge's morning mail, expecting Mr. Lodge to follow the tips, lose a fortune and prove his point. The first tips earn Mr. Lodge $60,000 and get him out of another company right before it crashes, which Jughead dismisses as a fluke. Following through on the rest of the tips earns Mr. Lodge a grand total of over $2 million.

Then they deliberately get themselves thrown in prison so they can search Julius Caesar's palace (no luck), then allow themselves to be sentenced to be thrown to the lions in plans of pulling off a snatch and flee for the wreathe, only for Caesar to not be present in the audience the day of their sentencing.

Unfortunately, it has the opposite effect...and Jail TV is born.

<ul><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BeetleBailey">Beetle Bailey</a></em> comic had General Halftrack getting angry about a new television comedy show about an idiot general that looks a lot like him. He happens to run into the screenwriter getting drunk at a bar, who explains that he used to do cultural shows and was ordered to make a comedy. He then created what he saw as a terrible show in an attempt to get fired, but the show took off and he's now stuck writing it. He and Halftrack then hatch a plan to get the show off the air by writing an episode consisting solely of soldiers marching. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">The audience hates it... but the critics praise it as an avant-garde masterpiece</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Boss has tried to fire Wally on a few occasions, but the company is staffed by similar-looking bald people the Boss tend to mistake for Wally.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker">Wally's</a> problem — he wants to leave the company, but by getting fired, because that way he can get a generous severance package. Thus, he acts as incompetently as possible. The problem is that the company is manned by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">trope-naming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a>, so everything Wally does either gets the PHB's approval or is completely ignored. Oddly, this is based on someone <em>Dilbert</em> creator Scott Adams worked with, and he said, "This wouldn't have been much fun to watch, but he was one of the most brilliant people I've met, and completely committed to his goal." In the later Dilbert treasury <em>What Would Wally Do?</em>, Adams briefly mentions in his intro that said colleague did ultimately succeed in losing his job.
</li><li> Also, the following exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Dilbert:</strong> The company pays me ten dollars for every bug I fix in my code, Ratbert. I want you to do your little rat dance on my keyboard so I'll have lots of bugs to fix. <br/><strong>Ratbert:</strong> <em>[dancing around]</em> How am I doing? <br/><strong>Dilbert:</strong> Not so good. You just authored a web browser.

Mr. Dithers tells Dagwood to do poorly in the game so the newcomer will look good. Dagwood accidentally plays a great game.
</li><li> An arc of <em>Tank McNamara</em> had sports fanatic Sweatsox coaching a Little League team, and learning that to advance to the playoffs, his team had to <strong>lose</strong> the current game. So, tied in the bottom of the ninth, he sent the most out-of-shape boy to bat. Sweatsox, with a smirk, thought, "I've forfeited." The boy, however, managed to get his first hit of the year, winning the game, and was carried off on the shoulders of his cheering team; Sweatsox was furious — and his wife said sarcastically, "That's the <em>trouble</em> with kids these days. They got no sense of <em>values</em>." (Sweatsox did at least have the grace to look ashamed of himself when she said that.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhizzerAndChips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhizzerAndChips">The Bumpkin Billionaires</a></em> was a long-running UK comic strip clearly inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></em>, and entirely based around this trope. The title family won a huge sum of money, and quickly discovered that they hated being rich... and so each strip would detail a new scheme of theirs designed to lose as much money as possible, much to the despair of their bank manager. Of course, their schemes were destined to fail, often resulting in the family ending up even richer.
</li><li> Discussed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> and Jon in the November 27, 2015 strip.

<ul><li> She joins a minor political party for a cushy job as a party functionary. She winds up as Chancellor.
</li><li> Tanya provokes the Francois Republic with an eye towards being removed from power in exchange for a comfortable exile. The other Great Powers backstab the Francois Republic and basically tore up most of the Treaty of Triano.

</li><li> Tanya seeks to get voted out of office peacefully before the problems of post-War Germania can rear their ugly head. She starts a government enterprise to splinter her own ruling coalition (which contain radical Free Market Capitalists).

Their efforts to create a flop result in a blatantly pro-Nazi musical called <em>Springtime for Hitler</em>, a production starring a spaced-out hippie as Hitler. Unfortunately for the producers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">audiences mistake the musical</a> for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satire">satire</a> and love it. Because the play does not flop, the producers will be completely unable to pay back their investors, resulting in their exposure in investment fraud.

Many of Brewster's feverish attempts to waste money wind up unexpectedly making a profit. Brewster places a series of absurd longshot bets. Not only does every one hit, leaving him several hundred thousand in the black, but the word has been put out on him leaving him unable to place another big bet in Chicago. He also gives money to his friend in the hopes that he'd use it on frivolous things but the friend actually makes wise investments that make a profit. He then decides to run for mayor of New York, hoping to lose money through campaign expenses and deliberately campaigning for people to vote for "none of the above" so that he will guarantee losing the election. To his horror, the populace sees him as a breath of fresh air compared to the unlikable career politicians so they vote for him anyway, and he finds himself on the verge of winning and has to pull out.

An English Colonel sends his bumbling secretary, a disgraced U.S. soldier, a socially inept language expert, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">a transvestite</a> on a mission to steal an Enigma machine in 1944. The plan is to have them dress up as women and infiltrate the factory where the machines are made and steal one; unfortunately, the mission ends up going south from the beginning when the city they're supposed to airdrop near is just a façade. Attempting to radio command for help doesn't give them any help and nearly gives away their position. But in the end they infiltrate the factory and steal enough parts to make an Enigma machine thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">the secretary's skill with repairing typewriters</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But when the secretary comments that Germany won't even notice that a machine is missing since they only stole the parts, they realize what's really going on — the Allies already <em>have</em> an Enigma machine and have cracked its codes, so stealing one wasn't their mission. Their <em>real</em> mission was to <em>attempt</em> to steal one in such an obvious and ridiculous way that they'd be caught immediately — so that when the Germans interrogate them, they'll say that their mission was to get an Enigma. Thus the Axis would still think that the Allies didn't have one, so that the Axis powers would continue using the already-cracked codes. The secretary tries to give himself up out of a sense of duty to the Allies so that they can complete the real mission, but the others rescue him. While doing so, they make sure to try, and fail, to keep the Enigma machine. Final analysis: they subvert the trope by providing enough of a hint that they were after an Enigma machine to allow the Axis to believe it, fulfilling the true purpose of the mission while at the same time finding a way to escape captivity.</span>

The only problem is that Giacomo is not a knight and forbidden from taking part in a knightly duel. So the King, who favors Griswold, enlists "Giacomo" in a set of tests to determine whether he's worthy of knighthood or not. Giacomo/Hawkins attempts to fail the tests, but thanks to the king's guards cheating for him outrageously (challenged to "shoot a hawk in full flight", he doesn't even get his bow drawn before the carcass falls to the ground), "Candidate passes!" is the result of every one.

The client had actually oversold shares in the resort, and because Roark had a reputation for having plans so unconventional that the public would never accept them, hired him with the intent of having the motel fail and thus be able to keep the money. However, Roark's design for setting up the motel as a camp with individual cottages becomes a tremendous success, ruining the unscrupulous promoters.

Wedge Antilles is commanding the defense of a strategically important planet. He knows they can't hold it forever, so the strategy is to string along the enemy commander as long as possible by waging battles over unimportant goals, and make the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Vong</a> commander's moves predictable. However, during one of those battles, reinforcements for Wedge arrive ahead of schedule, resulting in the near-total annihilation of the Vong fleet along with their commander. This results in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> spitting out a far more competent leader to replace him, who will not be easy to predict, along with an even larger fleet.

Henry</a> story <em>The Cop and the Anthem</em> focuses on a hobo who intentionally tries to get arrested so as to go to jail during the winter by committing various petty crimes, all of which he fails to get arrested for. In the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he contemplates cleaning up his life, a cop asks him what he's doing, and he responds "Nothing" which results in his being arrested for vagrancy and spending three months in jail</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Parliament</em>, by Paul Gallico, the heroine of <em>Mrs. 'Arris Goes To Paris</em> decides to run for Parliament on the platform of "Live and let live". The (fictional) Center Party nominates her as part of a back-room deal, on the assumption that her candidacy is a joke and couldn't possibly succeed. Of course, she wins.

</li><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackReacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackReacher">Jack Reacher</a> novel, <em>Killing Floor</em>, features this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The chief of detectives in Margrave, GA, Capt.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonKorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonKorman">Gordon Korman</a> book <em>Radio Fifth Grade</em>, the school bully begins reading stories on the school's student-run radio show as part of an English project — horrific stories about pet kittens violently fighting each other. The student running the show is too intimidated to say they're terrible. When he finally gets the courage to say so, the bully admits he was intentionally writing bad stories and <em>wanted</em> someone to say so, so he could stop writing them.

Wodehouse</a> story <em>Peril at the Tee</em> involves two crappy golfers playing a round with each other. As the consequences of winning would be to neither's liking, both of them attempt to throw the game. However, the methods they employ actually improve their technique. As an example, one of them is wearing a tight-fitting jacket, figuring it will restrict his swing into total ineffectiveness. Instead, it ends up correcting his chronic overswing.
</li><li> In another P.G. Wodehouse story an honourable young man comes to believe there is insanity in his family. He must therefore end his engagement (since he cannot condemn the woman he loves to marriage with someone who may go mad), but cannot say why in order to protect his family. He decides to behave outrageously so that his fiancee will break off the engagement herself or her family forbid it. Everything he does to this end causes him to be admired all the more for manly frankness. It being Wodehouse, the fact that this potentially tragic scenario <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends happily for everyone</span> is possibly the most pointless concealment of a spoiler in the history of TV Tropes.
</li><li> Emil of Lonneberga frequently gets sent to the tool shed as punishment for pranks. His little sister Ida eventually gets jealous, and decides that she wants to go to the tool shed, too. However, most of her attempted pranks backfire into nice actions, and when she eventually manages to commit one, it (of course) gets blamed on her older brother.
</li><li> In Don DeLillo's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Libra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Libra">Libra</a></em>, the Kennedy assassination is portrayed as a plot set in motion by an ex-CIA agent who intended it to fail so that the United States would be steered into a war with Cuba. Due to postmodernist confusion, somewhere along the line the "failing" part fell out of the equation, but the facts are so fractured and disjointed that no one will ever know for certain how that happened.
</li><li> Happens in <em>How NOT to be Popular</em> by Jennifer Ziegler. Maggie attempts to make everyone hate her (or at least think she's weird) so that she won't form any attachments in her 10th high school. However, everything she does makes people like her more. For example, she decides to dress in ugly clothes from her parents' thrift shop, but ends up starting a new trend. Her parents come to school with her one day and her mother talks about how to keep your vagina tight, but all her female friends think she's cool for being so open minded. A guy even asks her on a date, and she starts political arguments with him over dinner, only for him to think it's interesting. She ends up being more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Blithe Spirit</a> to the school and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a> to the guy.

</li><li> Percival Everett's novel <em>Erasure</em> has this after an avant-garde black novelist sells out. Infuriated by the roaring success of awful ghetto fiction that turns black people into caricatures, he writes <em>My Pafology</em>, the true story of Van Go Jenkins, a youth in the ghetto. He intended it to be a blatant parody: the book itself is incredibly awful, reproduced in its entirety and written completely in Ebonics. And then it hits the bestseller list and people start wanting to meet the (completely fictional) author who wrote such a "raw and stunning work." Oops.
</li><li> In one of the later <em>Legion of the Damned</em> books by William C. Dietz, the insectoid Ramanthians have invaded a world in the Clone Hegemony. The entire thing is meant as a distraction, to draw forces away from the true objective, Earth. However, to the surprise of everyone, the clone general in charge of the planet proves to be <em>hopelessly</em> incompetent, leading to the Ramanthians not only surviving, but <em>holding</em> the world against enemy attack. At one point, the Ramanthians even call the clone general "The best General we have."
</li><li> Canadian political satire <em>The Best Laid Plans</em> by Terry Fallis follows Daniel Addison, a Liberal Party political strategist who wants to leave politics and start teaching at his alma mater. Daniel attempts to destroy his credibility by convincing Angus McLintock, his new colleague/landlord, to run for Parliament for the Liberals even though he is considered unelectable (and doesn't actually <em>want</em> to be elected, and is only running in order to get out of teaching an English course to first-year engineering students, his most hated class) in the strong Conservative riding where they live. (Exacerbating the hopelessness of the Liberal cause is that the incumbent Conservative MP is also the nationally popular Minister of Finance.) Even though Angus refuses to participate in the campaign, or indeed to let Daniel do much, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wins by a narrow margin after the incumbent gets caught doing something very stupid three days before the election, rendering <em>him</em> unelectable in the riding. Upon learning he was elected, Angus admits he never wanted or planned to become an MP. When he rolls with his election, he follows his head and rejects "politics as usual", and</span> becomes popular with the voters.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em>The High Road</em>, averts this trope <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by having Angus actively run for re-election, and win a close contest</span>.

Which rumors? The ones he started, of course. This is all so he'll get a chance to "prove" he's not psychic by predicting what will be on the exam, writing it up, having it sealed, and then revealing it after the exam has taken place. Then he fakes a family illness that requires raising a lot of money, and people start giving him "donations" for a peek at the predictions. In reality he just took a wild guess with the bare minimum of research, which he figures will be close enough to retain his mystique while avoiding any problems. Instead it turns out he was exactly right. To the very comma. He winds up going to jail.
</li><li> By the sequel, his attempts to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a> becoming all too genuine are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, as he tries to make vague pointless predictions and gets them all right.

</li><li> Double subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> novel <em>A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste</em> as a former high-school enemy of Shawn and Gus, now a millionaire, wants Shawn to use his "psychic" gifts to pick out good investments. Shawn does, but every investment goes bad and the guy reveals that he planned it this way in order to expose how Shawn is a fake psychic. This backfires on him, however, as his loyal assistant, who had believed Shawn's predictions, lost all his money investing in them and discovering that his boss did all this for a prank makes him murder the man.

Unfortunately, he fails at failing.
</li><li> In <em>The Report Card</em> by Andrew Clements, the main character Nora is a genius, but deliberately gets Ds on her report card, partly because she doesn't want to stand out, but also partly because she feels that report cards are a poor way of measuring the talent of students and is trying to prove a point. This strategy works great for her, until a man named Dr. Trindler has her take an I.Q. test. She tries the same tactic, not realizing that on this test answering just enough questions to get what would be considered a D on a school test is enough to make her a certified genius. She then later has to admit that she only got most of <em>those</em> questions wrong by doing so deliberately, revealing that she's far more intelligent than even what the test revealed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">MYTH Inc in Action</a></em>, Guido and Nunzio infiltrate the Possiltum army to try and slow its aggressive expansion down. They get assigned to run a supply depot, where they use teamsters to ship things (which turn out to be faster and cheaper than the army's internal logistics division), send summer gear in response to a unit that had requested winter gear (turns out, the order was six months old so they needed summer gear by that point), sent propaganda material to a unit that requested toilet paper (considerably improving the unit's morale), and refused to do any paperwork (considerably increasing the amount of actual work they accomplished).
</li><li> A variation in the Olivia Goldsmith novel <em>The Bestseller</em>. Gerald Ochs Davis Jr. is the son of a powerful publisher who part-owns Davis &amp; Dash Publishing. He has dreams of being a great writer but can't quite make it. So he regularly cooks the records to take the sales of other novels and attribute them to his own books so they appear to sell better. For his latest, he decides on <em>A Week in Firenze</em>, reasoning that no one will miss any numbers from a novel about a bunch of old ladies vacationing in Italy written by a first-time author. Gerald is as shocked as everyone when <em>Firenze</em> is soon topping the bestsellers lists. It doesn't take long for the auditors to realize something is off about Davis &amp; Dash claiming the biggest hit of the season isn't selling more than 30,000 copies and Gerald's scam is exposed with his own father firing him.

Instead, Miguel goes for the plan whole-hog, arranging for the victim to get transferred into county for testimony so Dexter can spring him and kill him. In retrospect, Dexter should have known that an Assistant District Attorney, especially one as popular as Prado, may have enough pull to do this.

Thus, he sells investors on funding his expedition with the promise that each of them would get half the gold he finds, overselling them by about 1500%. The explorer would then spend a small portion of the money to dive down to the wreck, "discover" that it is empty, meaning that he wouldn't have to give the investors anything, and then pocket the remaining $14 million with no one the wiser. Just as he's about to set sail, however, a shady researcher appears with a pirate captain's log that indicates the ship really <em>does</em> have gold on it but not enough to cover his promises (he'd have to pay out $100 million if he found $10 million). He thus tracked the researcher down to kill him and then arranges for a rival explorer to get the log so he'll get to the wreck first, clean it out and give the hunter an excuse for his investors why there was no gold there. Holmes and Watson actually show the key clip from the movie to cite how he was running the exact same scheme as he's arrested.

However, Spangler threatens to punish Francis personally if he <em>doesn't</em> play at his best. Eventually, Francis makes the decision to half-ass his game, but Spangler catches on and tries to <em>make</em> Francis win by intentionally playing badly. Francis returns the favor.

Kevin later admits to Mr. Belvedere that he had changed his grades from B's to D's because he was afraid of handling the responsibility of driving.
</li><li> One episode of the TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> featured a killer who developed a rather ingenious method of mailing bombs to his siblings (so he could cut them out of an inheritance), which involved breaking into US Postal Service drop boxes and gluing the bombs to the roof, before setting himself up to deliberately lose a traffic court case and end up in jail, where he'd be when the glue finally weakened, and the packages dropped into circulation; he even took the precaution of mailing a bomb to himself. Unfortunately for him, on his way to commit his traffic infraction, the future killer instead ends up in a head-on collision and in a coma, effectively giving himself the perfect alibi and removing any ability to actually use the money he's murdered his sister for.
<ul><li> Even better, Monk and Sharona begin visiting the dead woman's relatives, which include her comatose brother, her killer, staying in a hospital. Monk accidentally makes a mess and then unplugs the killer's life support to clean it up with a vacuum. When they visit the other brother the next day, Monk and Sharona learn this jolt was just enough to bring the brother out of his coma; this interview also coincides with the other brother getting his mail bomb, which Monk is able to prevent from detonating, and which ultimately leads to the comatose brother being identified as the killer.

His superior set him up for a very messy failure in order to boost his own career. Thanks to a hotshot Mossad operative named Eli David (Ziva's father), Vance not only survives but ends up being noticed by the higher-ups. The superior's further attempts aren't much better (for him, that is). Vance's career eventually leads him to become NCIS director, while the superior is relegated into obscurity.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em> storyline saw Lou Carpenter setting up a restaurant named Little Tommy Tucker's which he intended to make a loss so he could declare it a tax write off. He had the staff dress up in embarrassing Victorian street urchin style costumes and required the patrons to "sing for their supper" by doing a turn up on a stage. Inevitably, the whole thing was so kitsch that the restaurant became a success.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Pure Evil", Dave has been demoted to being Bill's producer while Lisa has taken his job as news director. In an attempt to be fired from his job and hopefully restored to his previous one, he lets Bill do a fake interview with President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>. Unfortunately, Dave is not fired, as Bill's routines garner the station its best ratings ever.
</li><li> Taken up a notch in the "Who's The Boss?" two-parter.
<ul><li> In Part 1, Lisa (recently promoted to station manager) gets sick of Bill constantly doing as he pleases, which Dave can relate to. They get the idea to make Bill boss—assuming he'll do an awful job and learn a lesson. Instead, he proves to be a magnificent boss, everything runs perfectly for the first time ever, and he abdicates his position after rubbing Dave and Lisa's noses in it.
</li><li> By the end of Part 1, Lisa doesn't want to be station manager again due to the pressure and craziness of the office. She's willing to let Dave takeover again, but he doesn't want the job by this point. (He reasons that since his demotion, he's happier and actually enjoys coming to work.) So, the trope really kicks into gear in Part 2, where Jimmy decides to hold an election for station manager. Both candidates actively try to fail (openly expressing their desire to lose, giving ridiculous answers to questions, etc.). Ultimately, Lisa wins the election, but Jimmy declares Dave "the new boss"—much to everyone's confusion. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1w3x8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1w3x8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1w3x8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The apparent logic here was that it was better to have a boss that employees respect than one they like, but as was typical for Jimmy, he didn't explain himself very well at first.</span> Though he failed at failing, the trope is subverted when Dave accepts what happened and even likes it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> has an episode where Jim tries to sabotage Dwight's speech by giving him a bunch of quotes from Mussolini, Hitler, etc., but in the end, Dwight's speech is a huge success. Jim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">apparently forgot</a> that those leaders rose to power with the help of stirring rhetoric (which was how Dwight got through to the audience).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em> 1985 Christmas special "To Hull and Back," the owner of a boat rental company agrees to let the Trotters hire one of his boats, thinking that they're certain to sink or otherwise badly damage it, which will result in a hefty insurance payout. In a subversion, while the Trotters fail to sink the boat, the owner's scheme doesn't backfire on him in any way, meaning that he still ends up with the rental fee that Del paid him, and can try the scam again at some point.
</li><li> Following a similar principle, in season 8 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, Cat tries to get himself sent to the infirmary (as part of a plan to break out of prison) by picking a fight with the biggest, nastiest inmate on the ship, by openly disrespecting him before declaring the inmate his bitch. The inmate presumes that the Cat <em>must</em> be even tougher than him to speak to him so brazenly and agrees, much to Cat's dismay.
</li><li> Blatantly used in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele">Remington Steele</a></em> as Steele and Laura investigate attempts on the life of a bad singer who, to their surprise, is headlining a sold-out music tour. Going over the books of her bosses, they realize the two have been selling the rights off to various backers for 50 percent each, figuring with the woman's lack of talent, they'd only do a couple of shows before ending the tour with a fortune. Sadly, they never counted on a millionaire becoming so obsessed with the singer that he bought out every one of her shows. In keeping with a running theme of the show, Steele openly cites the movie as the inspiration for the scheme.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911">Reno 911!</a></em> episode "We Don't Want the Pope," the Catholic Church is considering Reno as a possible city to visit, and the police have to make it look as bad as possible to prevent that from happening. It seems like this trope is in effect when the Pope's representatives say they're impressed by the way the police didn't hide their city's problems, and that they're in desperate need of help from the Church. Then it's subverted when they laugh at the idea that the Pope would ever go to Reno, spit at them, and take off in their Helicopter.

Some of his attempts include: dressing in Babe Ruth's uniform and spilling food all over it, and "streaking" on the field during a game wearing a flesh-coloured nylon bodysuit (he was too embarrassed to actually go naked). All of these end up getting him <em>praise</em> from Steinbrenner or being massively popular with the fans ("HEY! BODYSUIT GUY!"). When he <em>finally</em> commits an offense bad enough to get fired for (driving around the parking lot in his car while insulting Steinbrenner over a megaphone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">and dragging the World Series trophy from his bumper</a>), Mr. Wilhelm steps in and takes all the blame by claiming the whole thing was his idea and George was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>, getting <em>himself</em> fired instead. After Steinbrenner leaves, Wilhelm gleefully reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">he was after the same Mets job George was</a>.
</li><li> In "The Visa", George gets a new girlfriend who thinks he's the funniest guy out of all his friends. He then convinces Jerry to try not to be funny at all so the girl won't realize that George is actually not that funny. Jerry takes it to extremes and acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> around her. This backfires, as George's girlfriend ends up becoming very attracted to Jerry's "dark and disturbed" persona and says she wants to break up with George. Of course, when George tries to prove how disturbed <em>he</em> is by coming clean about the whole thing, she breaks up with him anyway.
</li><li> In "The Switch", Jerry wants to break up with his current girlfriend Sandy, who never laughs, and date her roommate who laughs at everything he says, or in other words, do "the switch". George and Jerry spend hours coming up with a plan, until eventually George comes up with this: Jerry will ask Sandy to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreewaySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreewaySex">menage a trois</a> with the roommate. This will disgust her, causing her to break up with him and tell the roommate all about how disgusting he is. The roommate will then be flattered by the request. Jerry will call at a time when he knows Sandy is at work and the roommate will go out to dinner with him. Later on, Jerry ends up trying the plan, and it backfires because both Sandy and the roommate are up for the three-way, while Jerry himself isn't "an orgy guy".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">In a later episode</a>, George is very worried when he discovers his new girlfriend has a <em>male</em> roommate who looks quite a bit like him. He figures they must be sleeping together on the side, as the two of them are so similar she must have a type. After successfully getting the roommate out of the way, George discovers to his dismay that all of the apartment's velvet furniture (George loves velvet) belonged to the roommate, and went with him when he left. Considering this a deal-breaker, he attempts to get out of the relationship by proposing a threesome. This time, not only are the girlfriend and roommate both into the idea, they had the idea <em>first</em> and were going to ask <em>him</em>.
</li><li> "The Strike" also features a variation of this trope. George hands out cards for donations made to "The Human Fund" to his co-workers so he can get out of buying them gifts. Unfortunately, he also mentions the past, which includes the celebration of Festivus, and George having to pin his father in the "Feats of Strength" which he hates. This intrigues Kramer and easily gets George's father Frank to revive the holiday and a celebration is hastily arranged on the 23rd of December. When Mr. Kruger finds out that "The Human Fund" is a fake charity, he is invited to the festvius dinner where he is nominated for the Feats of Strength but passes. Guess who does the Feats of Strength?

Cue Prof. Arturo running for mayor. He gets far, but he realizes he doesn't want this life, nor can he back out without setting back mens' rights in this dimension. So he plans to throw the election by faking an emotional breakdown during a mayoral debate to make himself look weak. However, the plan ends up backfiring. As it turns out, the reason men do not have equal rights on this world is because they are regarded as aggressive and insensitive, and Arturo's display of emotion caused many women to change their views and support him.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV">Square One TV</a></em> episode of Mathnet was a remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers">The Producers</a></em> from the audience's point of view. An over-the-hill former Broadway starlet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">Lauren Bachanall</a>, raises $2 million and puts up another $2 million of her own money for a revival of her ancient breakout hit, "Anything Went." George Frankly and Kate Monday see the show since Kate's college roommate, Eve Adams, is the number two actress. At Sardi's, the reviews come in saying that while Lauren was horrible, the play was saved by Eve's powerhouse performance. The next day, Lauren can't be found, so Eve, as understudy, takes Lauren's lead role to even greater critical acclaim. Unfortunately, the search for Lauren turns up a ransom note for $5 million and a taped message implying that Eve was in charge of the kidnapping. When Lauren is found a couple of days later, she confirms that Eve kidnapped her to take the lead role — and that Lauren gave her $2 million to the kidnappers to temporarily pacify them. After doing a little digging, the Mathnetters realize that Eve couldn't have kidnapped Lauren, because she was performing a matinee at the time. Further, the account for the show only ever had the backers' $2 million (which was withdrawn before Lauren was kidnapped). It becomes clear that Lauren wanted the show to fail so she could take the backers' money and run. When the show became a hit, she faked the kidnapping so that she could explain why her non-existent $2 million was missing. And, of course, since this is a Broadway show, the explanation is given during an "ad-libbed" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding">musical number</a>. The episode's title: "The Case of the Un-Kidnapping."

So, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Tribunal", Conservator Kovat accidentally wins his case for Chief O'Brien when Commander Sisko brings in a captured deep cover Cardassian agent that framed O'Brien with the implicit threat of exposing them.

It turns out the CEO of the company has a history of setting up companies, getting investors to pony up to 3000% more capital than he needs, putting out an app designed to fail and when the company quickly goes under, he pockets the money and shrugs it off as just another bad tech move. For once, his app actually becomes a major success, the investors wanting their money and pushing him to commit the murder in order to have the excuse to close the app down. Too bad the team figures out the truth to confront him at his press conference.

So she hires the titular character as the new coach...an American who has never coached soccer in his life. Despite that, Ted starts pushing the team into becoming winners. Ends up subverted as Rebecca realizes how many people will be put out of work if the team goes under and she refuses Ted's resignation to build the team into real winners.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>, after Tracy stars in a serious, Oscar-winning movie, he starts feeling pressured to be a more serious actor and role model, which he doesn't want at all. With Liz's guidance, he does a series of publicity stunts to get people to stop looking up to him, but either people think he's in character or forget what he was doing when he stops (at one point, he saves a man from drowning). In the end, he realized (with the help of Jack Donaghy) that all he had to do to lose respect was resume working on television.

One common method is posing as an Investigator and randomly accusing another player of being evil, the idea being that once they're lynched and prove to be innocent, you'll look like a mafia member for trying to frame them. However, Jesters don't know who the mafia is either, so it's entirely possible that the person you choose <em>actually is evil</em>, meaning now people are convinced that you're important and should not be lynched, while the actual Mafia starts to gun for you (and the Jester loses if killed at night).

Ben didn't like the fact that the game was partially competitive, with each table scoring a point whenever they found a clue to completing the story, because he thought that this would discourage tables from roleplaying and decided to avoid having his table be the one to win by running the game slowly and doing stuff to waste time.

Worried that someone might overshadow him, Smithers decides to find someone so incompetent that he'll have to return early (and after 714 matches, decides just to have Homer take over). Unfortunately, Homer is so terrible that Mr. Burns quickly learns how to do everything himself, allowing him to fire Smithers once he returns.
</li><li> In "Homer's Enemy", Frank Grimes tries to humiliate Homer Simpson and show the world how much of a buffoon Homer is by tricking him into entering a power plant model-designing contest for kids. Except Homer wins the top prize. This <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pushes Grimes far off the edge, and he goes on a rampage resulting in his own death</span>.
</li><li> In "Team Homer", Mr. Burns's performance is dragging down Homer's bowling team, so Moe says Burns might end up having a little "accident". As Burns limps into the bowling alley, complaining of a knee injury and saying he'll have to withdraw, Moe leaps out (in a ski mask) and bashes his knee with a tire iron, popping it back into place and allowing him to stay on.
</li><li> In "Homer Scissorhands", Homer becomes a successful hairdresser, but soon tires of having to hear his female clients going on and on about their lives while he cuts their hair. In an effort to drive away business, he deliberately attempts to cut a client's hair badly...and ends up giving her a spectacular haircut that wows everyone.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> example comes up in "Bart the Mother" when Nelson dares Bart to shoot a bird perched up on a nearby tree with his new BB gun. Not wanting to be thought of as a coward for not shooting but not wanting to kill a harmless bird either, Bart attempts to screw up his shot and miss by intentionally aiming far away from where its nest is. Unfortunately, he doesn't know that the BB gun has a crooked aim, and firing away causes him to perfectly shoot right through the bird's neck and kill it instantly to his horror. To make up for killing the mom, Bart does nurse the two eggs to hatching, but they are Bolivian Tree Lizards which end up populating themselves in Springfield and kill off the pigeon population.
</li><li> In "Bart on the Road", Bart chooses to stay home with Marge on "Go to Work With Your Parents Day", insisting that it's his way of showing support for women in the workplace. After Marge reads that being a housewife makes her ineligible, Lisa slyly notes that Patty and Selma are two professional women, resulting in Marge deciding it would be good for Bart to spend a day at the DMV. Bart, of course, is horrified.

Instead of accepting, Garrison and his 'assistant' demonstrated the kind of behavior that scared the kids, only to be further applauded for his 'courage'. He screams at the assembled crowd that he should have been fired for his behavior regardless of his sexuality, and actually asked to be fired so that he could sue. While it made the parents realize their kids weren't homophobic, just disgusted with Mr. Garrison, and didn't deserve to be sent to tolerance camp, Garrison ended up sent there; while the reason given was that "[he] isn't tolerant of [his] own behavior", the real reason was punishment by the principal for trying to bilk money from the school.

Finally, the owner begs the dogs to call off one last roulette bet, but too late. Instead, he offers to take over the bet, and when the dogs insist on 100 trips through the hot dog buffet and a limo ride out of town, he agrees.

To test it, he wrote a paper ("Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity") that argued <em>gravity</em> was merely a social construct, loaded it with fashionable buzzwords, and deliberately wrote and edited to make the paper as completely nonsensical as possible. The hope was that such a ridiculous paper would be caught in peer review and rejected. Not only was the paper published, it was praised and circulated through several academic journals before Sokal came out and admitted that the whole thing was a hoax.
</li><li> Taking a page from Sokal, James A.

By the time they admitted the hoax, only six were rejected. Four had been published, three had been accepted for publication, seven were still under review. One of the published papers had won special recognition in its field.

Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible">the painting ended up being very well received by critics</a>, and he went on to paint several more before revealing that the entire thing was a hoax.
</li><li> The "Dada" movement also around the '20s was a potshot at man's unquestioning admiration of anything labeled "Art" which would be put into galleries. Dadaists such as Marcel Duchamp used things like urinals, postcards of the Mona Lisa with a mustache painted on it, and objects intended to be destroyed, offensive and otherwise without any major artistic qualities. Guess where many surviving Dada works have ended up?
</li><li> Back in 1937, while Nazi Germany was promoting art glorifying Nazi ideology, they also decided to stage one show of "proper" German art, and another of "degenerate art" to allow people to be properly disgusted by the supposedly perverse, anti-religious, "Jewish-Bolshevist" modern art. The exhibition of "degenerate" art attracted <em>over two million visitors</em>, almost four times as many as the Nazi-approved art, making it one of the largest modern art shows of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

The first letters he drew only needed one extra letter added to make an 8-letter word. In Scrabble, using all seven tiles in a player's rack at once awards the player an additional fifty points. There was no seven-letter word that could be played using the letters on his rack, so if he wanted the 50-point bonus, he needed to play his 8-letter word. Unfortunately, he had the first move. So, he decided to give up his turn by playing a word which he believed was not real, getting his opponent to challenge it off the board so that he could use all his letters on his next turn.

She crammed it full of deconstructions of comedy itself (as a tension and a release), details of her own history with trauma and internalized prejudice, a <em>brutal</em> takedown of male privilege and misogyny, and an explanation of why she's quitting — she can't stand to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">make</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">herself</a> and other minorities the butt of jokes anymore. In her words, it was meant to divide audiences and get her removed from the Australian festival circuit. Well, folks, you might have heard of the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> special, <em>Nanette</em>, which took the Internet by storm and made Gadsby an international sensation in mid-2018.

However, the writer was fed up with being forced to write along with what was popular at the time and decided he had enough of the business. At the encouragement of his wife, he plotted to create a team book like his publisher wanted, but instead of what was conventional at the time, he'd fill the book with all kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>. Believing that nobody would want to read what <em>he'd</em> like to read, the writer expected for the book to be a major flop so he can bail out of the comics industry and pursue screenwriting for Hollywood. The book? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFantasticFour">The Fantastic Four</a></em>. The writer? <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a></strong></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Bloom County</a></em> creator Berke Breathed attempted to troll his audience by introducing an anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a>, the most unappealing cat character he could devise. This character was Bill the Cat — who unexpectedly proved very popular with the comic's fanbase and soon within the fictional world as well.
</li><li> This is why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ZippyThePinhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ZippyThePinhead">Zippy the Pinhead</a></em> got syndicated at all. Alan Priaulx, the comics editor for King Features at the time, called Bill Griffith, who has been drawing the strip for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and offered him a syndication contract. Being an underground cartoonist, Griffith was wary of having his strip distributed by a mainstream company, so he made a list of 20 demands, figuring they wouldn't go for it. To his shock, Priaulx said yes to all. Griffith later found out why Priaulx was so accommodating when he quit his job at King Features a few months later: he was unhappy with his job at King and wanted to leave, but he wanted to leave with a bang. <em>Zippy</em> was picked up as a "ticking time bomb" for the syndicate. This trope also applies to Priaulx, as the strip is still running in newspapers to this day, the "bomb" not exploding.
</li><li> During the 1940s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a> created a series of political cartoons mocking, among other things, the fascist "America First" movement. Some of them featured cartoonishly exaggerated racial stereotypes to poke fun at how insanely racist American society was becoming thanks to things such as Pearl Harbor and Franklin D. Roosevelt's misguided plan of placing Japanese-Americans in internment camps. Years later in the 2010s, some people on the left re-discovered them and promptly went around trying to use it as proof that Dr. Seuss <em>was</em> a racist without even bothering to check if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">Poe's Law</a> was in effect for them.

Since his stand-up comedy career was starting to flourish, and because he considered the role an offensive stereotype, he decided he'd go in and treat the audition as a complete joke, completely mocking the role and the producers.

What's hilarious is that he's supposed to be one of the villains. So, time and again, the author tries to write him as an unlikable prick. Unfortunately his turn to evil due to terrible circumstances beyond his control (not to mention that he is literally <em>forced</em> to be evil) makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> and gives him more of a character arc than the main character!

</li><li> According to crime novelist Val McDermid (the author behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WireInTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WireInTheBlood">Wire in the Blood</a></em>), this is basically what happened when she wrote her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery">children's picture book</a> <em>My Granny is a Pirate</em>. For a while there was a trend of celebrities writing children's books, and McDermid's publisher wanted her to write one too, and refused to listen when she said that that was a particular skill she didn't possess, so she sent her a poem she had made up for her son when he was younger.
<div class="indent"><strong>McDermid:</strong> But eventually, she just kept going on and on <em>and on</em>, and the only way I thought to shut her up, was to send her something. [...] So I had written this, well, I had made up really, I hadn't even written it down to begin with, this poem about my granny being a pirate. You know: <em>"My granny is a pirate! She sailed the seven seas. She's captured many pirate ships, but was always home for tea."</em> And I sent this off to my publisher thinking; at least she'll shut up and leave me alone now, but no. No no no. She called me and said: "Darling, we love it! We want to publish it, darling!" And I'm like; <em>Oh, for Christ's sake...</em>

They wrote sixteen deliberately bad poems under the pseudonym which they then submitted to the popular modernist magazine <em>Angry Penguins</em> in an attempt to embarrass its founder Max Harris. Naturally, Harris fell for the hoax and devoted the next issue to Malley. When the con was revealed, he was humiliated and subsequently fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they were obscene, and his magazine ceased publishing in 1946. While the hoax proved to be a major setback for the cause of Australian modernist literature, it was not long before the Ern Malley poems became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right in spite of their well-known status as a forgery.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV">SCTV</a></em>'s Bob and Doug McKenzie were created as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBC">CBC</a>; after the program moved to the network, CBC requested that they add two minutes of "distinctively Canadian content" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> since it was running shorter due to having fewer commercials. The show's staff felt that the request was ridiculous; in particular, performers Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas jokingly suggested that they should just put up a map of Canada and act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">stereotypically Canadian as possible</a>. Moranis and Thomas ended up doing exactly that, and wound up creating the most popular characters in the show's history, as Canadians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicansLoveSpeedyGonzales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicansLoveSpeedyGonzales">loved the mocking stereotype of themselves</a>.
</li><li> A somewhat similar case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> occurred during the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> wanted more broad, kid-friendly comedy in the show. Producer Hugh Wilson wrote "Fish Story" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to the executives, a broad farce with silly costumes (Herb in the WKRP "carp" costume fighting the WPIG pig), pratfalls, and contrived explanations. Wilson hated the episode, and wrote it under a pseudonym as the last episode in CBS's initial 13-episode order. It got great ratings, and has always been one of the fans' favorite episodes.
</li><li> This was what happened behind the scenes of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>. The short version: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> expected the series to fail, and that they could make money from its failure. The series succeeded, so ABC found a way to make it fail anyway — and they ultimately failed to make any money in the end. The long version: <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> was a <em>very</em> expensive series, and ABC executives only greenlit it because they thought it would flop. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Operas</a> were huge at that moment (thanks, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>!), but execs were expecting audiences to get bored with the genre very quickly. ABC wanted a loss-leader to take advantage of this trend: the logic was that people would tune in for <em>Galactica</em>, then stick around for one of ABC's cheap sitcoms once they got bored with sci-fi. No other sci-fi TV series since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> had lasted beyond one season, so <em>Galactica</em> flopping seemed like a good bet. In spite of the prevailing wisdom, <em>Galactica</em> proved to be a huge hit, putting ABC in the position of having a show that was too popular to cancel, but too expensive to continue producing. ABC resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screwing the show over</a> to drive down viewership to the point where they could cancel it without <em>completely</em> losing face. And the real kicker: the stunt didn't help the ratings of ABC's sitcoms at all. None of that season's new series were hits, and last season's big hit, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy">Mork &amp; Mindy</a></em>, bled ratings thanks to a bad re-tooling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> William Windom, who played Commodore Matt Decker in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode "The Doomsday Machine", thought the entire episode was just silly and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">ham it up</a>, treating it as if he was in some cartoon. This ended up making his character very memorable due to the captain's unhinged state and today it's said that this was one of his most memorable roles.
</li><li> Avery Brooks, who played Captain Sisko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, supposedly didn't want the part originally, but was talked into it by his wife, who was a <em>Star Trek</em> fan. Consequently, his audition came across as grumpy and not entirely wanting to be there... which turned out to be <em>exactly</em> what the producers wanted for the character (at least at first). The show managed to find its place as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> look at the universe at the time and drew viewers for that alternate perspective. It ran for seven seasons, and despite wanting to leave the show, Brooks stuck it out because he wanted to teach his son a lesson about honoring one's commitments.
</li><li> Robert Beltran, who played Chakotay in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, got so fed up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of his character and the quality of the show as a whole that he demanded an extraordinarily large pay raise in order to stay on the cast, hoping that his bosses would ditch him rather than pay such a huge amount. They simply forked over the money. <em>Voyager</em> managed to find its legs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">ran for seven seasons as well</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Jason Narvy tried out for the role of Skull in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, he was tired of the entertainment industry, and proceeded to act as obnoxious as possible during the audition so he'd be sure to bomb it. Seeing as how Skull was one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a> and a total bully in-universe, this ended up getting Narvy the part.
</li><li> Much of the continued success of the franchise can be attributed to this trope. When Haim Saban managed to get his adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</a></em> greenlit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> expected to run the show for one 40-episode season and be done with it. Then the ratings and toy sales came in, and <em>Power Rangers</em> was the biggest hit of its time. They quickly commissioned more footage from Toei and renewed the show at the last minute, hurriedly editing the intended finale.
</li><li> After the disappointment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> (which suffered for trying to adapt the footage from parody Sentai <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger">Gekisou Sentai Carranger</a></em> into a serious storyline), the budget was severely cut and the show was entering its intended final season. The footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger">Denji Sentai Megaranger</a></em> turned out to be technology-based. Judd Lynn decided to move forward with a <em>Power Rangers</em> series based on a space story. Not only did the resulting series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> save the franchise, it turned out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> moment for the series and the standard for future <em>Power Rangers</em> seasons.
</li><li> The bulk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s ownership of the show is this. Disney acquired the rights in their purchase of Fox Family and related assets. They weren't interested all that much in <em>Power Rangers</em>, so they intended to end the series with the expiration of Saban's original deal with Toei after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em> (even titling the finale "The End of Power Rangers", meant as just that). Then, two former <em>Power Rangers</em> writers and producers then elsewhere at Disney talked them into moving production to New Zealand for tax benefits, and the show continued to be a success... until Disney's apathy towards the show became more apparent. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>, Disney tried to end the series again, but Bandai convinced them to do another season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">because of toy sales</a> often outperforming the show itself in that time. The Sentai footage was from another parody Sentai, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger">Engine Sentai Go-onger</a></em>. Executive producer Eddie Guzelian (replaced midstream by Lynn due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>) adapted it into a serious storyline, which is what they tried to do with <em>Turbo</em> above, only this time it worked. The resulting series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>, is incredibly well-regarded for its story, and could have been the most successful series since <em>In Space</em>. Most ABC affiliates, including Disney-owned stations and stations in nearly all major markets, ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screwing the show over</a> to a graveyard early-morning slot or not airing it at all, which finally ended the series, save for the 2010 re-version of <em>MMPR</em>. Then, Saban bought the rights to the franchise again, moved airing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, and <em>Power Rangers</em> returned to being a top-rated TV show and best-selling toyline.
</li></ul></li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState">The State</a></em> was pressured to write more catchphrase-driven comedy like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, so they wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> sketch starring "Louie, the Guy Who Says His Catchphrase Over and Over Again." In it, Louie repeats his catchphrase, "I wanna dip my balls in it!" over and over again to a crowd who find it hilarious every single time, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> criticizes the concept. The skit was pretty popular and the character made at least one reappearance.
</li><li> The success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons">The Waltons</a></em> was a complete accident; it being a show that would've fallen victim to the "rural purge" had it been broadcast any earlier, CBS put it in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot">Friday Night Death Slot</a> in a deliberate attempt to sabotage it. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail">it backfired spectacularly, and it became one of the network's biggest hits of the '70s instead</a>.
</li><li> A meta-example: For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGongShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGongShow">The Gong Show</a></em>, producer Chuck Barris regularly brought in acts that were overly sexually suggestive on purpose to act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorDecoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorDecoy">Censor Decoys</a>. On at least one occasion, one of these acts actually made it to air.
</li><li> In 1993, when Cologne-based station Viva TV prepared for launch, local musician <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StefanRaab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StefanRaab">Stefan Raab</a> payed them a visit intending to produce jingles for them, but somehow found himself at a casting for presenters. He didn't want the job, so he completely misbehaved, only to end up with his own comedy show. This did give his music some nice exposure, but his shows eventually became so successful that he presumably became too tired to record more than just the occasional, infrequent single. Even after retiring from TV in 2015, he hasn't recorded any new music since <em>1997</em> (though he did mastermind Germany's Eurovision 2010 victory).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeanMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeanMartin">Dean Martin</a> had no intention of doing a weekly variety show and asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> for an enormous salary and insisted that his contract include clauses that allowed him to skip rehearsals and refuse to do retakes among other outrageous demands. NBC agreed to every single demand and Dean felt honor-bound to do it. The show ended up running for 9 years, followed by the <em>Dean Martin Celebrity Roast</em> specials that ran for an additional 10 years. True to his word, however, Dean refused to rehearse or shoot retakes and was usually in his car and well on his way home before shooting even wrapped for the day.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> example posted above, about Ireland trying to get out of hosting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> was based on a real life example. RTÉ allegedly selected an inferior song for the 1994 contest so they wouldn't have to face the daunting (and financially crippling) task of hosting a third consecutive contest. Not only did "Rock 'n' Roll Kids" win, it became the highest-scoring song in Eurovision history up to that point.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/o-rBz6vhldY">Friends of the People<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> speculates that this is what happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>- that Steve Urkel was introduced right as the series had initially been cancelled after 10 episodes, and the character was so terrible that the writers were trying to bring down the network with it. Unfortunately, the character got so popular that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">they kept having to write him, and every stupid thing they did with him, the audience ate up</a></em>.
</li><li> After the sixth series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> in 1993, co-writer Rob Grant departed the show, leaving his writing partner Doug Naylor to continue the series by himself. Despite pressure from the BBC, Naylor was reluctant to carry on solo, and asked his agent to put in a deliberately ridiculous budget request for the seventh series which the BBC would reject. His agent ended up putting in a request for a "sensibly ridiculous" budget — i.e. one so large he thought the BBC would definitely still reject it, but not so obviously unrealistic that the BBC would realise they were deliberately trying to get it turned down. The BBC agreed to fund it.
</li><li> In 1993, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoelsHouseParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoelsHouseParty">Noels House Party</a></em> introduced the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBlobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBlobby">Mr Blobby</a>, a deliberately ridiculous parody of children's TV characters who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">only speaks in the repeated phrase "blobby blobby blobby!"</a>, for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandidCameraPrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandidCameraPrank">Gotcha</a> segments. He was intended to particularly embarrass the celebrities and arguably mock them for not realising that such a moronic character would never get his own show. He then became massively popular with children and he became a serious children's show character, and even got his own merchandise (ranging from a pink lemonade soft drink to a no. 1 hit record to even two distinct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKiddieRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKiddieRide">kiddie rides</a>).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> was in the midst of a creative dispute with his label Geffen Records, due to his 1982 experimental techno-rock album <em>Trans</em>, which flopped. Young recorded and had intended to release the straight country album <em>Old Ways</em> next, but it was rejected by Geffen, who requested Young to release a rock album instead. Not one to take such executive meddling in stride, Young recorded <em>Everybody's Rockin</em>', an intentionally silly rockabilly album in hopes to anger Geffen enough to get out of his contract. The result was a lawsuit and counter lawsuit from both parties.
</li><li> The quintessential example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalMachineMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalMachineMusic">Metal Machine Music</a></em>: a double album consisting exclusively of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">layered feedback from multiple instruments</a>. It became a minor success, selling over 100,000 copies, singlehandedly invented the Noise genre of music (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">particularly popular in Germany and Japan</a>) and strongly influenced Industrial music. Most people assumed that Reed made it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">a big middle finger to the record company</a>, but Reed has denied this, saying that he was completely serious at the time, but was also on a lot of drugs.
</li><li> Another good example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeachBoysParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeachBoysParty">Party</a></em>, an album of covers thrown together quickly, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords">Capitol</a> wanted to have a release available for the holiday shopping season, and the planned album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds">Pet Sounds</a></em> was being delayed due to Brian Wilson's perfectionism. The last song on the album, a cover of Fred Fasset's "Barbara Ann", became a surprise hit, charting at #2, although not initially released as a single; while the album itself hit the top 10 at #6.
</li><li> Lampshaded with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/MontyPythonsContractualObligationAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/MontyPythonsContractualObligationAlbum">Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album</a></em>, which was originally released with the tagline "Now a Major Lawsuit". The album actually <em>was</em> produced to finish out a contract, and listening to it, it's clear that the Pythons didn't put much effort into it. Over half the album is songs and brief spoken word pieces by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle">Eric Idle</a>, and the rest is new recordings of old material that the Pythons had written for other projects. But because it's Monty Python, it's still hilarious.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield">Mike Oldfield</a>'s <em>Amarok</em> album includes "fuck you rb" in Morse code, targeted at Virgin's boss Richard Branson. Since Virgin had been pressing him to produce more tracks that could be released as singles, <em>Amarok</em> was deliberately constructed as a solid 60 minutes that is impossible to cut into a single. Many consider it his best album. Mike's page has an entire section of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> examples dedicated to showing all the different ways <em>Amarok</em> is a big middle finger to Mr. Branson.
</li><li> Love and Rockets (post-punk/synth-rock band consisting of former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Bauhaus</a> members) did one of these with their side project "The Bubblemen" — a single release consisting of "The Bubblemen Are Coming", "Bubblemen Rap", and "Bees", and featuring the band dressed in bee costumes — as a "blowing off steam" variation of this trope. The project quickly became a cult hit; and they often performed as The Bubblemen as part of their regular concerts.
</li><li> In the late '60s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> recorded an entire album of deliberately, unreleaseably awful songs (The Big Royalty Check, Ringworm, Here Comes Dumb George) in order to get out of his contract with Bang Records. This ended up backfiring on him in the early '90s, when the cash-strapped rights-holders began licensing them out... on "Greatest Hits" compilations, no less.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles">Sara Bareilles</a> was forced by her record company to write a love song for her album <em>Little Voice</em>. So, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">Writer Revolt</a> kicked in with "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi7Yh16dA0w&amp;ob=av2e">Love Song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which specifically goes "I'm not gonna write you a love song". Ironically, it was her first hit. Same story with her second hit "King of Anything"... so which party gets to say "I told you so"?
</li><li> British extreme metallers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CradleOfFilth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CradleOfFilth">Cradle of Filth</a> were sick of their then-current label Cacophonous Records, yet were pigeonholed into making a new release before they could leave the label. The result was the EP <em>Vempire (Or Dark Faarytales In Phallustein)</em>, which many fans of the band consider to be their best release.
</li><li> The power chords to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REOSpeedwagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REOSpeedwagon">REO Speedwagon</a>'s "Keep On Loving You" were a similar reaction by guitarist Gary Richrath to singer Kevin Cronin's song, which Gary thought was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">sappy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery">uncharacteristic</a> of the hard-rock group. The combination became an early example of the '80s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a>", and their first number one single.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>'s <em>The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect</em> is another one of these. He intentionally wrote "Bang The Drum All Day" to be as stupid as possible and it's quite possibly his most recognizable hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a> originally intended their album <em>Duck Stab!</em> to prove that even if they released an album of songs that actually followed traditional song structure, still no-one would buy it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">It became one of their most popular.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles">The Turtles</a>, a surf band turned folk-rock band from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">who had cheery bubblegum hits</a> like "Happy Together" and "She'd Rather Be With Me", was having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">problems with their label</a>, White Whale, who wanted them to keep churning out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">more commercial product</a> while the band wanted to move into more progressive music. So they wrote the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">deliberately banal</a> pop song they could, "Elenore". It obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">was not taken as such</a>, and became a Top Ten hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> guitarist Slash was "joking around" with a riff. He hated it. Axl Rose loved it. Over objections within the band, the track was recorded for their album-in-progress. The result? "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Child_o%27_Mine">Sweet Child O'Mine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", a song Slash reportedly "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oobDQ0vdm8M">really fucking hated to play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" during their gigs. Slash had to spend <em>a month</em> recording that riff in the studio to get it just right for the album.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> mocked that riff at the end of their 1989 song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYbwdBQhzlM">Punk Rock Classic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." That song's chorus begged "Put us on MTV/ Help me, please, please, please..." One album later, the Peppers' ballad "Under the Bridge" landed them in heavy rotation on MTV — and on subsequent albums, their music has sounded less like "Punk Rock Classic" and more like "Under the Bridge".
</li></ul></li><li> Steam's "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye", intended as a throwaway B side, instead a #1 hit. In fact, the overly-long chorus repetition at the end was specifically intended to be annoying. The plan was to encourage disc jockeys to only play the A side. The plan didn't work.
</li><li> Add Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive", Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a>'s "Beth" to the list of successful B-side hits (though the last one didn't hit #1).
</li><li> "Barely Breathing" by Duncan Sheik was similar, intended to be a filler song to bring the album up to proper length; it became his only hit (unless you count the music he did for "Spring Awakening").
</li><li> Same with Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting". After spending over two hours on A-side song "I Want to Give You My Everything", he recorded his immortal one-hit wonder in a little more than ten minutes!!!
</li><li> German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Krautrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Krautrock">Krautrock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Neu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Neu">Neu!</a>'s budget ran out during the recording of their second album after completing one side of an album. Short of material, they included the previously released single sides "Super" and "Neuschnee", and decided to fill the rest of the second side with sped-up and slowed-down versions of those two songs. In the process, they pretty much invented the remix.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a> were asked to contribute a fast, driving song for a scene of the film <em>With Honors</em> wherein one of the characters runs through the snow. They offered up an instrumental they'd already written and recorded, but the studio insisted on a song with words. So the band added minimal throwaway lyrics to their instrumental, called the result "Run Shithead Run" and sent back both this version and the original, figuring the studio would either reject them outright or just use the instrumental after all. The version of the song with lyrics still ended up in the movie and its soundtrack album... But the band noted they were never asked to contribute music to a major motion picture again.
</li><li> In 1976, amateur musician John Trubee, then a teenager, found an ad in a tabloid for a song poem company<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zdkd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5zdkd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zdkd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That is, a company that takes lyrics from the clients and has studio musicians perform them</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> wanted to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s third album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero">In Utero</a></em>, a noisy punk album in an attempt to get rid of the mainstream audience they'd picked up with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind">Nevermind</a></em>. It still shot to number one on the <em>Billboard</em> charts.
</li><li> The metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR">GWAR</a> got its start this way. Originally, the members were in a different band called Death Piggy, but in a few concerts, they tried a publicity stunt in which they posed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand">Fake Band</a> dressing up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan</a></em>-esque barbarian costumes (borrowed from a film they were making at the time) and running around screaming obscenities in the idea that after the audience was subjected to this, Death Piggy's arrival would come as a relief. To their surprise, many fans would stay for GWAR and leave when Death Piggy made their entrance, so they decided to play as GWAR full-time.
</li><li> During the height of Psychedelia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies">The Hollies</a> (particularly Graham Nash) tried hard to develop a more elaborate, "serious" sound. The results, namely the single "King Midas in Reverse", were met with commercial indifference, prompting the label to demand something more marketable. In response, the band recorded the deliberately cheesy bubblegum song "Jennifer Eccles". It was a Top Ten hit, much to Nash's dismay.
</li><li> As a joke, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValliAndTheFourSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValliAndTheFourSeasons">The Four Seasons</a> recorded a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright" with intentionally silly, self-parodic falsetto vocals, which they never intended to actually release. Their record company liked it enough to release it as a single anyway: Even though it was released under the name The Wonder Who? for contractual reasons, it reached #12 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 chart and sold a million copies.
</li><li> Speaking of Dylan, he has often claimed that his much-reviled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelfPortrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelfPortrait">Self Portrait</a></em> album from 1970 was intended as one of these.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt">Anal Cunt</a> attempted to make the worst music ever with music so abrasive it's difficult to tell what notes are even being played. They coupled this with lyrics that were frequently misogynistic, racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, or otherwise offensive. Their singer, the late Seth Putnam, even admitted sending copies of their albums to reviewers who they knew would dislike it solely so they could get negative reviews. They wound up being admired by people who saw through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> and are one of the most influential bands of the grindcore genre. They even attempted making an album that even their fans wouldn't like, <em>Picnic of Love</em>. The album is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">the opposite of their usual output</a>, featuring acoustic songs with Seth Putnam wailing in an obnoxiously high-pitched falsetto about respecting women. Many fans consider it their funniest and even critics gave it much more favorable reviews than their usual output.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">Quiet Riot</a> were asked to do a cover of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slade">Slade</a> song "Cum on Feel the Noize" as a demo for their record company. Kevin Dubrow <em>hated</em> the song, refused to do more than one take, and put zero effort into it (there's an audible sound error at one point — he demanded the band keep playing because he didn't want to have to start over). The song made their entire careers.
</li><li> Similarly, Sammy Davis Jr.'s version of "The Candy Man" was his biggest hit, spending three weeks at #1. This is in spite of his recording it in one syrupy, sanctimonious, and condescending take, and then grumbling about how the song would "take his career down the toilet". Seeing as he was probably still bitter over being passed up for the role of Bill the candy store owner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, it really could have.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.black-sabbath.com/2004/06/depeche_mode/">According to designer Steve Joule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, this is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s <em>Born Again</em> cover art came to be: Joule was known for designing Ozzy Osbourne's album covers, and was asked by Sabbath's management to submit some rough designs for the band's next album. Fearing he might lose his main gig if he worked with Ozzy's former band, he decided to throw together some intentionally silly, hideous artwork in the hopes of getting rejected. One of these designs was a stock photo of a crying baby crudely altered to look like a demon, which of course actually ended up being on the cover — Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Black Sabbath manager Don Arden reportedly approved of the design. On the other hand, then-vocalist Ian Gillan didn't see the artwork until it was already in stores, and was famously quoted (in a 1984 <em>Kerrang!</em> interview) as saying I looked at the cover and puked!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> was one of a number of established artists who found the transition to the 80s difficult. Cash blamed it on poor promotion by his record company and recorded the intentionally awful "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_uM87NTFW4">Chicken in Black<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" in attempt to get out of his contract. It actually worked, but it also became his biggest hit in some time.
</li><li> Australian pop singer Marty Rhone thought he was going to die in Vietnam and recorded "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrgJMDONqXw">So You Want to Be a Pop Singer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to the music industry. The song, which references then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown">Countdown (2017)</a></em> host Molly Meldrum, Russell Morris's hit "The Real Thing" and Elvis Presley, is pretty tame by today's standards and didn't come across as particularly scathing in 1970 either. It failed to chart, but it didn't sink Rhone's career either.
</li><li> As an experiment, a "Most Unwanted Song" was created by combining a whole bunch of themes and instruments that people claimed to hate. Not surprisingly, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2008/04/a-scientific-at/">it's hilarious<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. (And far better than the "Most Wanted Song" they made to go with it.)
</li><li> Norwegian comedy duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis">Ylvis</a>, comprising brothers Vegard and Bård Ylvisåker, made "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE">The Fox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", an intentionally nonsensical little ditty destined to go viral. They had done a favor for production team Stargate, and in return asked that Stargate produce "The Fox" to promote the new season of Ylvis' TV talk show <em>I kveld med YLVIS</em>, the joke being that they had a chance at finally becoming pop stars but they did a nonsensical song that was destined to flop instead. Contrary to what they predicted, the song very quickly caught on and ended up being immensely successful on the charts instead of staying the joke Ylvis had originally created. The fact that another foreign novelty, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY">Gangnam Style</a>", was still fresh in many peoples' minds probably helped too.
<div class="indent">"The whole humor is that we didn't succeed and had lots of obstacles. The obstacles generated the comedy. Then suddenly we're on this trip to America, the place people want to go, and there's no obstacles. Every doorway is open... and there's no comedy."

It became their best known song.
</li><li> With the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewYorkDolls">New York Dolls</a>, vocalist David Johansen didn't achieve any commercial success, as his band was mostly a cult favorite as a forerunner of both American punk and glam rock. It was only when he launched his lounge singer alter-ego Buster Poindexter in 1987 that he became a commercial success, with "Hot Hot Hot" nearly cracking Billboard's Top 40. Johansen is now back with the Dolls, having long grown his hair back and ditched the suits he used to wear as his Poindexter alter-ego. In an interview, Johansen referred to "Hot Hot Hot" as "the bane of my existence", suggesting that he never intended for the song to become so popular.
</li><li> Famously, the "crunch" sounds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s "Creep" were an attempt to sabotage the song. The band left it in, and in part because of the crunches (which made an otherwise mellow song sound much harder, creating a dissonance that synergized well with the subject matter (intense personal self-loathing)), it became their first hit.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows">Todd in the Shadows</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SirMixALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SirMixALot">Sir Mix-a-Lot</a> song "Baby Got Back" was one of these. It was apparently designed to fail. As you might have guessed, it didn't. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">Not by a long shot.</a>
</li><li> The early rock and roll song "Little Darlin'" by the Diamonds was originally meant to be a parody of rock and roll. It's regarded as a classic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s "Albuquerque", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking">which clocks in at 11 minutes</a>, was written to frustrate listeners by being a long, meandering story that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">didn't go anywhere</a>, ending with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> about how the narrator hates sauerkraut. It became a fan favorite.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickLowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickLowe">Nick Lowe</a> wrote "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Bay City Rollers</a>, We Love You" to be as bad as possible in the hopes that his label would drop him. Instead, it turned out to be so catchy that it was released worldwide. It flopped everywhere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">except Japan</a>.
</li><li> Michael Sembello was asked to provide a song for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flashdance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flashdance">Flashdance</a>. Not liking any of the results, and frustrated by the lack of progress, he recorded the musical equivalent of a tasteless joke by making up a song celebrating the antics of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherFilm">Slasher Film</a> maniac carving up victims. His wife accidentally sent it to the film producers. Sembello got a call, saying the producers <em>loved</em> the song. Understandably, a lyric change was needed. It ended up a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(Michael_Sembello_song)">Number One hit.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Feeling pressure to deliver a hit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThrowingMuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThrowingMuses">Throwing Muses</a> wrote "Dizzy" in an effort to show how stupid it is to consciously try to write one. "We hated it even while we were recording it", Kristin Hersh said. "We expected them to get the point and they didn't at all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">they loved it</a>."
</li><li> When The Church were recording "Under The Milky Way Tonight", vocalist/bassist Steve Kilbey waited until everyone else left the studio and added a backwards bagpipe sample to an instrumental section of the song as a joke. The producer and the band loved it and it was left in the final mix of the song, which became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> for the group.

<ul><li> Pastafarianism (a.k.a. the church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster), originally an in-joke among agnostics regarding the "man in the sky" interpretation of religion, wound up going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> enough that it has a following equal to a practiced religion and has legally recognized priests.

<ul><li> In 1970, Earl Brydges, majority leader of the New York State Senate<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ex2u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ex2u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ex2u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and thus one of the three most powerful politicians in the state</span> wanted to head off attempts to legalize abortion in the state. Some were before the legislature, but he decided to supersede them all by writing his own bill, even more liberal than any introduced by more liberal legislators, with the idea that it would be too liberal to pass and thus he could put off the reformers by pointing to the failed bill. However, it passed, and after a tense moment when an upstate assemblyman changed his vote after they had been counted, allowing the governor's veto to be overriden, New York became the first U.S. state to legalize abortion, three years before <em>Roe v. Wade.</em>
</li><li> Many joke political parties and candidates end up doing this as they become more popular.
<ul><li> Case in point: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">Monster Raving Loony Party</a>, as they would, stood for the Bootle by-election in 1990, and placed higher than the SDP candidate. Screaming Lord Sutch was suitably disturbed by this result, which effectively killed the SDP off. History repeated at the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election in 2019, when the Monster Raving Loonies managed to win more votes than UKIP.
</li><li> The Polish Beer-Lovers' Party managed to win <em>sixteen seats in the Polish Parliament</em>. The result forced them to drop their joke image and become a serious group, the Polish Economic Program — a failure at failing if ever there was one.
</li><li> Possibly the most successful political example of this trope is Jón Gnarr, who ran for mayor of Iceland's capital city Reykjavík in 2010 as head of the satirical "Best Party<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8sceo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8sceo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8sceo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the name was chosen because Iceland advertising laws prevent companies from claiming their products as "the best" due to it being a subjective term, but there's nothing stopping a political party from naming themselves the "Best Party"</span>." Iceland had just gone through a major financial crisis and Jón mostly created the party to satirize establishment politics. To everyone's surprise (including his own), he and his party <em>won the election</em> and he suddenly found himself mayor of a coalition government (after famously vowing not to enter into a coalition with any politician who did not watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, his favourite TV show).
</li><li> In 2002, in the first mayoral election in the town of Hartlepool in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOpNorth">north-east England</a>, Stuart Drummond, better known locally as H'Angus the Monkey, the mascot of the local football team, stood as a joke. In character, as the monkey. He did no real campaigning, he didn't turn up to any hustings or debates, and his only policy was to provide free bananas for schoolchildren. To his astonishment, he won. Once he'd actually become mayor, however, he started taking it seriously, abandoned the monkey persona, and did good enough job to serve three full terms before the town voted to abolish directly-elected mayors. And he did succeed in giving local schoolchildren fresh fruit, albeit not specifically bananas as they were too expensive. He even became a finalist for the World Mayor prize while he was in office.
</li><li> A city in Ecuador was holing a mayoral election with two equally unlikeable candidates. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/ballot/footpowder.asp">Seeing a marketing opportunity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a foot deodorant company decided to put up signs telling people to vote for a can of their foot powder instead of the candidates. The voters <em>elected</em> the can of foot powder.
</li><li> In 1983, restaurant owner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Pungeon Master</a>, and notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll</a> Ivar Haglund, already nicknamed the "mayor" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> waterfront, put his name in the hat for Port Commissioner, a job he actually didn't want; it was merely an extended practical joke on his part. Unfortunately, he got elected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Even more unfortunately, he died of a heart attack the first day he was supposed to clock in for the new job.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> During the 2001 UK Conservative Party leadership election, the first to have the party's MPs thin the candidates down to two in a series of votes before the party membership had their own vote, Kenneth Clarke reportedly knew that he had the support of enough MPs to win the final vote in that stage, and had some of his supporters cast their vote for the unfancied Iain Duncan Smith, in order to avoid facing the much more well-known Michael Portillo, who had just returned to parliament. The strategy initially worked, leaving Clarke to face off against Duncan Smith in the membership vote... and then went catastrophically wrong when former prime minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> publicly endorsed Duncan Smith — adding that she wouldn't have endorsed Clarke or Portillo had they been the final two, as she considered them both too liberal — causing his popularity among the membership to skyrocket and leading to him easily defeating Clarke and becoming leader.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">British Politics</a> has seemingly been full of this recently.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> is thought by many people to have backed Britain's campaign to leave the European Union, not so much because he believed in the cause, but because it would make him more popular with anti-EU Conservative Party members, and therefore more likely to become Prime Minster when David Cameron stepped down.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note941av');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note941av" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note941av');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Britain's parliamentary system the leader of the biggest party is the Prime Minister, and if a Prime Minister resigns in office his or her replacement only has to win an internal election with members of their party, rather than a general election.</span> Meanwhile, goes the theory, he secretly hoped that the campaign, which was a long way behind in the polls, would fail and Britain would stay part of the EU. In the event, however, Boris, who was an immensely popular figure with the public, helped swing the referendum and ultimately ended up dragging Britain out against his own private wishes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">Ashamed of what had happened</a>, he didn't even contest the leadership battle that followed immediately afterwards.
<ul><li> As of the time of writing, Boris' backing of Brexit has turned out <em>even more</em> in his favour: Cameron's successor, Theresa May, made a total hash of the negotiations, had to delay Brexit by seven months to buy more time, then resigned amidst massive public and parliamentary backlash. This time, Boris <em>is</em> contesting the leadership battle, and is the overwhelming favourite to win. All because he backed a course of action he didn't really want.
</li></ul></li><li> Most people believe that David Cameron only offered a referendum in the first place to try and placate some of his more right-wing, traditionalist lawmakers, who fell out with him after he legalised gay marriage - and also to try and win votes from UKIP, a right-wing party offering the same choice. At the time, he calculated, the Conservatives did not look like winning a majority, and he assumed that if he was going to stay as Prime Minister after the next election, he'd have to go back into coalition with the Liberal Democrats (who love the EU as much as anyone in Britain), and could "sacrifice" the offer as part of his party's negotiations. But then the Conservatives won an unexpected majority - largely by taking seats from the Liberal Democrats - and he was forced to go through with his ultimately doomed plan.
</li><li> It's also widely believed that outsider candidate Jeremy Corbyn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">landslide win</a> of the Labour leadership in 2015 is down to Conservative supporters paying a trivial £3 joining fee to vote for him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10txb8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10txb8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10txb8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(more than one Conservative newspaper encouraged their readers to do this)</span>, the intention being that Corbyn, even more politically to the left than Michael Foot, would steer Labour to a colossal election defeat that would bury the Conservatives' main opposition or allow the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to take their place and ensure a right-wing domination of British politics for a generation. If this is true, then all indications point to this backfiring spectacularly for the Conservatives, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Corbyn's Labour managed to make considerable gains in a snap election called by Conservative leader Theresa May two years later and is currently surging ahead in popularity polls</a>. Ultimately subverted though - the tories won a huge landslide in the December 2019 election, winning many seats in the north which have been Labour holds for decades - the 'Red Wall', delivering the worst Labour defeat since Margaret Thatcher was elected.
</li></ul></li><li> In November of 2013, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner attempted to enroll in Healthcare.gov to prove to his constituents that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">the President's</a> much-publicized website was unusable. He was able to enroll successfully in only 45 minutes.
</li><li> In 2012, the Australian Labor Party managed to get Liberal Party member Peter Slipper appointed as the Speaker of the House of Representatives because doing so would effectively neutralise Slipper and increase Labor's "wafer-thin" majority in the House. The Party's motives turned out to be the least of their problems with Slipper... it's best not to go into it here.
</li><li> In 2012, Republican lawmaker Mitch McConnell introduced a bill that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling. It was intended as a bluff to prove that Democrats would vote against it, proving how split they were on the issue. Instead, the Democrats agreed enough to it for a straight up or down vote, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2012/12/06/dem-unity-forces-mcconnell-to-filibuster-his-own-proposal/?utm_term=.a47e2f7a6310">which forced McConnell to filibuster his own bill.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> According to author <a class="urllink" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html">Michael Wolf's insider view<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s 2016 presidential victory is this trope writ large. Trump only ran for president to bolster his brand and springboard new business opportunities; he and his campaign team were expecting to narrowly lose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. Instead, his surprise upset derailed their hopes, with Trump himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">"looking like he'd seen a ghost"</a> when the results were announced. This left the country with a highly unprepared presidential transition team.
<ul><li> Attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act also became this, although similar problems would have likely occurred with any situation in which the Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress, regardless of the President. Under President Obama, the law was very unpopular due to fears that excessive government regulation would cripple the healthcare system, and Congress voted dozens of times to repeal the law, only to be vetoed. Once Trump came into office, however, public opinion turned dramatically in favor of the law, as more attention was placed on how the law reined in greedy practices by insurance companies and that repealing it will allow companies to make it unaffordable. Attempts to repeal it failed repeatedly because many Republicans feared the repeal would deny a large portion of their own base healthcare.
</li></ul></li><li> The inclusion of women as a protected class in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may have been this. Democrat Howard W. Smith added women as a protected class and may have done so to try to sabotage the bill, which he opposed, or as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a> to ensure the Democrats got as much out of women's rights as the Republican's did out of black rights. Whatever his motives, the bill passed with his amendment anyway.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1154mw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1154mw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1154mw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Historians have debated his true motive; some of the people who knew Smith believe that he didn't care about women's rights. Others say that he was working with feminists for years, and that he sincerely supported their cause, though he was openly hostile to this particular bill.</span>
</li><li> The literal version of this trope happened in Germany when in 1933 (albeit about two months before "springtime"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was appointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">chancellor of Germany</a>, the idea being that he would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> to keep him out of trouble and appease his base. President Hindenburg had the real power. However, Hitler knew the loopholes and was able to attain "emergency powers" and eventually become the monstrous dictator we know him as today. After Hindenburg's death in 1934, he combined the powers of president and chancellor and declared himself Führer of Germany.
</li><li> The story behind how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomScott">Mad Cap'n Tom</a> got <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztYapweHD3g">elected as president of the university student's union<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. One of his friend's nominated him as a joke and he decided to go along with it for fun with the intent of losing by a small amount just to irritate the serious candidates. Unfortunately the supporters of the other candidates hated each other more than him and the university used ranked choice voting so he ended up winning the election on second preferences.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder43');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder43" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Draft systems often encourage losing. In a draft, the team with the worst win-loss record gets to pick first, the second-worst team gets the second pick, and so on down the line until it gets to the league champions, who have to pick last. Thus, earlier picks have the most players available to choose from, and giving them the best chance of success next year. So it's often more advantageous for a team with no chance to make the playoffs to keep losing.
<ul><li> The above reason is why the NBA has used a Draft Lottery for teams not making the playoffs since 1985, after some accused the Houston Rockets and other teams of losing intentionally to get the best picks in the '84 draft (one of the most talent-laden in history with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a>, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley). However, even the Draft Lottery itself is controversial as some still believe the '85 lottery was rigged since New York got the top pick with Patrick Ewing as the prize. Today, the teams with the worst records get the best chances of winning the lottery, which leads sportswriters to ridicule bad teams when they <em>don't</em> try to invoke this.
</li><li> Several NBA teams such as the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors were projected to have poor win/loss records for the 2013-14 season, undergoing roster rebuilds with an eye on getting a high pick for the 2014 Draft, which was expected to include several highly regarded prospects. Nobody anticipated the Eastern Conference would exhibit a <em>collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a></em>: as far as a quarter into the season, the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers were the <em>only</em> teams in the East with a winning record. For a time, it was projected that the majority of Eastern Conference playoff spots would be filled by teams with either break-even or losing records. Ultimately, seven of the eight playoff teams finished comfortably over .500, one of those being the aforementioned Raptors (who, you will remember, came into the season expecting to fail miserably). While the Celtics did eventually crash and burn as anticipated, the Raptors (after trading away their supposedly best player to help the team "tank" further) instead ended up topping their division, finished with their best-ever record in team history, and lost out in the first round of the playoffs to the vastly more experienced Brooklyn Nets by just a single point in Game 7.
</li><li> 2011's "Andrew Luck Sweepstakes" in which the worst team in the NFL stood the best chance of using the #1 draft pick to take Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, one of the most NFL-ready quarterbacks in the history of the game. Some fans of perpetually-losing franchises publicly encouraged their team to "Suck for Luck". It's unclear whether any games were thrown by the team that eventually "won", the Indianapolis Colts, who had lost their All-Pro quarterback <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a> for the year before the season even started due to a neck injury and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">legitimately bad as a result</a>. In fact, the only two games the Colts won that year were late in the season (once they replaced their struggling backup QB Curtis Painter with veteran Dan Orlovsky), and legitimately jeopardized their chances of getting the #1 pick.
</li><li> Unlike the Colts above, the Miami Dolphins unquestionably went into the 2019 season tanking for Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. The team cut its roster to the bone and traded most of the best players that remained, eating $66 million in dead cap space<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13oqmg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13oqmg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13oqmg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">I.e. cap space devoted to players no longer on the roster.</span>, and then on top of that traded safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and running back Kenyan Drake after the season started. All of this gained them an empty ledger and three first-round picks in 2020. Their new head coach, Brian Flores, was inexperienced (a single year as defensive coordinator) and a former Patriots assistant, something that has historically not worked out. When the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">got blown out 59-10</a> by the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1, the plan to get Tua seemed to have worked. Unfortunately for Miami, that year's Cincinatti Bengals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">despite actually</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">trying</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">to win, somehow managed to be even</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">worse</a></em>. Combined with some nice performances from Ryan Fitzpatrick and Flores managing to keep the team even vaguely competitive, and the Dolphins lost any chance at the #1 pick. This being said, the Fins did, in fact, draft Tua. However, by that point, Tua had fallen in the draft in favor of Joe Burrow, a Heisman-winning quarterback from LSU, which Cincinnati snapped up first overall.
<ul><li> The Minkah Fitzpatrick trade makes the whole enterprise feel even worse. Pittsburgh was 0-2 at the time and down their star quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, so it looked like it might end up a top-10 or even top-5 pick. Then Fitzpatrick single-handedly turned Pittsburgh's defense from a bunch of underachievers to one of the best defenses in football and knocked the pick down to the late teens.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">And then Tua wrecked his hip and may never be the same player again.</a> Time will tell.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also times where the player would refuse to play for the team that drafted him; two of the most notable cases were John Elway (in 1983) and Eli Manning (in 2004), who refused to play for the Colts and the San Diego Chargers, respectively, and instead were traded to different teams (Elway with the Denver Broncos, Manning with the New York Giants).
<ul><li> Bo Jackson (in 1986) as well. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (led by owner Hugh Culverhouse) hatched their own plot by inviting Bo on a visit to team facilities, and told him it was NCAA-approved. It actually wasn't and ended up causing Bo to miss the remainder of his final college baseball season. The Buccaneers gambled that by forcing Bo out of baseball, he would be forced to choose a professional football career instead. Instead, Bo refused to sign when the Buccaneers drafted him 1st overall, essentially wasting a #1 pick. To make matters worse, Bo Jackson was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 4th round of the 1986 MLB Draft and by the Los Angeles Raiders in the 7th round of the 1987 NFL Draft. (Bo admitted he hated the Buccaneer's not just because he hated Culverhouse, but also because of the Buccaneers' miserable record, AND that they'd also cut their offer in half if he didn't accept a below-market deal.) The end result ruined Culverhouse's reputation in Tampa Bay for good.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This happens in Olympics in Sailing, owing to the scoring system used, as with Ben Ainslie taking Gold in the 2000 Sydney Games. Ainslie led going into the final race knowing that if Brazil's Robert Scheidt finished 22nd or lower, he would win gold. Ainslie thus tacked and tacked upon Scheidt's wind to stall his rival and subsequently push him down the fleet. Ainslie finished 37th, but Scheidt was 22nd, giving Ainslie the gold. Scheidt failed to realize that he needed to accumulate points on his own.
</li><li> The last round-robin group match of the 1998 Tiger Cup soccer tournament was between Thailand and Indonesia. Regardless of the outcome of the game, both were already guaranteed to advance to the semi-finals, but whichever team won that game would face Vietnam while the loser would face Singapore. Both Thailand and Indonesia thought Singapore would be the easier opponent. This led to both teams playing to lose, culminating in Thailand deliberately kicking the ball into their own goal while Indonesia tried to stop them. Ironically, they'd both proceed to lose in the semi-finals, while Singapore would go on to win the whole tournament.
</li><li> In 2008, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in baseball by a game over the Nationals. They wanted to finish last so they could have the #1 pick and draft super prospect Stephen Strasburg. Unfortunately, the usually uber-terrible Yuniesky Betancourt proceeded to have possibly the best two games of his career and led the Mariners to victories in both games, resulting in them losing the top pick.
<ul><li> A similar event happened to the 1968 Philadelphia Eagles. They started 0-11 and were on their way to getting the #1 draft pick, which could have been used to draft Heisman-winning USC running back O.J. Simpson, until they surprisingly defeated the Lions and Saints in consecutive weeks. The Eagles fans did not take their teams' sudden winning streak well; at the final game of the season against the Vikings, the fans threw snowballs at Eagles fan Frank Olivo, who's wearing a Santa Claus costume, in one of the most infamous moments in Philadelphia sports history. The Eagles finished 2-12 and ended up with the third overall pick (due to them losing a coin flip to the Atlanta Falcons, who also finished 2-12), which was used on eventual draft bust Leroy Keyes, while the Buffalo Bills (who finished 1121 that season, and thus, got the #1 pick) would draft Simpson. On a side note, the Eagles passed up "Mean" Joe Greene, who went to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had the fourth overall pick.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, the badminton rounds were changed from a knockout format to a round-robin one which meant that instead of teams being eliminated on the first loss, they could still advance to the next round provided that they didn't lose <em>too</em> much and actually be up against lesser competition than if they had been at the top. Cue an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> match between the Chinese and South Korean teams trying to one-up each other in hilariously poor serves with the Chinese ultimately proving to be better at losing. And then <em>both</em> teams got disqualified for basically making every other badminton player hide their faces in shame, so everybody lost in the end.
</li><li> Algerian sprinter Taoufik Makhloufi was ejected from the 2012 Olympics for not trying in his 800m event (Algeria failed to withdraw him on time, forcing him to compete), instead choosing to save his energy for the 1500m event. Makhloufi was reinstated in time to win gold.
<ul><li> An outcry of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standards</a> were in play as a French sprinter did the same exact thing as Makhloufi but faced zero consequences.
</li></ul></li><li> In baseball leagues without designated hitters, it's accepted that a pitcher might just take a strikeout without even attempting to hit out of fear that actually trying to swing at the ball might result in an injury. This was the case on August 14, 2011 when Giants reliever Santiago Casilla came to the plate for his first career at-bat in eight seasons. He stood as far from the plate as he could, with the bat down. This threw off Marlins pitcher Jose Ceda so badly that he failed to throw a single strike and walked Casilla on four pitches. In other words, a batter who deliberately tried to strike out was awarded first base <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cj6IasJZIk">without doing anything.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A rather tragic example of this was the story of Donald Crowhurst: an electronic engineer and amateur sailor, Crowhurst decided to get publicity for his failing business by entering the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, which gave a trophy and a £5000 prize to whoever was the first and the fastest to sail around the world solo without stopping. Crowhurst had to mortgage his home and his business as collateral for sponsorship from caravan entrepreneur Stanley Best, with the condition that the latter would get his money back if Crowhurst didn't finish the race, meaning if that happened, Crowhurst would lose everything. When the race started, Crowhurst rapidly realized his boat was not ready for the rigors of sailing around the world and he would likely die if he tried, so Crowhurst started dithering around the Atlantic while reporting fake positions on his journey. Despite his meticulousness in doing so, Crowhurst knew that if his logbook was heavily scrutinized he would be exposed, thus he planned to come in last place. However, the occasional error and some misinterpretations from Crowhurst's publicist of the former's messages caused Crowhurst to "become" a serious contender for the speed record, which Crowhurst was forced to go along with. With the trophy already claimed by Robin Knox-Johnston and nearly every other competitor dropping out, Crowhurst hoped to finish behind the last remaining contestant Nigel Tetley, who was rapidly catching up. Unfortunately, Tetley drove himself too hard to "catch up" to Crowhurst and capsized his boat, meaning Crowhurst was sure to win the speed record prize and have his logs rigorously examined. Facing utter ruin, Crowhurst ended up going insane and committed suicide by jumping overboard.

Not to mention the game has now become a main tournament feature at the EVO Championships.

The author, Jason Creighton, signed a contract with the publisher to make the game, but later got into an argument and wanted to cancel the contract. He couldn't, so he decided to make use of one of the clauses, and deliberately create the worst game imaginable so that it would get rejected. It was accepted for publication, despite being literally impossible to play due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>.

Aware that the AI will only choose to steal from whoever is officially in first place, they both try to lose as much money as possible before the AI's turn. Chugga loses eight coins by playing the lottery and losing, then landing on a red space, putting Jon ahead of him. Jon goes to the roulette, bribes the Goomba manning the wheel twenty coins to change the outcome... and <em>wins all those coins back</em>, cementing his "lead" and the AI stealing his star.

One such run got them all the way up to Lance, where they believed that against his final (and strongest) Dragonite, they had no chance, and all their 'Mons were severely hurt. So they sent out the ATV (a Venomoth) just to get killed off. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Red Version</a>'s programming, the ATV poisoned the Dragonite and simply outlasted it because Lance's Dragonite continued to use "Agility" rather than a damaging move (Agility's Psychic-typing is super-effective against Venomoth's Poison type, so the computer continued to pick it due to that "advantage"). The Mob had defeated Lance, despite their resignation. Though they did end up getting shit-stomped by Blue a few moments later. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRematch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRematch">But when they returned</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">things were far different.</a>

Unfortunately, it turned out that the game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">so poorly programmed that the phones still sold out regardless</a>; in only a few years, he owned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> worth 993 quadrillion dollars.

</li><li> Even fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em> who know that the episode "Litter Kills: Literally" is meant to be a harsh satire on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">shows that introduce a new character just to kill them off for the sake of cheap drama</a> have said that it plays JFK's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">brokenness</a> so straight that it goes from the show's typical parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> to an <em>actual</em> VSE about grief.
</li><li> When approached by the producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> to guest-animate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag">Couch Gag</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> wasn't entirely enthusiastic, having been a vocal detractor of the show since its earliest days, and his first instinct was to tell them to go jump off a cliff. However, he was intrigued enough by the creative possibilities of doing a couch gag to tell the producers that he'd make one for them, but only on condition that he would have total creative control, that he would produce it himself with a hand-picked selection of animators, and that the producers could not alter one frame of what he sent them. His past experiences with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> led him to believe that they'd probably turn him down right away, so he naturally ended up surprised when they actually agreed to his conditions.

For example, he <em>actually</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">sold coal to Newcastle</a> at a profit because there just happened to be a miner's strike when he arrived.
</li><li> The City of Pasadena was founded in part by a bankroller who wanted to capitalize on Medical Tourism, which was popular at the time, and short-sell the land, believing it to be a fad vacation spot. Then the railroad came and it is now one of the biggest cities in California.

("The toffee-tastic is a bleak, flavorless, gluten-free wasteland. I'm telling you, it's as flavorless as dirt.") The result? Her sales have skyrocketed, nearly hitting the group's record.
