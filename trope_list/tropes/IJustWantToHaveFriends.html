A probable reason this is so common in fictional media is the fact that a high amount of people consider themselves to have very few or no friends at all.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xznc');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xznc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xznc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15231_7-reasons-21st-century-making-you-miserable.html">some studies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have shown that the majority of people have at most two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">good friends</a> while 1/4 of people dont have anyone they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">trust with a huge secret</a>.</span> As this is not limited to real life however, many fictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">shy people</a> and those with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">few or no friends</a> look for the same fulfillment as the reader, leading to two variants of this trope:
</p><p><strong>Type A</strong>
</p><p>While "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">doing something really cool</a>" is the focus of most fantasies, they also tend to focus on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">friendships</a> the characters have. These fantasies often provide "idealized" friends that the audience presumably doesnt have. While in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> a true friendship needs time and investment, in this kind of fantasy setting often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapistCharacter">the protagonist</a> will obtain tailor-made deep bonds and friendships with little to no time or effort at all.

</p><p><strong>Type B</strong>
</p><p>Sometimes fictional characters do not so easily get friends handed to them with the plot. They are lonely from the start and desperately looking to make and keep friends. The reasons for their loneliness may vary but in the end a character who really wants friends may either try to go about it in the wrong way, make friends with the wrong people, or secretly angst about it behind a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">different facade</a>. If they end up successful more often than not these fictional characters will turn out to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong">sociable all along</a>, especially for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violets</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerds</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">Cool Losers</a> etc.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A common episode plot for situation comedies, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom">domestic comedies</a>: A teenage character seems to have no friends at the moment, has a "woe-is-me" fit and wants to make friends now. After a series of pratfalls, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">the Aesop</a> usually winds up being that friendships are valuable but need to be chosen carefully and that they don't happen overnight.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this trope is defined psychologically as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belongingness">"need to belong."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</p><p>Note that, in the book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourLoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourLoves">The Four Loves</a>, Lewis argues that <em>phileo</em>, Friendship, does not work that way - your friend is someone you have something (activity and/or views) in common with. If you do nothing and have no opinions, you can't have friends in the sense defined by him or her.

<ul><li> Gohan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em>. He spent much of his childhood being home-schooled, and mostly interacted with people his parents knew. In his first day of high school, he got friends very easily and some dates. Granted, this is due to being a handsome, intelligent and kind young man, so it's a given.
</li><li> This is the wish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yugi Mutou</a> made on the Millennium Puzzle.
</li><li> Usagi Tsukino from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> developed her relationships with relative ease due to discovering a shared history through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>. Since multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> are also her reincarnated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroSecretService">Hero Secret Service</a>, she's essentially the center of their social circle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> kicks off with the titular character switching from Type B to Type A. Previously alone and desperate for friends, Iruka's encouragement and Team 7 helps Naruto finally succeed in gaining friends and respect. Often the friendships build slowly, but he is also noted to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">strange power</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">to quickly become friends with anyone</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">even his enemies</a>.
</li><li> This is stated to be Ayumu Nishizawa's original intention in confessing to Hayate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>. It seemed to have evolved into true affection for him by the second time, resolving back to simple friendship later as she realized that Hinagiku really loves him, and the acceptance that both Hinagiku, the rest of the Baka Trio and Nagi have accepted her and she no longer needs to fear being left behind by him.
<ul><li> In opposition to the style of the trope type, it did appear that there is lots of work and effort being put into building and strengthening these friendships, since she's not the main character, it's not been focused on though.
</li></ul></li><li> The main motivation for Nano, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou">Nichijou</a></em>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">want to be normal</a> is this.
</li><li> Miho of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> is this in the prequel manga, <em>Little Army</em>, which reveals that her friends, Emi, Chihiro and Hitomi, are the only people she's known with any real interest in tanks, which is why she tries so hard to keep the group together.
</li><li> Itou and Saito of the Shinsengumi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> both wanted friends. Itou suffered years of resentment and jealousy of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a> to his ill brother and desperately wishes for acknowledgement, believing that overthrowing Kondou would be the best way, not realizing that the Shinsengumi already treated him as a friend. Saito was too shy to speak to others and his stoic silence misled others and drove them to paranoia and fear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Unico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Unico">Unico</a></em> is full of this. Unico himself is constantly put into new places where he tries to make friends, just to be forced to abandon and forget them later. Most of the people he meets are also this, either by being awkward or even literally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>. Since Unico is a series full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> and with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, it's needless to say that both Unico and a lot of the people he befriends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">end up all alone in the end</a>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Nightwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Nightwalker">Nightwalker</a></em> centers on a friendless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> schoolgirl who stumbles across a good-luck charm inhabited by a "guardian angel". Suddenly she leads a charmed life and is the center of attention, and she refuses to give it up even after learning that her "angel" is draining her life-force.
</li><li> The entire reason that Kanna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> wanted to go to school was out of a desire to have friends. All of her classmates (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">especially</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Saikawa</a>) love her pretty much from the word go, due to a combination of her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormalFishInATinyPond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NormalFishInATinyPond">good at everything</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">absolutely adorable</a>.
</li><li> Shin-ah from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn">Yona of the Dawn</a></em> grew up painfully lonely, shunned by his village and left completely alone after the one person who sort of looked out for him died when he was very young.

</li><li> It is suggested by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em> that Mark Zuckerberg (the character as well as the real-life person) falls into this category, and is hardly subtle in demonstrating the irony of a man (or man-boy) creating a revolutionary tool for connecting friends and in the process driving away his own.

After being forced to leave his home world and losing the closest thing he has to a mom as a kid, poor Sonic spends a whole decade in a cave with nothing but himself to keep him company. He pretends to have conversations and activities by using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, and also pretends to have friends by spying on the residents of Green Hills; he even acknowledges at one point that his loneliness has driven him a "bit crazy". Sonic finally hits his breaking point while playing a baseball game by himself; he scores a home run, cheers for himself, and looks over at the stands to see them completely empty. The resulting frustration and sorrow Sonic feels is what leads him to trigger the EMP that knocks out power across half the country.

<ul><li> The King in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittlePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittlePrince">The Little Prince</a></em> is implied to be this. Note how desperately he tries to get the Little Prince to stay.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Remus Lupin comes off a bit like this. There are more than a few instances where he goes against his own better judgement because he really likes to have people like him, partly due to his ostracism over being a werewolf.
</li><li> Luna Lovegood painted the main gang as her friends on her bedroom ceiling. This demonstrates how lonely she must have been before meeting them, considering her and the gang weren't particularly close. By the time she painted Harry &amp; Co., it's arguable that she actually was that close to at least some of them. She often supports Harry when no one else will, and she seems to spend a lot of time with Ginny. The evidence placing her in this trope comes sooner than this, in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> when she says of the DA meetings, "It was like having friends".
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Snape hung out with the Death Eater Jr. gang and went on to join Voldemort with them partly because of this trope.
<ul><li> As noted below, this is an accurate representation of how cults and terrorist organizations recruit.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, similar to Snape, Quirinus Quirrell went in search of Voldemort (maybe to defeat him in his weakened state) because people constantly laughed at him and teased him so he wanted to do something amazing to show them up.
</li><li> Likewise, Ginny and Hermione started off this way. Ginny was very shy and meek and didn't have many friends, and the guy she had a crush on was way out of her league (she thinks). Hermione was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> for two solid months, before she chilled out and became friends with Harry and Ron. because of her status as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, nobody wanted to be her friend, nobody liked her much.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StillLifeWithCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StillLifeWithCrows">Still Life with Crows</a></em>, the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>, hideously deformed from a broken back when he was little, monstrously strong thanks to a lifetime spent climbing a cave network. Since his only contact with the outside world was with his mother, all he wanted are some friends — even if that included "playing" with them with lethal results.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>. Jane is so desperate for love and affection that she tells Helen Burns she'd happily let herself be kicked in the chest by a horse if it meant Helen and the Headmistress would care for her. Helen then shushes Jane and tells her to put more faith in God than in human companions.
</li><li> Another Charlotte Brontë example: Lucy Snowe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Villette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Villette">Villette</a> is overjoyed to be spending so much time with Dr. John despite the fact that he is a pretty big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> to her because she has felt so alone all her life.
</li><li> In keeping with the Brontë sisters, there are some hints at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em> that Heathcliff has this attitude towards Mr. Lockwood. While his attitude towards the latter can hardly be described as pleasant and charming, the opening of the book takes place towards the end of Heathcliff's life (much of the story is recounting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a>), and his inept attempts at providing hospitality towards Lockwood offer some suggestions that, after living a life of hatred, bitterness and spite, he is trying to form some kind of connection after finally meeting someone who knows nothing of his past and doesn't hate him on sight (or vice versa).
</li><li> The main four characters of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a> series, although three of them would probably hate to admit it. They all come from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">Friendless Background</a>. Sandry is very cheerful and friendly, but her family constantly travelling made it difficult to form permanent relationships. Then almost all of her family was killed in a plague. Daja also probably had friends on her trader ship, but then everyone died in a storm and she was made an outcast from her society for being bad luck. Tris is naturally cranky and a jerk, and magical powers which made her seem like a possessed demon didn't help her. Finally, Briar Moss was a street rat who didn't seem to have very close friends. When they're all forced into a house together they do <em>not</em> get along very well, and only Sandry tries tries to make peace. Eventually through months of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. (Although, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sandry magically tying their magic together so they became psychically linked probably helped, too.</span>)
</li><li> The chief motivation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer">sapient supercomputer</a> Mike in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em>. All he wants are some more "not-stupids" to talk to — and he participates in the Loonie rebellion purely out of loyalty to the few friends he does have.
</li><li> Hector, protagonist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebSerialNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebSerialNovel">Web Serial Novel</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheZombieKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheZombieKnight">The Zombie Knight</a></em>. Combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">crippling shyness</a>, it has caused him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">considerable difficulty</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> culminating in his suicide prior to the start of the story</span>.
</li><li> Rachel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em> wants to have friends, but her superpowers have overwritten her social instincts with canine ones and she tends to brutalize anyone who gets near her as a reflexive defense mechanism due to spending years on the run. It isn't until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Taylor</a>, who is similarly friendless, comes along that Rachel actually gets a friend, because Taylor actually buts in the effort to get to know her and refuses to back down.
</li><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictoriaForester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictoriaForester">Victoria Forester</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoCouldFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoCouldFly">The Girl Who Could Fly</a></em>, Piper's dream at the Fourth of July picnic. A brief moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection">Commonality Connection</a> is broken by her previous isolation and the stories that are told about her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FindingSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FindingSnowflakes">Finding Snowflakes</a></em> has this as one of the main goals for the main character, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero">Socially Awkward Hero</a> who is avoided due to his bad reputation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a>. Actually a deconstruction; unlike many examples of this trope, said main character doesn't just automatically get friends, as he would wish. Nobody welcomes him into a group they have already established, obviously, and it is not likely a person will welcome someone with bad credentials just because of a kind act. Poor Eliott is algo to blame since his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> status make it exceptionally difficult to actually <em>interact</em> with people, and when he does, it isn't always nice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindOnFire">Wind on Fire</a>:</em> Mumpo spends much of the first book, The Wind Singer, friendless and shunned by both his peers and the rest of society. He wants desperately to have friends and becomes infatuated with Kestrel simply because she speaks to him. Even when she is outright hostile to him he clings to the hope of friendship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MayBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MayBird">May Bird</a></em> has a dark example with the villain of the story, Bo Cleevil. A being of darkness, he consistently confides in the protagonist that he feels empty and that he plans to conquer Earth and the Ever After so that he'll never feel lonely again. Unfortunately, he'll always be empty because his idea of gaining friends is enslaving all the good people and becoming a celebrity among the bad.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMachineriesOfEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMachineriesOfEmpire">The Machineries of Empire</a></em>, the reason Cheris joined the Kel was that she wanted to belong in a group and the military, with its conformism and formation instinct, fits this need perfectly.
</li><li> Kalin Taylor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectTau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectTau">Project Tau</a></em> feels this way at the beginning, which leads him to approach the college fraternity despite it being fairly obvious that he's not the type of member they're looking for.

Not until he's well into his twenties does he meet Bayta, who has genuine affection for him. He's so overwhelmed by the feeling of just being liked that he inadvertently, carelessly, lets her ruin his plans for conquering the Second Foundation.

Starting at boarding school, she outright states that what she really wants is to make a best friend. She is very upset when, for a while, she thinks that unpopular dork Molly only befriended her because Alice's father is her favourite author. Once she joins the titular Poison Apples, though, she quickly grows into best friends with the other two members.

(Most of the friends she had in junior high, as it turned out, lived in another high school district.) She ends up nearly joining a group called the Boosters, purportedly a pep club to support the class leaders and athletes but in reality a group that adheres to strict social codes and a closed group of friends, but after an accident involving Peter's volcano, she finally realizes her values aren't the same as those of the Booster club members.

<ul><li> The Doctor has elements of this trope. Hundreds of years old, a genius, the last of his race  all of this makes him very isolated. Even when he does get friends, it's inevitable that he'll lose them eventually, either from old age, death, alternate dimensions, mind-wiping or just moving on with their lives or falling in love. The fact that he was shown to plead with his <em>arch-nemesis</em> not to leave him probably shows just how lonely the Doctor really is.
</li><li> Said arch-nemesis shares this longing. The Doctor and the Master were once the greatest of friends, but something drove them apart (likely the Master's mounting insanity). The Master spends most of the Twelfth Doctor's tenure executing a plan that spans the entirety of human history in order to give the Doctor a birthday present and bring them back together.

Pining to be one of the popular girls, she falls in with a group of snobbish rich girls that seem to be the most popular. Instead of being "cool" they prove to be a bad influence on Jennifer, as she skips school, stays out past curfew and begins disrespecting her parents. It's only when her friends try to host a beer party at the Keatons, and they also press their luck by trying to make her spurn her friend, that these aren't the friends she wants to have, and is best off with that nerdy, unspectacular friend. (And truth be told, the "cool" girls likely weren't that popular at all, and that Alex's hinted-at advice — be yourself — is advice well taken.)

</li><li> It's shown a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> that the titular character doesn't really enjoy traveling alone and sometimes craves companionship. Unfortunately, Aku exploits this by pretending to be a woman named "Ikra" in one episode. Aku exploits it again in the comics, by pretending to be a woman named Jill simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. Thankfully, he does make friends with the Scotsman. This is even shown in season 5 when he attempts to save &amp; befriend a Pre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> Ashi, despite the latter hating his guts.
</li><li> Mitchell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> acts like a haughty jerk to the main characters most of the time, but it was revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> "Holidays in Boxwood Terrace" that he's really a lonely kid who wants to have friends, but he didn't know how to go about it yet. At the end of the episode, Jet, Sydney, Mindy, Sean, and Sunspot accepted him into their clique for good.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood"> Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a></em>, Daniel Tiger has a fairly large circle of friends. Even so, his main concern regarding the new neighbors early in <em>The Daniel Tiger Movie: Won't You Be Our Neighbor?</em> as expressed in song is "<em>Will our new neighbors have a friend for me?</em>"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zoey joined the show for this very reason. She grew up in a small town and considered herself an outcast amongst the jocks in her home town.
</li><li> Beardo reveals in his audition tape that he wanted to be on the show to make friends. Unfortunately, considering that he was the first contestant eliminated after annoying all of his teammates, this didn't work.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Often invoked when youths enter junior high/middle school. What seemed like rock-solid friendships in elementary school often change by the time they turn 11 and 12 years old, and while some friendships remain, this is often the time when interests change and kids begin to mature in many ways. Some get left behind, but even those who don't will sometimes have periods of time when they have few to no close friends ... and it isn't necessarily a bad thing, as within a short time period they make new friends and ones that become more firmly established. This can happen again by the time these same students enter college — changed friends lists, sometimes wholesale as they move to different communities (sometimes miles from home) and begin losing contact with the classmates they had in high school and earlier (and old friends begin new lives of their own) ... and sometimes, it takes a little while to figure out who those new friends will be. The process continues to repeat after college, as these now-young adults begin establishing their new personal, family and professional lives ... sometimes in new communities where beginning to establish new friendships is not an overnight process.
</li><li> This trope is how people get sucked into gangs, cults and even terrorist groups. They don't let you in on the really crazy stuff until your entire social circle is comprised of other members. At that point, walking away means abandoning all of your friends. Also, although not necessarily how they suck you in, some people do cite this as a reason for why they're reluctant to leave a more standard church. For many people, the people in their church comprise a large social circle of their friends.
</li><li> Similarly, people will stay in bad or even abusive relationships because they're afraid to go back to being single.
<ul><li> Sometimes people get into relationships while having no friends. If they leave their partner, they leave their one friend. They become trapped in the relationship, regardless of its health.
</li></ul></li><li> This is sometimes what coaxes people into joining the military. Depending on what unit they end up with, this can either end well or badly.
</li><li> The first reaction of King Gustaf III of Sweden, upon learning that he had inherited the throne, was supposedly to say, "How sad. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">Now I will never have friends.</a>"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourLoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourLoves">The Four Loves</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> asserts that this approach is bound to fail because people whose only goal is friendship have no basis for the kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection">Commonality Connection</a> that leads to authentic friendship:
<div class="indent">The very condition of having Friends is that we should want something else besides Friends. Where the truthful answer to the question <em>Do you see the same truth?</em> would be "I see nothing and I don't care about the truth; I only want a Friend", no Friendship can arise<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourLoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourLoves">though Affection of course may</a>. There would be nothing for the Friendship to be <em>about</em>; and Friendship must be about something, even if it were only an enthusiasm for dominoes or white mice. Those who have nothing can share nothing; those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travellers.
</div></li><li> People in toxic fandoms / fanbases / fan communities for relatively niche topics or works tend to stick around anyway, because once they leave that community the number of people who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection">share their interest</a> likely drops to (near-)zero.
