However, despite being set several decades, or even centuries or millennia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, the remains of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeforetimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeforetimes">the pre-cataclysm society</a> are still in remarkably preserved condition. Buildings and objects may have a lot of dust and dirt on them, but they haven't fallen apart due to neglect. Furthermore, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">pre-cataclysm devices or vehicles</a> that the characters find will work just fine.

</p><p>This trope can be justified, in small doses, since there is an expensive way to render any metal rust-proof the same way that platinum is  one could assume that these relics have survived because of a similar process and the chemicals used in it are breaking down, allowing the relics to decay in places where the treatment faded first. This trope is also justified when dealing with advanced alien technology, as such technology may not necessarily decay as the same rate as modern Earth technology.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>:
<ul><li> Downplayed with locations like the Ryugu Shelter or a nearby subway station. The former looks aged, but still has working electricity and speakers and is treated as decently sturdy. On the other hand, the smallest of errors can easily cause the entire structure to fall apart. And the latter's train looks pristine, but is so badly corroded and affected by prolonged contact with seawater that it crumbles like papermaché at the slightest touch.
</li><li> Justified with the Fuji shelters and ship. They were purposefully designed to persevere for unknown times, so that the members of the 7 Seeds Project could make use of the supplies inside of them whenever they awoke. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Downplayed with the Fuji ship. It overall still works perfectly, just not the parts where iron-eating bacteria has affected the machines.</span>
</li><li> Played with a hotel early on. The furniture is aged, rotted through and in no good condition. The organ still functions fine, beyond some minor tuning required.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight and subverted in the Sankei Newspaper <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> serial. When he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">travels back in time</a> to the era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> he eventually shuts down due to the fuel he runs on not having been invented yet. He winds up at the bottom of the Mekong river and isn't found for decades, but a quick refill has him up and about again with no difficulty (though he was in a box at the time). When he runs out of fuel a second time due to its prohibitive cost, though, he falls down on a mountain and by the time his "birth" comes around again he is nothing more than a rusted-out shell.
</li><li> The eponymous mecha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion">Cannon God Exaxxion</a></em> lay buried on Earth for over 2000 years before being excavated by the hero's father. Perhaps justified, in that it was kept in a giant space-packing crate and the mech itself is practically indestructible.
</li><li> Both played straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>. While Mobile Suits sealed in special "Mountain Cycle" chambers work more-or-less perfectly due to maintenance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">Nanomachines</a>, other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> isn't so lucky. The titular Gundam's beam rifle it was uncovered with is degraded enough to burn itself out with one shot, and when Loran finds an armory, nearly every weapon crumbles to dust when he tries to pick it up, aside from the Hyper Hammer and that one breaks after being used only once.
<ul><li> Another reason why there aren't any other relics from the "Dark History" is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Moonlight Butterfly <em>destroyed everything else</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, the Gundam Barbatos is in perfect working condition even after not seeing combat for over 300 years. Subverted for other Gundam Frames — out of the 72, only 26 actually survived to the present day.
</li><li> Played partially straight (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em>, when the missing ChoRyuJin is dug up after sixty-five million years, his body is completely fossilized, but his AIs are found to still be in working order. It turns out, however, that he had some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> they were using specifically to keep himself alive long enough to be found again.
</li><li> The manga one-shot <em>Hotel</em> is a deliberate case. The main character is a robotically controlled, self-repairing structure designed to preserve the genetic data of Earth's creatures for billions of years after global warming has destroyed everything.
<ul><li> And when you consider the fact that the AI is not only increasingly self-aware but had managed to keep itself functioning for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>27 million years</em></span>, even as all its systems break down, it could also be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>.
</li><li> The Noah Ark from the same manga is another example: an intelligent colony ship designed to carry all human knowledge as well as 140,000 samples of human DNA. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the time Noah reached its destination however, the DNA strands were lost, resulting in its evolved AI returning to Earth in the hopes of accessing the Hotel.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A significant plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingOfThorn">King of Thorn</a></em>, when the characters are trying to figure out how far in the future they are after waking up from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">suspended animation</a>. The massive jungle of thorns that has overgrown the island indicates that thousands of years have passed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until one character notices that the lights are still on and none of the bulbs have burned out...</span>
</li><li> In the penultimate scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">End of Evangelion</a></em>, this trope is mentioned as the true reason why the Evas were created: a monument that will outlast the universe itself.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yui:</strong> Humans can only exist on this Earth, but the Evangelion will be able to exist forever, along with the human soul that dwells within it. When the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are all gone, Eva will exist so long as just one person remains. It will be lonely, but as long as one person still lives-
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong> It will be eternal proof that mankind ever existed.
</div></li><li> Humorously averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>. In her first appearance, Martina reactivates a war golem made by her ancestors during the last great Mazoku War, which took place 1,500 years previous. As she gloats over its immense power, the golem starts malfunctioning, due to the fact that its 1,500 years old and hasn't been maintained in at least 1,000.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> by the Poneglyphs, much to the chagrin of the World Government. The Poneglyphs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">indestructible</a> records of the true history of the world that the government wants to suppress. Since they can't destroy the Poneglyphs they settle for silencing anyone capable of reading them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as Nico Robin and Gold Roger.</span>
</li><li> The Protoculture of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> may have disappeared almost 500,000 years ago, but many of their creations are still in good working order. Here's the known examples divided by series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> has a Zentraedi mothership that is still in perfect working order, and a factory satellite that <em>is</em> breaking down... but only because of continuous attacks on it during the last half million years. The latter can still be repaired, and there are other satellites which, having suffered far fewer attacks, are in much better conditions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Macross: Do You Remember Love?</a></em> has the ruins of a Protoculture city with many of its technologies, including the antigravity systems, still working until the Meltrandi target the ruins with multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">heavy converging beam cannons</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em> has the Bird Human, a bird-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that, once activated and set to bomb humanity back into stone age, proves more than a match for dozens of sea-faring warships and attached planes, only suffering damage when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption">the UN fires four reaction weapons at it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> had an episode where Alto was attacked by a Vajra during a training exercise in an ancient battlefield. Since his Valkyrie was only equipped with "dummy" weapons at the time, he grabs a Zentradi beam weapon that's been drifting in space for seven thousand years and uses it to slay the Vajra.

Chito and Yuuri wander through in a massive, crumbling city with multiple levels large enough to each support their own countless skyscrapers. Although centuries have passed and humans are nearly extinct, the city is still mostly holding together and a number of its systems still function fine, such as plumbing, lighting, and machinery used to mass-produce food. The girls even encounter functioning robots carrying out their original duties, an automated train, a derelict mecha with operational WMD's, and an AI that runs an elevator between two of the levels. In particular, the AI explains that since it can't terminate itself without human authorization, it would keep running until the city's "reserve power's reserve power's reserve power's reserve power" runs out.

<ul><li> The world that's been abandoned for 700 years is filled with rust and falling apart. The eponymous robot has only survived for so long by scavenging parts from other robots as they break down. However, even after 700 years, and all the believable wear and tear, there are a great many buildings still standing, ships operate enough to use their magnet, buildings are mostly intact, electronic billboards operate enough to give exposition, and most of the random gadgets that Wall-E finds are in perfect working condition, including an old VCR and VHS (maybe not perfect, but far better off than they should be after 700 years). Perhaps other robots programmed for repair are still going.
</li><li> The <em>Axiom</em> even more so. Keep in mind that the starship is over <em>700 years</em> old by the time the movie takes place.

Probably helped that in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Buy N Large's</a> "built-to-last" mentality, there's a network of robots and automated systems constantly maintaining the ship and even robots to repair other robots.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth">Battlefield Earth</a></em> is one of the worst offenders. The Earth has been taken over by aliens for a thousand years, and the characters escape into the ruins of Denver, Colorado. Not only are all of the buildings still standing, but books are still readable, computers still work, and military jets that should have crumbled into dust centuries ago are completely operational. And they have perfectly working jet fuel, which has a shelf life of 40 years. And as if that weren't bad enough, the characters even encounter an abandoned shopping mall where frozen chickens can still be found in the supermarkets. This is a major divergence from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattlefieldEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattlefieldEarth">the book</a>, wherein civilization was pretty much completely gone, buildings crumbling, machines rusted to junk, books decayed to the point of falling apart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waterworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waterworld">Waterworld</a></em> is another major offender.

Despite this, <strike> anyone</strike> the Mariner can just swim down to a former city and come back up with perfectly working artifacts. The "smokers" have completely operational jet skis and sea planes, and even large stashes of cigarettes, which have a shelf life of a few weeks.

Averted completely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTimeMachine1960" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTimeMachine1960">the 1960 version</a>. When the protagonist arrives in the future, he finds practically all traces of his own time gone entirely- the remnants of his time consist of a collection of books that crumble into dust as soon as he touches them. The only other remnants of any previous society are "talking rings" (presumably an advanced recording device from a future society, possibly intended as a time capsule or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a> in which case its preservation is somewhat understandable)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parallels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parallels">Parallels</a></em> has Polly insisting that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the building is always the same, in every universe - including one where a suitcase nuke was detonated across the street. In that Earth, the building is apparently immune to rust, decay, moss, weather - unlike everything else nearby, which has clearly been through hell.</span> Arguably justified, since apparently the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Core World</span> clearly has a lot invested in the thing. That said, the builders definitely could have sprung for a cleaning service on the <em>inside.</em>
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em> had a space station shot through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> of the especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsMagic">Magical</a> variety. It wound up being abandoned for centuries, on an Earthlike planet's surface, with zero maintenance, and the computer and thrusters still worked immediately upon being activated. Although the main character specifically mentions it was designed to last forever, making this an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a>.
</li><li> The main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday">Doomsday</a></em> finds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Bentley</a> that's been in a storage locker for twenty-seven years. It's in perfect condition with a full tank of petrol, and she has no problem using it to stage a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em>-style chase with the bad guys. This may be justifiable (after all, it had been locked away in a sealed underground bunker), but what can't be explained is how the denizens of post-apocalyptic Scotland have somehow managed to keep their own cars running for twenty-seven years, despite there being no oil on the Scottish mainland (it all comes from the North Sea).
<ul><li> To be fair, when they're unearthing the Bentley we do see them manhandling some fuel drums, so it's possible it was fueled from these, although this isn't explicitly shown.
</li><li> Scotland also has some pretty huge refineries and storage depots for processing of North Sea oil. As civilisation collapsed in a matter of weeks, it's conceivable that there would be enough salvageable fuel to run a limited amount of vehicles.
</li></ul></li><li> Played completely straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em>, where the city has been running completely without maintenance for at least 200 years. The main characters wander through several rooms of massive machinery which is merrily pumping away with no one looking after it. And this doesn't even get into the problems of how food was imported into the city and waste was exported from it.
<ul><li> Possibly Justified and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> (at least in the novel) in that the city was specifically designed to function on its own for practically forever; with maintenance systems, food processing systems, and so on that operate out of sight of the residents (some of which are encountered by Logan and other Runners).
</li></ul></li><li> Short-term variant: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheComet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheComet">Night of the Comet</a></em>, despite the death-by-disintegration of nearly everyone on the planet, everything automated in Los Angeles — lawn sprinklers, pre-recorded radio broadcasts, traffic lights — keep right on activating on schedule, well after power outages should've resulted with no one to oversee city utilities.
</li><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend">I Am Legend</a></em>, which is set in New York City three years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>. Despite the relatively short timeframe, there are already signs of decay in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly</span> empty metropolis: tunnels are flooded, plants are starting to grow in the streets, and outside of the protagonist's home, near everything has a hint of dust and grime. Which is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. New York City spends thousands of dollars a year on pumps to keep water out of the tunnels. And anyone in the city can tell you how much damage grass does to sidewalks.

But when Clark finds it all systems seem to be in working order.

The colony ship <em>Elysium</em> was intentionally built to last the multiple-century flight to another star-system using minimal maintenance staff on rotating rounds of cryogenic sleep. It was also to arrive intact enough to likely serve as the base foundation for the new colony. The inversion and catalyst for the main plot is that the ship's engine and power core is breaking down far faster than it should. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only it turns out to not be an inversion; during the climactic confrontation the protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">are shown</a> that they've already arrived at their destination planet, and in fact crashed or set down and are at the bottom of the ocean. Exact numbers are sketchy or non-existent, but they estimate it must have been there several times longer than the ship was ever designed to remain operational, meaning it's likely lasted several thousand years.</span>

Although Doc Brown took some measures to ensure that the DeLorean would not suffer too much deterioration by storing it in a dry, dark cave for seventy years, it still needed to be restored to working condition: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">the time travel circuitry had to be changed out with vacuum tubes</a>, while the original tires needed to be replaced with whitewall tires.

In the 1980s, the pyramid is discovered and it's still functional; channeling the energy of the sun revives Apocalypse.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>, wherein Zack and Gray stumble across the old visitor's center and administrative buildings of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>.

The city of Diaspar was shielded and designed to be self-maintaining and to survive indefinitely long. It's a billion years old. The all-pervading computer system that runs the city creates clones of people, imbuing them with recorded knowledge and memories of their previous life. This is contrasted against the world outside Diaspar, which has decayed completely into desert; with the exception of the city of Lys, which is shielded by artificial mountains and maintained by the advanced abilities of its residents. The novel states that Diaspar is maintained by triple-redundant memory storage combined with matter converters.

Even having been put in storage specifically to last a long time (and survive a volcanic eruption), many computer and vehicle parts are little more than scrap, and some fuel has had its seals fail and gone bad.

But Battle Fleet ships that were put on standby properly can be quickly restored (within weeks for planetoids). "Mother" and its orbital fortresses are fully functional, again thanks to a one-of-a-kind AI. Although nuclear/antimatter/warp warheads that weren't stored properly went off in the interim.

Further, when humans start traveling through the Rings they find well-preserved ruins and machinery on the first planet they settle on. Averted when the machinery starts (trying) to power up when it detects the presence of the humans, and it becomes clear that a billion years without maintenance takes a toll on functionality.

</li><li> At least in the case of the Elder Things, their city may have been <em>founded</em> billions of years ago, but it was only ultimately abandoned a mere 500,000 years in the past, which is certainly enough time for a solid stone structure to survive in favourable conditions.

<ul><li> Not necessarily an example, due to the utilisation of nano-scale technology- it could just be the case that the space-craft etc themselves are infused with a nanotech 'housekeeping' contingent that constantly repairs them.

When Eretria wonders why it hasn't rotted into dust, Amberle explains that many such structures were buried when the age of man came to an end, keeping them sealed off from the elements.

However, there are a few times when it gets bizarre.
<ul><li> In "Moebius", Daniel takes what appears to be a small commercial camcorder on a time-travel 5000 years into the past. When the team screws up the timeline, he leaves the camcorder in a buried Goa'uld jar to be unearthed in the 21st Century. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> SG-1 watches the tape with little difficulty (Hammond says only that the battery needed to be recharged) and take the camera with them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, then leave it buried <strong>again</strong> for the back-to-normal SG-1 to find, meaning this simple piece of home electronics has made a 10,000 year round-trip journey! These jars are made to last.
<ul><li> Arguably justified, as those Goa'uld jars are actually stasis devices designed to "store" rebellious Goa'uld symbiotes.
</li></ul></li><li> In the spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Atlantis has been abandoned for 10,000 years at the bottom of the sea with a shield covering it, but most of the things inside are in working order or at least intact, down to the dead plants. We do see several sections of the city that protruded outside the shield and were worse for wear, however, and in one episode we see a "sister city" of Atlantis that was left on a planet's surface without the protection of a shield. It's so overrun with vegetation and general decay that only the central tower is even recognizable. The city's weapon system is still functional, however.
<ul><li> A later episode of <em>Atlantis</em> did reveal that the city's survival to the present was the result of an altered timeline: when the "original" SG team came through from Earth, they found a ruined city whose shield AI had incrementally sacrificed everything but the control tower to the crushing depths over the centuries in an attempt to conserve power  power which the SG team drained completely by rocking up and turning on the lights. The only team member to survive the subsequent destruction of the city did so thanks to time-travelling to the weeks before the city was abandoned by its original inhabitants... then took the long way back, popping in and out of a stasis pod every few centuries to cycle the shield's drain on the power supply  so more of a Ragnarok-inoculation than proofing, in the end...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> the Ancient exploration ship <em>Destiny</em> was launched on an unmanned voyage long before Atlantis left Earth, perhaps more than a million years ago. When the protagonists arrive it's still travelling but is very much the worse for wear - the majority of its interior is sealed off to contain various hull breaches, its life support system is no longer able to extract carbon dioxide from the air (the filters are quite realistically choked with toxic black muck), and even the lights are dim or failing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> pulled this off a few times.

Yes, the life support system, lights, power generator etc. have been in use constantly for 1000 years with no maintenance and not only have not completely broken down but are in good enough condition that the <em>Enterprise</em> crew feels safe beaming over with no spacesuits. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by Picard remarking that the ship was built "for the generations" and it worked.

Which was programmed using a steel file. Not only was the head still working, it was returned to service and seems none the worse for its advanced age, throughout the remainder of the series and movies!

</li><li> In the TNG episode "Contagion", they come across a perfectly functioning pan-galactic teleporter, which was built over 200,000 years ago... and the planet it was found on was an uninhabitable wasteland... which was made that way via orbital bombardment, around the same time.

And they still work. Often times better than the new stuff. Many fans believe some of the absurdly heavy tonnages and large size of various electronic equipment and weapons is specifically <em>because</em> they're built to last.
<ul><li> Also, presumably if you're planning to pass a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> off to you kids, you're going to keep it maintained.

Unmaintained and poorly maintained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a> technology tends to fail miserably when pushed into combat.

While 'Mechs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ships</a> are very close to being lost technology by the late Succession Wars (and interstellar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Jump Ships</a> basically are), the knowledge to maintain them remains... which makes sense, since people without degrees in metallurgy, chemistry, or engineering commonly maintain things like guns and tanks and reactors. All those old 'Mechs are (usually) still maintained. On the other hand, the Terran Hegemony/Star League was so over-the-top in Ragnarok-proofing that SLDF Brian Caches, facilities, and even the occasional interstellar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarShip">War Ship</a> (and their contents) can be rediscovered and reactivated after being abandoned for a quarter of a millennium.

However, ever so often, a cache of military equipment from the previous age, specifically stated to be Ragnarok-Proofed, is found.
<ul><li> The fact that certain Golden Age structures and technology were built using "mega-damage" materials that were far superior to presently existing real world materials helps considerably. Even so, most surface structures from pre-Rifts times have been reduced to ruins, with surviving locations often being underground military-industrial installations designed to withstand a global war.
</li><li> This has been partially subverted recently, as it's been revealed that many of those caches are much more recent, and were deliberately left for people to find.
</li><li> <em>Dinosaur Swamp</em> has a table for finding old nuclear missile silos in what's left of Cape Canaveral, with the results essentially telling <em>how</em> well that silo was Ragnarok-Proofed.

The Castle was abandoned, the robots were left to fend for themselves in the ruins (one of them even fell from the sky and crashed near a waterfall) and the Airship was buried in a desert, and yet everything is in perfect working order by the time the Light Warriors need to use it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> is a serial offender:
<ul><li> The Gardens were built by the Centra, an ancient civilization that was obliterated during the last Lunar Cry some 80 years prior. Though derelict by the time they're turned into SeeD schools, the technology that transforms them into flying, mobile stations works perfectly fine.
</li><li> The Ruins of Centra qualify as well, with functioning elevators and other technology still in place after 80 years  worse still, while the Gardens were in other places of the world, said ruins lie in the area affected by the Lunar Cry. It might be partly justified, along with the aforementioned Gardens, as it's implied that Centran technology is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>, maybe both combined.
</li><li> There's also the appropriately named, fueled and functioning Ragnarok, which spent seventeen years drifting in space. In the Ragnarok's case, it makes some sense (space being a fairly safe environment for preservation) as the ship appeared to be in low-power mode and not using any oxygen thanks to the alien things running loose on the ship that didn't require it.
</li><li> Even more impressive is the Lunatic Pandora, a massive, mountain-sized craft that was buried in the ocean for the better part of two decades but remained fully functional when it was recovered. Those Estharian engineers <em>really</em> know their craft.
</li><li> And then there's the Deep Sea Research Center, a huge artificial island built upon the ruins of some ancient civilisation (predating Centra) that could give Lunatic Pandora a run for its money. The facility has been abandoned for an undisclosed amount of time to the point its entrance and top layer is completely overgrown with vegetation and in severe disrepair, yet the bottom layers, all consisting of huge glass walls isolating the ruins from the surrounding ocean, seem fine. There's not a single leak or broken glass in the massive cylindrical structure, and the machinery inside still operates and has enough steam power not only to allow the party to reach its bottom, but to launch excavations. All of this despite utter lack of mantainance in such a harsh environment as deep ocean.

Case in point: Cid's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">airship</a>, the Fahrenheit, was found <em>embedded in rock, underwater</em>, a thousand years after the fall of civilization. Not only is its interior in perfect condition (as Tidus and Rikku verify when they first salvage it), its weaponry is fully operational and Cid gets it airborne within a matter of days.

<ul><li> Humans discovered the first prothean remains on Mars, which with its lack of plant or animal life, moisture, or tectonic activity, provided perfect conditions to preserve mechanical equipment under the sand for 50,000 years.
</li><li> The Citadel was actually quite intentionally Ragnarok proofed, being equipped with millions of drones that keep it in working order during the times between occupation by other races.
</li><li> Likewise, the Mass Relays have extremely advanced self-repair systems keeping them functioning for at least 50,000 years at a time. It is explicitly mentioned that one was caught in a supernova and was no worse for wear except that no one could find it again for a couple thousand years. Presumably the Relays are made from a material designed to last. They can also "quantum lock," becoming almost literally indestructible, when in extreme danger.
</li><li> However the Prothean Megacity on Feros, and the Archives on Ilos, definitely do fit under the trope. On the former thin vertical spires several <strong>kilometers</strong> high are still standing, even after said 50,000 years of weather erosion and simple decay. On the later there are still functioning power sources, elevators, lighting, force fields and elaborate Virtual Intelligence terminals (slightly degraded). Visually, they appear like 20th century constructions that have been abandoned for only 10 to 20 years. Though Vigil does say he had to turn off everyone's stasis pods to keep the power on.
</li><li> Which is again discussed in the <em>From Ashes</em> DLC mod for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: apparently the only reason the Prothean pods failed on Ilos was lack of power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There's still one pod with a very-much-alive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">inhabitant</a> in the Prothean bunker on Eden Prime</span>.
</li><li> In the second game, the Krogan homeworld of Tuchanka was apparently bombed into ruins during the Krogan Rebellions around 1000 AD. By AD 2185 it is apparently still in the grips of a nuclear winter complete with constant sandstorm, yet many of the ruins are still intact enough that you can find a recognisable radar dish, pyramidal skyscraper or even an unexploded bomb with the casing intact.
<ul><li> Even before the Krogan rebellions, their architecture was built with this in mind. In the second game it's mentioned that the hospitals are constructed like bunkers because injured Krogan have a tendency to succumb to Blood Rage and destroy everything in their path.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third game, Shepard travels through an Ancient Krogan temple complex with underground ruins, which despite being abandoned millennia ago, have survived remarkably well and only have a minimal amount of structural damage. A side-mission on Tuchanka involves a ground-to-space cannon that hasn't seen use since the Rebellions. Cerberus gets it up and running pretty quickly, which works out for you once you kill them.
</li><li> In one of the expanded endings of the third game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Reapers win, but you see one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture">Liara's time capsules</a> being activated during the next cycle, apparently none the worse for wear. Unlike the Protheans, Liara thought to make sure that people actually <em>understood</em> them, including a galactic Rosetta Stone in the design. Likewise, Liara made sure to seed the time capsules on <em>numerous</em> worlds so that <em>all</em> civilisations that might exist in the next Cycle would be able to find them.</span>
</li><li> One unexplained example are the cave paintings Shepard finds in the <em>Leviathan</em> DLC for the third game, which are heavily implied to have been painted <em>before</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Reapers ever started their extermination cycles</span>. If true, this would make those paintings <em>at least</em> a billion years old. Very impressive stone-age paint to have lasted that long on a planetary surface, not to mention the rock should have long since eroded away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> has the Remnant tech, which has been left sitting around for about four hundred years, some in extreme weather conditions, and on the whole is working perfectly well (or at least well enough). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even though the disaster which drove the Remnant builders away was deliberately aimed at them. However, the disaster does seem to have scrubbed any useful or coherent information that can be gleamed from most of their systems, so Ryder and SAM's efforts to get it working is mostly just guess-work.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> When you get to the sunken city of Thor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, long since destroyed by a meteor impact, the shield around it is still working perfectly. So by extension, so are the automatic doors, the TV (and video game system) in the pub, an electronic lock and card reader, the security systems, and the main computer Oz. Justified in that the city's power comes from the Spirit of Light, Aska. After the city's been pulled up from underwater, you can free Aska and have her join you. The city systems still somehow work after that, though...
<ul><li> Technology made by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Quartz</a>, ranging from a simple lever-operated door to an entire mobile fortress, works perfectly after 2000 years in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts">Tales of Hearts</a></em>.

When activated, the machine's holographic interface claims that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">it was built 30,000 years ago</a>, meaning it <em>predates the Republic itself.</em> Not only does the machine's computer still function, it analyzes the player and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass">determines that he or she is worthy</a> of viewing its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismantledMacguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismantledMacguffin">Star Map</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The first games have completely abandoned sewer systems that haven't collapsed fifty years after the last human could have walked through them.
</li><li> Computers and other electronics are in perfect working order, even if at least one area, the Glow, was directly hit by a nuke. There's a <em>slight</em> excuse for the electromagnetic pulse from a nuke that would normally fry computers: because the game is set in an alternate universe, they still use vacuum tubes for computing, and while that may be slower, clunkier, and overall less efficient, they lack the vulnerability to electromagnetic pulses that modern transistor-based computers have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> does play with this however: Vault 15 is nothing more than a New Khan hide out full of rust and tetanus with the generator barely functioning after a meager 80 years of being abandoned. The Chryslus Highwayman however works after 164 years of rusting in a nuclear desert after a full repair, living up to its slogan "Nothing can stop a Highwayman" (granted it could use some upgrades).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>: The game is set 200 years after the War.
<ul><li> There are still freestanding wooden house support beams, identifiable cars (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">that explode</a>), glass soda bottles that still have potable liquid in them, and <em>a standing Washington monument</em>.
</li><li> The most grievous example? Abraham Lincoln's <a class="urllink" href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=3">Henry Rifle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 1860, fully functional.
</li><li> A justified example, the N99 10mm pistol was intentionally designed and tested to endure the harshest conditions for extended periods of time with no maintenance. It more than lived up to its standards.
</li><li> There's edible left-over food. You don't want to know what's in the food that leaves it edible 200 years after a nuclear holocaust.
</li><li> One of the most egregious examples is the presence of a functioning power grid. Seriously, every single intact computer you find, even those in half-demolished, completely abandoned buildings, still somehow has a working power source, and underground utility tunnels still have working (although very dim) lights. And at least one computer entry mentions the user having found buried power lines and tapped into the still-functioning portions of the power grid. The explanation behind this is that the U.S. buried a number of backup nuclear power generators, and they're still connected to what's left of the grid and running strong 200 years later.
</li><li> Some of the power grid is restored with the use of car batteries, this is usually only found in human settlements. Where they get all of these fully functional batteries is another question.
</li><li> Remember, this is a divergent timeline with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomPunk">Atom Punk</a> setting. While it lags behind our own in certain departments such as computation (Although even with vacuum tubes instead of integrated circuits, they somehow have functional AI and humanoid robots), this setting has widespread use of portable fission power. Before the nuclear holocaust, pretty much everything in the US used to run on self-contained reactors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10vt8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10vt8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10vt8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, almost everything. <a class="urllink" href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline#2066">The lore<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> states that while there was a lot of fusion generators produced, not everyone could get them and the war slowed what little progress there was on them</span>, which could in theory remain operational for hundreds of years. Of course, they're still in need of incredibly resilient reaction control mechanisms and functional cooling to prevent a runaway meltdown...
</li><li> In the <em>Broken Steel</em> DLC, there's a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fully functional train from a largely destroyed secret subway system that connects from the remains of the U.S. Capitol Building and a sewer from the ruins of the White House to a nearby airbase that proves pivotal to the game's plot. For something that survived a war from over 200 years ago, it proved to be astonishingly resilient to rust and decay, and got even luckier when it completely avoided attempts at sabotage after the War.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> tones much of this down, but not entirely:
<ul><li> There are several power plants that provide energy to the Mojave area that use ambient energy sources, such as the hydroelectric Hoover Dam and the solar Helios One. They're considered an invaluable strategic resource and are hotly contested by various organizations in the setting. This still doesn't explain how various long-abandoned buildings have power, though.
</li><li> Most of the tech and items left in the wastes are either on the verge of breaking down permanently or (barely) held together by tape. The ones that <em>aren't</em> are usually those maintained and/or built by post-War factions like the NCR; the NCR's firepower in fact almost entirely avert this trope thanks to the Gun Runners mass-producing new firearms based on Pre-War schematics.
</li><li> The NCR has access to functional pre-War US Army trucks, which they used to haul some of their troops and supplies from California to their bases in the Mojave.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> The skyscrapers of Boston are somehow still standing after 210 years of neglect, complete with functional elevators. There are also many somewhat intact sections of elevated highways, some of which are used as settlements or raider/mercenary bases.
</li><li> Zigzagged with the Glowing Sea. Everything on the surface has been completely wiped out, with a few ruins indicating where buildings used to be. However, some buildings were buried by mudslides triggered by the nuke's detonation, and the interiors of these locations are well preserved and unlooted. Justified in that the surface is an incredibly hostile environment and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">native wildlife</a> doesn't take kindly to visitors.
</li><li> Most of the houses still have recognizable paint, wallpaper, and sometimes even Halloween decorations. The fridge in your own home has post-it notes which are still perfectly legible.
</li></ul></li><li> Across all games, everything also seems to be remarkably fireproof, for a postapocalyptic wasteland where all but the hardiest plants have whithered away, all the trees are dead, and the climate has been permanently set to sweltering summer desert heat, without rain. And people run around making campfires and using flamethrowers...
</li></ul></li><li> Used and abused in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series, which not only takes place over a period of thousands of years, but already has ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitech</a> in the chronological beginning, which is <em>still</em> running perfectly by the chronological end, despite being used (and not at all maintained) fairly frequently throughout. The only justification is the Master Sword, which is shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> to possess the ability to repair itself.
</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a> 2: Durandal</em> and <em>Infinity</em> (3rd game). The ruins of the S'pht civilization might look run down, but anything the player needs to use (Computer terminals, shield rechargers, doors, lifts, etc) works just fine. Lampshaded at least twice.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tycho:</strong> It's likely a quick and dirty patch into the durable S'pht hardware. These types of strongholds were build to outlast centuries of warfare.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Pfhor computer terminal:</strong> The quality of the machinery is quite extraordinary, and most of the computer terminals are still functional even after two thousand years.
</div><ul><li> Justified, in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the S'pht have been so advanced for so long that prior to meeting the Pfhor couldn't conceive of non-cybernetic intelligence. They were originally created to serve as servants of the Jjaro, a race so advanced that they could warp entire planets instantly through space millions of years before the game's timeline.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> - This trope inverted may actually justify the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stating that all six games take place on the same <em>very</em> unlucky planet... just thousands upon thousands of years apart. After all, technology just doesn't last! You've still got facilities/bits of tech built thousands of years before game start <em>in working order</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms3">3</a></em>.
</li><li> Overplayed to the extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>. At one point in the game, Shadow and Rouge are forcibly sent to a post-apocalyptic future 200 years from the game's "present" complete with a city that is mostly intact only perpetually on fire. Conveniently, Sonic and his pals were sent to the same future in the same area by sheer coincidence, so they work together to form a portal back to the present. It works, but Shadow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finds the guy who zapped him and Rouge to this hellhole in the first place, and misses the portal closing in an attempt to get answers from him</span>. Rouge's solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To put a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin">Mineral MacGuffin</a> in her robot friend E-123 Omega's glove compartment and put him on sleep mode for the next two hundred years so Shadow can find him in the future and use it to teleport back in time.</span> Needless to say, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he survives Armageddon unscathed</span> and the plan works perfectly.
<ul><li> Probably justified, since they already know that the plan will work due to time shenanigans, as the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">never really makes up its mind on how the time travel works</a>. It's a minor plot hole in a game riddled with huge ones. Also, it's a Chaos Emerald, the series' go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> for any given miracle required. It could probably not only stop itself from being destroyed, but also protect a sleep mode enabled Omega.
</li><li> The same post-apocalyptic volcano city has working electricity, computers that are perfectly functional, and Sonic is even able to look up old news articles, implying one <em>hell</em> of a sysadmin is still devoted to doing their job.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> features the Lost City of Ehn'gha, constructed by a long-dead race that inhabited the Earth before mankind showed up. It's remarkably intact, though its use as a Guardian colony may have something to do with that. Another "forbidden city" is slightly less intact but still standing strong after twenty centuries, and in fact one of the protagonists is forced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to perform routine maintenance. The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Tome of Eldritch Lore</a> also manages to survive for longer than your average book would, but then again, it <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">protected by Magick</a>.
</li><li> A strangely appropriate trope for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>, where the Juperos Ruins and its machinations are still in surprisingly good shape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033">Metro 2033</a></em> averts this: it's only been 20 years, but the subway system has taken a heavy toll. Considering how long the planned lifetime for these facilities is, decay can be attributed more to poor maintenance than to time alone. After entering the legendary D-6, intended to be the command center of the Russian government before the nuclear apocalypse, a casual lean on a railing causes it to fall off.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Miller</strong>: Careful, damn it! Twenty years without maintenance is too much even for Soviet military structures! Everyone watch your step!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> takes place several hundred years after the end of the first game, with the protagonist having been trapped in the Enrichment Center in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryogenic stasis</a>. It initially looks like an aversion, as the place is rather thoroughly wrecked, but the portal gun still works as do many of the center's mechanisms. In particular, GLaDOS is still around, and once you restore power, she rapidly goes about repairing the facility. Less explicable is how the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">original Enrichment Center</span>, four kilometers beneath the surface and abandoned before even the first game without the benefits of a caretaker AI, remains functional.
<ul><li> Aperture Science themselves seem to have prepared accordingly for this type of scenario.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Announcer:</strong> Hello, and again, welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties due to circumstances of potentially apocalyptic significance beyond our control.

But given one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GammaWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GammaWorld">settings</a> the game homages, that shouldn't be a surprise.

Yet much of it looks more or less as it did during the outbreak of its Civil War: the lights are still on, VA systems are (mostly) operational and everything's (barring some wet parts) in working order. Justified in that said mess only happened about a year before the player shows up.

</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation">Long Now Foundation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> intends to build a clock capable of keeping time for 10000 years. It will be accompanied by a large selection of high-tech <em>cave paintings</em>, ranging from schematics of the clock to a microprinted encyclopedia.
</li><li> Egyptian tombs were also deliberate attempts at Ragnarök Proofing, as the ancient Egyptians believed the body had to remain intact forever for their afterlife to work properly. They didn't have all that much success, at least in the case of the Pharaohs, as the conspicuous and treasure-filled tombs tended to draw robbers. That being said, the mummies themselves, while they aren't exactly full-fleshed, still have some meat on their bones, which is almost achievement enough for any sort of organic material that old.
<ul><li> What's inside them may be (as a rule) long gone to looters... the pyramids themselves are a powerful example of this trope. The Great Pyramid is over four thousand years old and spent most of that time as the tallest structure on the planet. It lacks only its limestone facade from ancient times; much of which was deliberately removed a few centuries later, to use for building the houses, palaces, mosques, and other monuments of nearby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo">Cairo</a> (the great <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Citadel">Citadel of Cairo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> built by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Saladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Saladin">Saladin</a> is partly built with these blocks). Barring the destructive impulses of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">creators</a> the Great Pyramid will likely last on a geological timescale.
</li><li> Ironically just dropping a body in the sand will preserve it very well as it will dry out and plenty of soft tissue (skin) will survive. Burying a body in a coffin in sand retains enough moisture to let the body rot leaving just bones (both types of actual remains can be seen in the British Museum). Thus the entire mummification process is an attempt to recreate (and improve) the effect of the very simplest form of burial.
</li></ul></li><li> We really don't build them the way the Romans used to. Almost all of the buildings in the ancient Roman city of Ostia Antica are over a thousand years old; most of them closer to two thousand years old. It's still safe to wander up to the top of millennia-old blocks of flats to look at the cityscape, while in Rome it's completely fine to walk through the forum and around the buildings that have survived centuries of conquest, city expansion and military squabbling. Pompeii and Herculaneum are similar examples, although they did have the advantage of being buried for most of that time. And some Roman roads are still in use today.
<ul><li> Best example: Roman aqueducts. Many are essentially functional after a couple millennium of being in service. Carrying one of the main causes of erosion no less.
</li><li> Most buildings made of brick and stone are technically Ragnarök Proof. The best example are medieval houses and cathedrals that are several centuries old (some churches may be more than 1000 years old) and they are still in use. Despite weather, wars and natural disasters. In Central Europe, many 19th-century townhouses are in definitely better shape (despite lack of maintenance) than concrete housing projects built in the 1950s and '60s.
</li><li> The biggest danger to Greek and Roman ruins is modern air pollution. Acid rain, ozone, and other pollutants are destroying them rapidly.
</li><li> Perhaps the most impressive example is the Pantheon in Rome, which was revolutionary for its time and is still of a design that nobody today would insure, yet it's given constant use for 1500 years.
</li><li> A lot of people don't realise that the Parthenon in Athens is not ruined thanks to the effects of time. It was accidentally blown up during the Greece-Ottoman civil war in the 19th Century: because someone had the bright idea to use it as a powder magazine. A stray lightning strike (or perhaps deliberate sabotage, nobody really knows) and the building ended up in roughly its modern appearance. Then the Brits came and stripped the murals off the façade. If not for human stupidity and colonialism, it would be basically intact. The rest of the buildings on the Acropolis, most of which are even older than the Parthenon (which is a whopping 2,500 years old), are mostly still intact.
</li><li> Many islands in Japan's Ryukyu archipelago construct all structures and surface infrastructures out of reinforced concrete. The reason is the archipelago sits in what one could call "Typhoon alley", and will have as many as half a dozen typhoons per year easy with super typhoons (with wind gusts up to 250MPH) hitting once every few years. Aside from cleaning up greenery that had been strewn all over, business can essentially go on as usual the moment wind gusts drop to reasonable levels.
</li></ul></li><li> In the days before computers could tell you <em>exactly</em> how much cement was needed or bricks were required to do a job, the standard way of doing things was to throw as much stuff as possible in, unintentionally Ragnarök Proofing some things. Hoover Dam, for example, would likely stand for quite some time. Similarly, the Brooklyn Bridge was built in the 1870s to accommodate horse and buggy traffic, and now supports thousands of cars and trucks each day.
</li><li> Windsor Castle is another excellent example, having been continuously used for almost 1,000 years right the way up to the present day, it's had plenty of additions made to it over the centuries by a multitude of monarchs. Having been never successfully stormed (or even attacked), it stands almost as an insult to anyone who's ever tried, or even thought of trying to take it down, and it will likely stay that way for centuries to come.
</li><li> Albert Speer, chief architect and arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in Hitler's inner circle, pioneered the concept of "ruin value". Taking a note from ancient Greek and Roman buildings, he argued that future Reich buildings and monuments should be built to last and from appropriate materials so that, when they eventually degraded, they would leave behind aesthetically pleasing ruins like the Colosseum and the Parthenon. Few of his designs were ever realized. His "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Chancellery">Reich Chancellery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" was demolished by the Red Army and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ruins were used to make a Soviet war memorial</a>. "Ruin value" indeed.
<ul><li> Contrary to that, the buildings that were actually finished (and survived until now) are notorious for their haphazard and shoddy construction. Of course the short timespan of the Nazi rule didn't allow for projects that would take some decades to complete, so the things that were built were done so under serious time pressure (and Hitler's constant fiddling with details, so that plans had to be completely rewritten during construction). The best example might be the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg. The construction was constrained by the yearly party rally (at which the new buildings had to be "finished"), so a lot of shortcuts were taken. Still, most of the structures seen in photos and films are actually mock-ups, representing buildings to be built in the future. The majestic "Zeppelin grandstand" is anything but a solid building - for the most part, it is a hollow prop. Today it is so derelict that the city faces renovation costs of about 70 to 80 million euros, just to preserve it in its current state (otherwise it would have to be closed for the public due to safety concerns).
</li></ul></li><li> In 2012, a time capsule that had been entombed for 100 years was removed from the cornerstone of a GE building in Cleveland, OH. In addition to documents and photographs, it contained five light bulbs, at least one of which <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/03/general_electric_opens_time_ca.html">worked fine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> When firearms need to be stored for long periods of time, governments usually dip them in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmoline">cosmoline<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to keep air and moisture from rusting steel parts. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a> did this with their <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin-nagant">Mosin-Nagant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> bolt-action rifles, and because so many of the Model 1891/30 variants of the rifle survive today, they are sold to civilians for around $90 each in the United States.
<ul><li> One can also get Soviet surplus ammunition, usually from the 1960s or 1970s, but sometimes earlier. It's not uncommon to be at the range and realize that you're firing a weapon and ammunition with a combined age of well over 100 years.
</li><li> Firearm survival has a lot to do with quality of steel construction, wood treatment and storage. Nitro Express rifles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">from the 1880s</a>, if properly cared for, can fire just fine today. What makes the Mosin-Nagant so impressive is the fact it has been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">cheap weapon from the start</a>, and yet it performs like new... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily">just like the AK-47s do</a>.
</li><li> In general, military equipment can to survive and function for sometimes ridiculous lengths of time without any maintenance or care, or sometimes even in environments that you'd think would disintegrate it utterly, due to deliberately sturdy designs that can withstand all manner of ill treatment. So often you have cases of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL6VVpHLXeE">Mauser K98 rifles that have bolts that still cycle after 60 years at the bottom of a muddy well,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOMiRsodVHk">Soviet T-34 tanks whose running gear hasn't locked up and even have intact electrical systems and paint jobs after being pulled out of a bog half a century later,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> One notable exception to this is some US military hardware, particularly anything built since the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, largely as a consequence of the budget cuts. Military hardware is designed to be maintained by teams of mechanics. Many US trucks and arms are meant to be worked on by teams and given daily, weekly and monthly maintenance checks. If abandoned, or neglected, seals dry rot, fluids evaporate and parts rust. It's made worse that some pieces of US kit are COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) so they aren't made to the tougher military specs.
</li><li> Both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted Trope</a> and played straight with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Girl">Glacier Girl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. She was a P-38 lost under the ice in Greenland. Found but unflyable, she was restored after lots of work.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kee_Bird">Kee Bird<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another example. She was a B-29 found to be <em>flyable</em> after <strong>50 years</strong> on a <em>frozen lake</em>. Sadly a broken generator caught fire and <em>Kee Bird</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">went up in flames</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/309th_Aerospace_Maintenance_and_Regeneration_Group">ARMARC<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Boneyard" is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a>. Tucson Arizona was chosen as the massive storage area due to the dry climate and the hard soil. Many aircraft have returned to service or others scrapped. Even then, special procedures are taken to make sure the planes are preserved. Most involved removal of ordinance, batteries, fuel and oils.
</li></ul></li><li> Most industrial and transportation machinery has been designed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">for a industrial economy</a> and therefore it relies on a steady stream of replacement parts, consumables and fuel to run. <br/>Even if there is a hidden fuel cache to power them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, acid batteries will die after 4-5 years at best, the essential timing belts will dry rot in mostly 5 years, tires will start to crack after 5-6 years and crumble altogether after 10-15 years if lucky. Hydraulic seals will last a few more years, but only if the machine was driven intermittently with fluids in the system. Making a bodywork immune to rust or protecting the machine underground from weather and violence remains useless. <br/>Steam Age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">and early 20th century machinery</a> had been designed with lower performance expectations in mind during a less technically advanced time and it will last much better. Steam engines and "semi-Diesel" <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_bulb_engine">hot bulb engines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can be restored with little effort after being buried (protected with grease) in earth or mud for 50-60 years.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.fi/2009/01/weapons-cache-case-how-finns-faced-down.html">Weapons Cache Case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. During the Summer 1944 the Finnish Army, fearing defeat and occupation by USSR, arranged a weapons caching: small arms and mortars and their ammunition were hidden all around Finland, to enable quick mobilization of partisan war. The war ended on favorable terms, but before the caches were dismantled, the Communists became interested. Hence, many of the caches were left hidden. As it is almost 70 years now and most of the involved are dead, undismantled caches turn up every now and then. Usually the weapons are rusted or inoperable, <em>but sometimes they appear in fully greased and oiled and ready for use</em> condition.
</li><li> Mount Rushmore, and the nearby Crazy Horse monument still in progress. They are in an area that is geologically stable and not prone to natural disaster. The granite facing erodes at a rate of roughly 1 inch per 10,000 years. Rushmore should be distinguishable as a non-natural construct for over 1 million years, and will exist for an estimated 7.2 million years, and Crazy Horse possibly longer (being the larger). Indeed they only disaster likely to befall them is if the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera">Yellowstone Supervolcano<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> decided to erupt, which would probably just bury them, protecting them from the elements more than damaging them.
</li><li> It was once believed that the Germanic invaders of post-Roman Britain had some kind of superstitious horror of stone buildings, and deliberately trashed the Romano-British cities. Today it's reckoned that the towns were simply abandoned as law and order, government services and the cash economy broke down, and entropy, aided by country dwellers cannibalising the buildings for stone and metal, did the rest.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalhoyuk">Çatalhöyük<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> dates back to 7500 BC and yet still has remains still intact enough for us to reconstruct their culture, although much of it had to be dug up and restored. It's the best-preserved Neolithic site.
</li><li> Many nuclear bunkers have been abandoned since at least the end of the Cold War and, more often than not, well before that and have managed to survive in an almost untouched state since then. When you think about it, these structures use many of the same techniques as underground tombs but with an even greater emphasis on keeping out air, only the whole thing is done by a much more advanced civilization.
<ul><li> Speaking of bunkers, even the conventional air-raid shelters in Germany had objections against being blown up after they were no longer needed with the end of WWII. Since that's the whole point of an air-raid shelter. Many are still standing.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese firm <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi">Hitachi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has developed a prototype data storage device based on quartz glass that it believes could store data without degrading indefinitely- potentially millions of years or longer.
</li><li> Stuff left in space will last <em>a lot</em> of time (if it's functional or not after that time is another different topic, and it will most definitely be heavily irradiated). The footprints left in the moondust by the Apollo astronauts alone are expected to last millions of years and those (robotic) spacecraft abandoned after their mission has ended may last longer, especially the ones that are leaving the Solar System as the Voyagers or the Pioneers that perhaps could endure <em>billions</em> of years.
</li><li> Before the cathedral was finished, a wooden medieval crane was the most prominent landmark of Cologne. It was installed atop the south tower of the cathedral probably around 1350 and remained there after work on the Cathedral stopped. In 1868, they finally finished the south tower, so the crane had to go. Souvenirs and several chairs were made from its wood.
</li><li> Modern skyscrapers are expected to be Ragnarok Proof, provided they are encased with glass. While steel can and will eventually rust, no matter how protection has been applied, glass does not degrade, so if the glass remains intact, the air and carried moisture inside the skyscraper will not change, thus it has no real way to attack the metal skeleton. Due to this, skyscrapers may be able to survive thousands of years relatively intact, unless the glass mantle gets destroyed or removed on a massive scale for some reason.
</li><li> South of Oslo City, but inside the city limits, one important route of traffic rests on a medieval stone bridge - which, as it turns out, carries heavy trucks of the modern age with remarkable ease.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with LED lights. Manufacturers like Philips and Cree tote that their emitters can last in constant use for several dozen thousands of hours, up to 100,000. That's more than <em>five years</em> of continuous lighting. There's a caveat, though: just because the emitter could last that long<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hyu9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3hyu9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hyu9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">provided it's not driven at high currents too frequently and has enough heatsinking to not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating">overheat</a></span>, all bets are off if the rest of the device will keep up as well; in fact, LED lamps often fail because the driver board the emitter needs to modulate the power input fries or oxidizes into uselessness, while the LED itself is mostly intact.
</li><li> It's actually entirely possible to do this for a lot of machines or structures but there just isn't a need to. Even with the idea of planned obsolescence, a lot of things just become obsolete before they stop functioning. Are you really going to pay extra for a computer that can last a thousand years when you are going to throw it out in four anyway?
