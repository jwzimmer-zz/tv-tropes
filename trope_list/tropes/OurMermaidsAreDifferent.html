However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent">like most mythical creatures and monsters</a>, they are a little different every time and have different rules applied to them. Their dispositions, morality, and alliances vary depending on the author, and whether or not they can become human is a question everyone answers differently. Even their general appearance isn't fixed: see the picture.
</p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong>
Merfolk are generally portrayed as beautiful women (mermaids) or handsome men (mermen) with fish- or dolphin-like tails in place of legs. Sometimes they are not <em>so</em> pretty, but still fall under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> heading. Others are more blatantly sea-creatures with few human characteristics and are quite ugly, for example the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> merman (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">mermaid?</a>) pictured. Sometimes they have features reminiscent of other, more exotic sea-creatures, and sometimes they <em>are</em> sea-animals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">become human-like</a> under certain circumstances.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Some joke that merfolk must have the fish half on top instead of on the bottom in order to resolve "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">Mermaid Problem</a>". Mermaids who are more human-looking (and modest) tend to wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeashellBra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeashellBra">Seashell Bras</a>. And then there's underwater folk like Aquaman, Namor the Submariner, <em>The Man From Atlantis</em> etc. who look like normal humans for the most part but can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyHumanMerfolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyHumanMerfolk">survive and breathe underwater</a> and may have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">odd physical adaptations that are well-hidden</a> until they return to the sea.
</p><p>It should also be noted that most mermaids have the "fish half" in a cetacean (horizontal fluke) configuration, rather than a fish's vertical configuration, since this is closer to how an actual human swims, though exceptions exist.
</p><p>Finally, given that there are more than 15,000 species of fishes in Earth's oceans, the actual <em>kind</em> of fish-tail which even a traditional mermaid might sport provides yet another basis for diversity of appearance among them. Of course, a sizable fraction of mermaid imagery doesn't actually replicate <em>any</em> extant fish, but just starts out with a feminine hip-bulge and tapers the tail down to a big wide fin.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">Merperson to Human:</a></strong>
Sometimes merpeople can turn into humans, or vice versa, under certain circumstances. The way this is done and differences in the "rules" surrounding this are numerous:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash">Splash</a></em> Method: The mermaid can become human when they are dry and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifter">turn back when wet</a>. Sometimes this is something all merpeople can do, and sometimes there are limits on how long they can do it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></em> Method: The mermaid invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">a magic spell</a> which allows them to turn human. Sometimes, this is at a hefty cost. In the original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, it's the title's character's tongue; the sea-witch responsible expects payment, and specifies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">"the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught."</a>. May be combined with the above.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">The Fredericka Bimm Method</a>: Mermaids can switch forms more or less at will. Unlike the <em>Splash</em> method, getting doused with water is not a problem.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">The Magical Item Method</a>: Common in some mythologies but, curiously, not often utilized in modern fiction, aside from anime and magical girl genre. The Mermaid has a magical item which allows her to change from one form to another. Some of these items are obvious; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals">Selkie</a> needs her shed seal-skin to return to her home in the sea. Or a mermaid could pass for human on land in a wheelchair. Others are... kind of random; a Merrow needs a hat made of red feathers to (depending on which variant on the legend you are reading) return to the sea or assume human form.
</li><li> And of course, some mermaids don't possess shapeshifting abilities at all — no matter how much they may want to change, the half-fish appearance is their default, permanent form.
</li></ul><p><strong>Good or Evil?:</strong>
Sometimes mermaids are portrayed as evil seductresses (sometimes called devil fish) who lure sailors to their deaths<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0a58j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0a58j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0a58j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is based on the myths of sirens which were originally birdwomen but who are generally portrayed as mermaids these days <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">due to language confusion</a></span>. Others, their singing is a sign of disaster, but not from seduction. In most mythologies, they display the inscrutable and sometimes dangerous amorality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, especially if mermaids are treated as marine fae. Sometimes they are good but flirty and mischievous. Sometimes they are mostly innocent and naive. Sometimes they are honorable, and of these, several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">resent us</a> for treating their ocean home so badly for so long. Sometimes (just sometimes) they are just like us and have all sorts of personas. Very often, though not always, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>, or even outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> types. Octopus or Squid-based mermaids—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cilia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cilia">sometimes called cilophytes or cecaelia</a>—are usually portrayed as evil, probably owing to the influence of Disney's sea-witch Ursula, or perhaps because of the "alien" nature of tentacles.
</p><p>One thing that also tends to vary among depictions of mermaids is their ability to survive on land: some depictions show them being completely unable to breathe out of water, others show them being able to stay above the surface but needing to be wet to avoid drying out, and some show no qualms at all about leaving the sea and can stay out of water seemingly indefinitely (except for not having legs).
</p><p>Most merfolk can communicate with fish and sea creatures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">regardless of whether they eat them or not</a>. Expect merfolk to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedExtraterrestrials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedExtraterrestrials">remain naked</a> no matter how deep they swim or how little protection their skin has, though their bodies might have some unseen protection against the cold and high pressure of the depths.
</p><p>Many artists portray merfolk as having human-like knee and ankle joints instead of a spinal column. They'd probably swim much like a human using a monofin, a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monofin">single large flipper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to use both legs at once. If you watch swimming competitions you do notice that when they are underwater (after kicking off the end) they do keep their legs together and use an undulating motion. A horizontal fluke just extends this motion.

While fitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> trope in many ways, they are not your traditional style of mermaid, considering that they have a tendency to bite.

</li><li> In a story arc of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> manga, a race of giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Fish People</a> from another dimension called Chip Kamoy attempted to invade Earth. In order to communicate with human beings, they kidnapped a human girl and transformed her into a mermaid: her legs were replaced by a long fish tail, and fins grew from her head.

The final "moral" is that people liking regular mermaids is the reason the population is decreasing: Put up with your partner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureisANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureisANonCute">even if they have a fish face</a>.

Additionally, her human form is quite different looking from her mermaid form besides just the obvious lack of tail. The main character also sacrifices her voice — but <em>just</em> her singing voice (she can sing beautifully as a mermaid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButCacophonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButCacophonic">not so much as a human</a>).

The first is human-type merfolk, which look like traditional mermaids. They can sing enchanting songs to lure adventurers into the water. The other is fish-type merfolk (mermen), which wield tridents and look like fish with human arms. They're more fish than human, though, since they hatch from eggs and spend their juvenile stage looking like regular fish. The two species are apparently unrelated, as a mermaid happily eats a juvenile merman in a side-chapter.

They can remain in human form as long as they don't get sufficiently wet (which isn't too much.) Nagasumi spends a lot of time drying off Sun just to avoid having her secret discovered by others. Adults grow out of this, and it is possible for younger mermaids to resist the change with limited success if they are disciplined enough. Their songs can cause a variety of status effects.

Her magic is strong but useless in the absence of water, although she can also use it to give herself a pair of shapely legs to keep up with the gang out of water. She is the younger sister of the Queen of the mermaids, which of course makes her a mermaid princess.

If he is about to drown, he'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">change in order to be able to breathe</a>: this is how he was forced to do it in the circus.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> anime series, there's a mermaid that's a fish. Literally, just a fish... with tetrapod arms and legs. Not a reverse mermaid. A *whole fish* with legs, arms... oh, and lipstick. There are other merfolk seen in the earlier (1st and 3rd) series; turns out they <em>all</em> look like fish with arms and legs.

Merfolks are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></em> type.

Even so, they are the fastest swimmers in the world. In both cases, the types of fish they're similar to, and thus their physical features, greatly vary. Merfolk and Fishmen can intermarry, but instead of being hybrids, each child can be either a mermaid/man or a fish(wo)man.

She's amphibious, able to breathe air so long as it's humid, but needs to use a wheelchair to get around on land, lacking any ability to shapeshift. It's very strongly indicated that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">Mermaid Problem</a> would <em>not</em> be a problem if she wanted to mate with a human; in hindsight, the gothic-lolita-style skirt she wears <em>does</em> cover the one part of the body you'd assume there to be a problem...
<ul><li> The setting has other kinds of merfolk as well; some are based on different types of fish, such as eel mermaids and shark mermaids, while others combine fish and human characteristics in different ways, such as a fish with legs or a woman with an entire fish for a head.

Most obviously, they have fin ears and a lower-body like their type-fish, as well as elaborate hairstyles, but other traits also cross over, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlluringAnglerfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlluringAnglerfish">Alluring Anglerfishes</a> with lures on their heads, sharks with serrated fangs and poor vision, pufferfish who can distend their cheeks and who have poisonous skin, eels who secrete slime when nervous, and discus fish who secrete milk when excited. They also live in a world in which they take "Mer-Meds", a medicine that lets them transform their tail into human legs so they can interact with humans. The star of the manga is a cute little anglerfish mermaid and her best friend, a somewhat perverted human girl who's fascinated by mermaids.

Like the rest they are mammals evolved from apes and can interbreed. These mermaids are mammalian, with their legs joined into a tail at around knee level, fins on their hips, and a tendency to not wear shirts unless other races are around and would object. Most mermaids live in places that are kept flooded by at least a few feet so they can get around. Anywhere else and they have to be carried or rely on technology.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, the spirit forms of The Watery and The Bubbles cards are mermaids.

She has swimming-skins between her fingers and toes, and also ears that look like swim fins.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermanInMyTub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermanInMyTub">Merman In My Tub</a></em> has a dorky and androgynous merman named Wakasa, who lives in the bathtub of a human guy named Tatsumi. Not able to survive out of the water for long, most of the episodes take place in the bathroom, where Tatsumi is forced to awkwardly share the tub with him.
<ul><li> Later episodes included more characters, including Takasu (a half-octopus merman), Mikuni (a jellyfish) and Maki (a tiny snail-person). The Manga also featured Agari, a shark merman.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has had a variety of merfolk cards throughout the years, usually as small utility creatures, and have been a standard Blue tribe. Since the game takes place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">multiverse</a>, Merfolk are different on each plane that has them. They range in appearance from deep-sea fish to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HellBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HellBoy">Abe Sapien</a>. There are a few subraces of particular note:
<ul><li> The Rootwater merfolk of Rath are hideous, fish-faced monsters that kill members of any other race without hesitation. They apparently started out as the more standard Dominarian merfolk but were altered via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">genetic engineering</a>.
</li><li> The merfolk of Saprazzo in the <em>Mercadian Masques</em> set have the power to switch between legs and fins. On land, they just look like lanky, hairless, blue-skinned humans, sometimes with head fins. They have a vaguely Middle Eastern culture.
</li><li> The <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Onslaught</em> blocks introduced Cephalids, a squid-based type of merfolk that were more squid than humanoid, with soft bodies and limited mobility out of water. In keeping with the "evil tentacles" motif, most of the cephalids were right bastards.
</li><li> The merrows of Lorwyn are the usual attractive human-looking merfolk, though they have brightly colored skin and flamboyant fins; they're merchants and porters with good diplomatic skills. When Lorwyn is transformed into the dark world of Shadowmoor, though, the merrows become black-hearted monsters with much more piscine features (very similar to the Rootwater merfolk of Rath) who prey on other races as pirates. The comparison here: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=139400">Lorwyn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a bit fishy but friendly-looking. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=158234">Shadowmoor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, looking like a cross between a catfish and Cthulhu.
</li><li> Interestingly, because of their position as small blue creatures, combined with the fact that blue gets small flying creatures, there are a number of merfolk in Magic that can fly. The weirdest example would have to be Gaea's Skyfolk, an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HybridMonster">Elf Merfolk</a>" who flies. There has been no attempt to explain this, unlike the other 8 merfolk flyers.
</li><li> More modern MtG merfolk come with legs, which allows sea-themed races without the entire oddness of creatures that can swim in water, and so should beat any non-water breather there, but that can't do much in the atmosphere.
<ul><li> Zendikar's merfolk are also heavy on flyers, some — but not all — due to riding large birds or flying manta rays. They also had a rather well fleshed out tripartite religion centering on Leviathans and Angels <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which unfortunately turned out to be based on distant memories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the Eldrazi</a></span>. They also have continuing extraplanar representation in the form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionalTraveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionalTraveller">planeswalker</a> Kiora.
</li><li> The Tritons of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>-inspired Theros are distinguished by large, trailing head-fins resembling the plumes of ancient Greek war helmets. They're partially amphibious — they can stay on dry land for several days, but must return to the water to keep their gills soft — and worship Thassa, the God of the Sea, above all other deities. Thassa herself is depicted as a traditional, fish-tailed merfolk with several tentacles growing from her back and shoulders.
</li><li> The merfolk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWorld">Ixalan</a>, the River Heralds, are colorful, resembling tropical river fish. They are also nomadic in nature, use jade jewelry and armor and are aligned with Green mana as well as Blue.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a>'s ex, Lori Lemaris, is a mermaid (it's... complicated) who lived on land by using a wheelchair and keeping her tail covered. Eventually she was magically given the power to turn into a human (any contact with water changes her back, though.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, the comic adaptation <em>of</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Adapatation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a>,</em> Gill Girl is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPerson">Fish Person</a> who, unlike most, isn't human-looking enough to be your typical hot mermaid. She is tearing up the city searching for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her mate... revealed to be a normal, non-anthropomorphic turtle.</span> Other than her (and we don't get her story) most Atlanteans are of the Aquaman/Aqualad entirely human-looking style (except for the solid-black eyes, in Aqualad's case [purple-irised in the original comics].)
<ul><li> Gill Girl was possibly inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> character Lagoon Boy, who was introduced in Erik Larsen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em> run as a representative of one of various oceanic humanoid races who comprised Atlantis' minority groups (merfolk and Aquaman-type humanoids being the majority). L.B. is basically a teenage version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>, with the ability to expand like a puffer fish.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> Atlanteans, and various subraces, are an interesting example. Their appearance generally depends on what continuity is active at the time. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, Marvel Atlanteans were the human inhabitants of Atlantis until it sank, whereupon they were turned into blue-skinned water breathers by the god Neptune. In earlier comics, the men looked like fishmen and they weren't actually <em>from</em> Atlantis. When Namor was reintroduced in the 1960s with the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby retconned the Submariners (what they used to call Namor's mother's race) to Atlanteans as water breathing blue-skinned people. Hybrids apparently can breathe air, are stronger than either race, and can fly with wings on their feet. There were also green-skinned fish-men who were the later Lemurian offshoot, mutated by the snake-god they worshiped.
<ul><li> Namor is the only one with the wings though, and that's because <em>in addition</em> to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a>, he is also a mutant.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrossGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrossGen">CrossGen</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Scion">Scion</a></em> has a variety of humanoid sea-dwellers who were descended from a genetically-engineered servant species, but had broken free and lived in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity">Underwater City</a>. They were smallish, gray humanoids with two legs and gills.
<ul><li> And their leaders (?) look like giant, luminescent brine shrimp. No, I'm not joking.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em>, Atlanteans are humanoid amphibious aliens with dolphin-like skin, gills, and small fins on their arms and legs to assist in swimming.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatCake">Meat Cake</a></em> has Effluvia, a beautiful but slutty mermaid who flirts with sailors — and then lures them to their deaths and turns their souls into jewelry. She travels about on land with a wheelchair, usually.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em>, Abe Sapien is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">gill-man</a>. A good-natured, erudite, streamlined gill-man.
<ul><li> In Hellboy: The Third Wish, the title character meets some mermaids, including the Bog Roosh, a mermaid-witch who captures him and wants to kill him to prevent the apocalypse.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> spin-off <em>Wave Dancers</em> played with this in several ways. (The "mermaids" were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">space elves</a> modified by magic to live in the water. Exactly <em>how</em> they were modified varied wildly.)
<ul><li> One of the females is the octopus variation, but not shunned or evil. Her lower half looks like a hoop skirt made of tentacles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fathom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fathom">Fathom</a></em> is about a race of beings who can turn into water or use it as a weapon, among other things.
</li><li> The silver age comic Sea Devils had a good example of this trope in one issue with the Sea Devils themselves being turned into various forms of nontraditional merfolk including a manta ray, sea horse and shark.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Swordquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Swordquest">Swordquest: Waterworld</a></em> has the Aqualanians, a race of undersea merpeople; aside from their yellow-green skin and green hair, they look like humans (complete with legs) and are capable of breathing air.

<ul><li> Main character Remora, who has taught us a lot of unexpected things about merfolk over the years. For example, they use bubbles for currency. Not sure what they use for a wallet. They also have the option of either being a merperson 24 hours a day or splitting their time between being a human for half the day and a fish the other half. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">the mermen</a> that get pregnant, as Thomas found out the hard way.</span> Probably the most notable thing though is, if a human saves a merperson's life three times, they themselves become a merperson. And 'saving' can be something as simple as tossing them a flotation ring or signing legislature.
</li><li> As it turns out...merfolk are of <em>alien</em> origin, as the first thing Samantha discovered when she studied their genome is that they didn't evolve on Earth. It turns out merfolk originated on Venus, tried moving to Earth when Venus became uninhabitable, and modern merfolk descend from those left behind when the rest of the species left Earth after finding it too dangerous (Remora suspects it was because they missed the ride, rather than any bravado on their part).
</li><li> Enough of their DNA remained on Mars that, when Samantha terraformed it, merfolk began appearing in Mars's lake...except since the dodos have made their home there, the Martian merfolk are half fish, half <em>dodo</em>. This causes Samantha to theorize that merfolk take on whatever the dominant species on a planet was as their top half, and goes on to further suggest that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockNessMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockNessMonster">plesiosaurs</a> were what merfolk looked like in the age of the dinosaurs.
</li></ul></li><li> The short-lived 1980's comic strip <em>Norb</em> by Tony Auth and Daniel Pinkwater visited Atlantis once, and that story arc ended with the implication that Jacobowitz was about to get romantic with a mermaid... one with the head and body of a fish, and the legs of a beautiful woman.

<ul><li> Namor appears towards the end of the first book, first stabilizing a collapsing SHIELD Helicarrier, then intervening at the Battle of London, smashing open HYDRA's base atop a colossal sea serpent, whilst bellowing his catchphrase. Like canon, he looks more or less human, and he has an ambivalent attitude to the surface world - he respects certain humans (holding Steve in particular in very high regard), but is fairly suspicious of humanity as a whole, feeling out a potential alliance with Magneto.
</li><li> More inhuman varieties, closer to fae than human, such as Sirens, are referenced, and their relatives, Undines, appear in the sequel, complete with hypnotic singing. Harry mostly just finds it annoying and tells them — at which point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">they get annoyed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">at his insulting their music</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/StrangeScales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/StrangeScales">Strange Scales</a></em> introduces mermaids as a third race of immortals. Like vampires, humans can be turned into mermaids and subsequently gain an appetite for blood (as well as obviously eating marine life). While they obviously gain a tail in place of legs, they can also return to a human form if brought to land, although they can only communicate in English while underwater, requiring the Cullens to learn Mermish through Edward translating based on the characters' thoughts (characters speculate that they could make a "mask" that would allow Bella to talk by placing water over her mouth, but no such mask is created in the narrative).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhatTheWaterGaveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhatTheWaterGaveMe">What The Water Gave Me</a></em>: Mermaids are an all-female race of creatures that have a powerful, hypnotic song and a taste for human flesh (especially men). They lure sailors along, then they snatch them up, mate with them and then eat them. Despite this, they do possess intelligence and personalities close to humans, with the power to imbue humans the power to breath underwater through a kiss and the even worship a mystical force they call "the Water", which turned Hiccup, Valka and Astrid into merpeople. Hiccup is currently the only merman in existence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Kindred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Kindred">Kindred</a></em> explains mermaid biology in Ariel's oneshot: Ariel is a warm-water Pacific ocean mermaid, which are the "classic" mermaids everyone knows of. Deep-sea mermaids are pale, have distended jaws, whip-like tails with threads attached to them, and very little hair. Indian ocean mermaids are half the size of Pacific mermaids, have two lace-like fins, and can't swim (instead they use currents to move). Atlantic ocean mermaids are muscular, have a lot of blubber, and wear sealskin cloaks. South Pole mermaids are as small as sea-horses and can only float. It's mentioned that some mermaids, such as Pacific mermaids, only have mouths as vestigial organs and actually filter-feed using their fins.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBridge">The Bridge</a></em>, there are three types of mermaid equivalents in Equestria. Seaponies are the smallest and simplest, resembling oversized seahorses and are ruled by King Leo in Aquestria. Mermares look like a hippocampus with fins for forelimbs, but using the magical charms they wear around their necks they can take on the appearance of a terrestrial equine with a wet mane. They do this to either work above sea level or, given that they are an all-female species, find a mate. Any offspring born from such unions will overwhelmingly be female, Mermares themselves, with any rare sons being the father's species. Most of them used to be nomadic, but those in the Eastern ocean amassed at Mako Island and named the founder of that island the first queen. Since then they have lived under an elected monarchy, with the current ruler being an old friend of Celestia and rival to Luna named Queen Maui. A sirens also resemble hippocampi and were born from the union of three wendigoes forcing themselves upon pair of mermare princesses. They specifically draw power from song magic by inducing certain emotions in people that listen to their singing.

Generations of living there has altered their biology, they grew a tail derived from their sacrum, their legs became flippers and what appears to be red hair on their heads are actually stands of blood-vessel rich tissues that allow them to extract oxygen from the water, not to mention that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">all female</a> and reproduce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">parthenogenically</a>.

<ul><li> Any of the many, many, derivatives of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>" always use "The Little Mermaid Method" of course.
<ul><li> The most famous being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">Disney's</a>, which features a time limitation (three days), a price (like always, her voice), and a clause which means Ariel turns into a polyp if she can't get Eric to kiss her in time. Note that this is all due to Ursula's plot; it's not a limitation of the spell (either that or Triton has more powerful magic).
</li><li> Ursula herself has bluish skin (with the rest of the merfolk showing normal human skin-tones) and an octopus bottom. Even stranger because she was originally meant to be Ariel's <em>aunt</em> in earlier versions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ny72');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ny72" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ny72');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> which is non-canon, but features Disney characters anyway, gives Ursula a backstory — that she <em>used</em> to be a traditional mermaid but used the trident to change her tail to the more familiar octopus bottom.</span> The sequel gives her a sister, Morgana, who also has an octopus design (or maybe squid, since she's skinnier) and grayish skin.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, the mermaids in Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> are of the "dangerously amoral" type, especially for its time. Their shell bras are much more "realistic" than Ariel's, who came later; they're not held on by any straps, they're just sea-creatures attached to the mermaids' chests. One of them is quite obviously only covered by a flower lei, and another by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair">hair</a>. When Wendy meets them, they attack her. When Peter calls them on this, one of them protests, "We were only trying to drown her!" By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid (1989)</a></em> came around, Disney had toned down its mermaids quite a bit, and no one seems to remember the ones from <em>Peter Pan</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em> has an "Underwater Gal" as a scene-stealing minor character.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Onward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Onward">Onward</a></em> shows a few, though none are named or given lines (despite the "kiddie pool" one from the trailer becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>).

Daryl Hannah plays the mermaid in question and much hijinx comes from her trying to pass herself as a human to her love interest (played by Tom Hanks). She transforms whenever her legs get wet.
</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquamarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquamarine">Aquamarine</a></em> follows "The Splash Method" — but see Literature below. She also has to turn back into a mermaid after sunset so she takes up residence in the town's water tower each night. She's also able to grant a wish to any human that helps her.

</li><li> The Made-for-PAX-TV Movie <em>Mermaids</em> (not to be confused with the 1980s Cher vehicle — which has nothing to do with mermaids) features the "Splash Method," with an added complication: the protagonists also turn into mermaids at low tide every night. They're also bound by some kind of natural law to grant wishes for humans. If a human says "I wish" within their presence, they're forced to grant it.
</li><li> The 2003 film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> featured mermaids that look to simply be beautiful half-naked women with fish-tails; you don't notice the claws and the needle-sharp teeth at first.
</li><li> The live-action film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em>, which has Peter Pan revisiting Neverland as an adult, has a brief scene with a trio of mermaids. They appear as half-beautiful woman, half-fish creatures with brightly-colored hair, each giving Peter a kiss to give him air before sending him up to the Lost Boys' camp in a giant oyster.

In addition to becoming able to swim very well and hold his breath underwater for several minutes, the lead character starts to grow scales on his arms, discovers he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl">scale walls</a> thanks to octopus powers, and discovers he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">produce electricity</a> thanks to electric eel heritage.

</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus">Sharktopus</a></em> sequel was originally intended to sic the title creature on a "Merman<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">tula</a>".

Atlantians and Xebelians look like standard humans, while others evolved further when Atlantis fell into the sea: the Fishermen are fish-like humanoids, the citizens of the Kingdom of the Brine evolved to look like crustaceans, and the Trench regressed into what look like violent, animalistic human-anglerfish hybrids. The Kingdom Beyond the Sea and the Desert Kingdom are both long since abandoned, although, given the statues in the latter, the Deserters may have stayed humanoid when Atlantis fell.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>", of course. In the original tale, mermaids lived three hundred years before turning into sea foam; they did not have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">immortal souls</a> and could not acquire one except through marriage to a human, which would give them the right to share in the human destiny. The Sea Witch required her most precious possession — her unusually fine voice — as payment for the transformation spell, since it required the Witch's own blood, and the voice was not refundable; the Sea Witch cut out her tongue. The transformation was <em>very</em> painful, as though she had been cut with a sword, and she was warned up front that forever afterward, every step she took would feel as though she were treading on knives. She was also warned that if the prince married someone else, her heart would break and she would turn to sea foam just as if she had lived out her full three hundred years. At the VERY end, the mermaid who wanted a soul dies and becomes an air spirit who can earn a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">soul</a> by 100 years of good deeds — with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> remark that an air spirit's time may be reduced if she sees well-behaved children who make her smile, or increased if she sees wicked children who make her weep. As the sea witch in this version isn't evil, she does provide a reversal to the spell: a knife that the mermaid can kill the prince with to regain her tail. The price for that is much cheaper: all of her sisters' hair.
</li><li> Before the Little Mermaid, there was the novella <em>Undine</em> (1811) by German romantic writer Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqué, which was a great literary success all over Europe and in North America (it is, for instance, mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em>). The story, which is based on the writings of Paracelsus and the French folk-tale of Mélusine, bears a strong resemblance to Andersen's fairy tale, but there are important differences. Undine, who has no difficulty changing to human form, is raised by a fisherman and his wife, and falls in love with the knight Huldbrand. As Undine's uncle Kühleborn ("cool spring") tells her, she could gain herself a soul if she married him. But she has a rival in the fair but haughty lady Bertalda <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who, it later turns out, is actually the biological daughter of Undine's foster parents, which leads to Undine being torn between her love for Huldbrand and her wish to be friends with Bertalda</span>. Undine does marry Huldbrand, but then a three-sided argument leads to Huldbrand wishing she should return to her aquatic family. Undine now has to leave and later, when Huldbrand marries Bertalda, is forced to kill him with a kiss. Huldbrand is buried and Undine turns into a spring next to his grave. Fouqué adapted the story into an opera scored by his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann">E. T. A. Hoffmann</a>, two other opera adaptations were written by Albert Lortzing (1845) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a> (1869).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Halvgudene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Halvgudene">Halvgudene</a></em> is a quite weird example. They have both women and men, that are all siblings and they vote forth their new leader which they call Mother or Father based on their gender. They are are a little more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Fish People</a> due to having gills on their necks and have fish-like eyes.
</li><li> Donna Jo Napoli's novel <em>Sirena</em> portrays mermaids in the traditional beautiful, sailor-seducing manner but adds a few details. Her mermaids (and their ocean-dwelling brothers mermen) are the product of the god Eros having sex with a tropical fish. They become immortal if they mate with humans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandOfTheAunts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandOfTheAunts">Island of the Aunts</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaIbbotson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaIbbotson">Eva Ibbotson</a>, the standard mermaids are pretty standard, with the difference that they're not supernaturally beautiful. Of the three merpeople on the island, one is a visibly old woman, one is a standard mermaid, and the latters' baby son is so fat that he looks like a beach ball if you don't look closely. They were thrown out of their home by the young mermaid's husband, who fell head over heels for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLooksSexierIfFrench">french mermaid, who had two tails.</a>
</li><li> In the <em>Ingo</em> Young Adult books by Helen Dunmore, the Mer (<strong>don't</strong> call them Mermaids, Mermen, or Merfolk) are described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals">half-human, half-seal</a>. They can't become human but humans can become Mer apparently. They don't like humans very much, except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half Human Hybrids</a> with whom they can communicate.
</li><li> In <em>Four Kids, Three Cats, Two Cows, One Witch (Maybe)</em> Kevin tells Beverly a story about a family of merpeople where the father gets fed up of being neglected by his family and leaves to marry a human woman. He loses his tail because of this but is able to regain it at night time.
</li><li> The original, printed page <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aquamarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aquamarine">Aquamarine</a></em>, by Alice Hoffman, centers around a Mermaid who is stranded in a swimming pool after a storm. She's a bit self-centered, but eventually realises she will need the help of the only humans who know about her if she is ever to return home and to her sisters. She cannot transform into a human <em>at all</em>. The rescue actually takes some time and effort — enough time for Aquamarine to develop a crush on a human man...
</li><li> There's also Indigo, also by Helen Dunmore, which is about two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> boys, who have webbing between their fingers and toes, can hold their breath for a very long time, drink salt water, love eating fish, and constantly daydream about the ocean. Their mother was a traditional mermaid with a tail instead of legs, however.
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmilyWindsnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmilyWindsnap">Emily Windsnap</a> books also use "The Splash Method". A "semi-mer", with one mermaid and one human parent, can become a mermaid when totally immersed in water, and will become human again when not, wet or dry; they can even take showers and baths, evidenced by the protagonist, who didn't learn she was a mermaid until taking a swimming class at the age of 13. Full mermaids are permanently mermaids and cannot even become a human by use of magic.
<ul><li> It's also worth mentioning they have pockets in their tails.
</li></ul></li><li> The mermaid in the poem "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFigurehead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFigurehead">The Figurehead</a>" is the daughter of none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NauticalFolklore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NauticalFolklore">Davy Jones</a>. And she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> about it; not exactly evil, but selfish and indifferent to the core. Like the sirens of mythology, her domain is littered with wrecks and bones, from which she's fashioned her home.
</li><li> MaryJanice Davidsons' <em>Fred the Mermaid</em> erotica/paranormal romance has Fredericka Bimm as a lead character. She and the other mermaids in the series can simply become human at will. Even their human form is much faster and stronger than a normal human and they are all telepathic except for Frederika who is only telepathic underwater.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> merpeople appear during the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry and the other Champions have to visit their village in the school's lake. The merpeople Harry meets are rather ugly by human standards, with gray skin, green hair and yellow teeth and eyes. The spin-off media book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> mentions that there are at least three kind of mermaids—the Scottish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals">selkies</a> that Harry sees, the Irish merrow and the warm-water <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids">sirens</a>—and that the latter apparently fit the more traditional, "beautiful" model.
</li><li> You don't get much more different than Feejee the Mermaid (heh) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU">Tales of MU</a></em>. She can change at will between <strong>three</strong> forms: standard lady-half/fishie-half mermaid, an intermediate form with a distinctly humanoid lower half covered in scales, and fully human-like. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She can also assume a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">fighting form</a> by growing scale-armor all over her body and claws on her hands. It's implied she can also change her face to a... less appealing form.</span> Oh, and she <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eats people</a></em>.
<ul><li> In fact, it's fairly strongly implied that merfolk in that universe basically <em>are</em> intelligent predatory fish with the magical ability to take on shapes more appealing to humanoids as a lure! They even have a myth about their goddess inspiring the land-dwellers to build ships <em>for the express purpose of providing them with food</em>...
</li><li> Shapeshifting allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Feegee</a> to overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">Mermaid Problem</a> with her boyfriend, though only for recreation. Mermaids actually reproduce in a more fishy way. They spawn.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s enigmatic <em>Deep Ones</em> are supposed to be the truth-behind-the-myth of mermaids. They're immortal, extremely unattractive... and they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiochemicalBarriers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiochemicalBarriers">mate with humans</a>. The offspring are born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">effectively human</a>, but undergo a slow metamorphosis.
<ul><li> Minor note: The capacity for interbreeding is Handwaved by Lovecraft as "all life has a common descent," never mind the fact humans can't even breed with the closet-related thing, chimps.
</li><li> Humans are willing to do this for <em>huge</em> amounts of gold, sharing of knowledge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>, and because the offspring never grow old (Carrying on my family by making immortal kids? I'll put a bag over her head!)
<ul><li> Worth noting as well that this is something of a bait and switch deal. The humans are given treasures and powers in exchange for minor deeds up until the Deep Ones are sure that their chosen human is completely dependent on them, then comes the proposition.
</li><li> Deep One hybrids can retain their human appearance for decades before undergoing the transformation, long enough for themselves to interbreed with humans and pass along the Deep One gene.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSBeagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSBeagle">Peter S.

It makes him rich, but then it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a small number of those who drink it become transformed into mer-creatures themselves</span>. Here, mermaids are portrayed as wild and inhuman, and they range from supernaturally hideous to supernaturally beautiful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars">Emerald Sea</a></em> features mermen and mermaids created by genetic engineering. They look like traditional merfolk but have a unique physiology combining fish and dolphin traits. They also find it hard to survive in the ocean after the loss of technology reduces them to a stone-age hunter-gatherer society.
</li><li> Another very differentthough friendliervariation are Vonda McIntyre's "divers", who appear in several of her works. Imagine people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelkiesAndWereseals">with some sea-lion-like traits</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">engineered</a> in, plus lungs modified for use in either air or water. That's the short description. (They're also usually described as attractive...and decidedly <em>not</em> subject to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">Mermaid Problem</a>.)
<ul><li> McIntyre's historical fantasy novel <em>The Moon and the Sun</em> has the sea people, who have hind limbs adapted for swimming instead of fish tails, as well as webbed fingers and claws. They also have an anatomical adaptation (just like that of the divers, only they come by it naturally rather than being genetically engineered) that allows them to breathe water as well as air. And their language consists of songs.
</li></ul></li><li> Piers Anthony's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> series does the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a> route, while his standalone book <em>Mercycle</em> uses genetically modified descendants of normal humans, in whom the structure of human legs (complete with * ahem* equipment) is hidden within the tail.
<ul><li> Thea, in <em>Mute</em>, is a mutant with legs fused from the knee down and flipperlike feet. And yes, she averts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">Mermaid Problem</a> quite handily.
</li></ul></li><li> The post-apocalyptic mermaids in Alida Van Gores' <em>Mermaid's Song</em> come in two varieties: Mirra (traditional) and Mog <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">(more fish-like)</a>. The Mirra have dolphin-like tails (and reproductive organs) and constitute an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">oppressed minority.</a> Unusually, neither species can transform, since humans appear to be extinct and the surface world doesn't figure into the story much at all.

<ul><li> The Grindylow from the same novel are much less friendly mermen.
</li></ul></li><li> In Kai Meyer's first installment of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkReflectionsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkReflectionsTrilogy">Dark Reflections Trilogy</a></em>, <em>The Water Mirror</em>, the mermaids who inhabit Venice appear to be normal-looking women with fish tails- until you notice that their mouths are larger, longer, and filled with very sharp teeth. They are sentient but are considered bestial by the Venetians, who use them to pull their gondolas and occasionally eat them. They cannot assume human form through magical means, but one mermaid lives as a human thanks to surgically-created legs and a mask covering the lower half of her face.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulJennings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulJennings">Paul Jennings</a>'s short story <em>Nails</em>, merfolk can interbreed with humans, but the offspring look perfectly human up until their teens. Then their fingernails and toenails start to apparently multiply... these are actually developing scales, and when the process is complete, the hybrid has become a new merperson, legs fusing together into a tail which, like their arms, is covered in scales.
<ul><li> To be more exact, the mermen have legs but are covered in scales up to their necks while mermaids are just traditional merfolk, so only a female half-breed's legs would fuse.
</li></ul></li><li> K?b? Abe's short story <em>Ningyoden</em> (Mermaid Legend) is about a man falling in love with a flesh-eating mermaid. There's also some cloning involved.

Sprague de Camp</a> features mermaids in several fantasy stories. In all of them (even ones in different continuities) the mermaids are part dolphin, rather than part fish. They are also streamlined for swimming, so the females breasts are generally smaller than those typically portrayed in mermaid art. The mermaids are fairly friendly: in one story ("Nothing in the Rules") one is even paid to enter a swim meet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> series there are two varieties.

These could live in and out of water, though no further description of any kind is given. The artist for the early editions draws them as typical mermaids and merman as beautiful humans with bare chests, green tails, and blonde hair.

Their skin is the color of "old ivory"and they have dark purple hair. Lucy mistakes them to be just like those they met before, but Edmund points out that these Sea People seem unable to leave the water, even for a short time, otherwise the Sea People would have attacked the two of them. Therefore they presumably looked at least somewhat alike. These Sea People rode giant Sea-Horses, wielded spears, and used hunting fish to hunt other fish for sport. The ones they saw had some sort of orange or emerald streamer from their shoulders, wore different kinds of coronets (some with gold) and some wore chains of pearls, but no other clothes. They had a large castle or city a top an underwater mountain, for, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> points out from the point of view of underwater people, mountains and valleys' characteristics are reversed — mountains are the warm civilised areas near the surface, valleys are the mysterious dark areas populated by monsters.

</li><li> Sarah Porter's <em>Lost Voices</em> Trilogy has a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">dark and unique</a> take on mermaids. Certain young human girls have the potential to come back as mermaids, if they suffered severe abuse or neglect in their human lives. They are reborn as beautiful mermaids with fish tails and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthrallingSiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthrallingSiren">enchanting</a> voices that can entrance or madden humans — though the talent is actually pretty rare considering. These mermaids are ageless, though not completely immortal, and all still traumatized from what they endured in life. They also act a bit like water mammals — they do breath air, but they can hold it for a very long time underwater. They sink ships and drown people as revenge against all of humanity for what was done to them by parents/caretakers and other people in their previous lives — this is also implied to be something like an instinct. They form tribes in the oceans (this is for survival, as they can still be killed by humans, sharks, etc. and still need to eat, though they can survive on raw shellfish) and have strict laws against having any contact with humans other than singing them to their doom. Once transformed, they can't survive out of the water for long, and if trapped on dry land, they will revert to human form and then die (a very painful process). It is implied that certain young men and boys have the same kind of potential if badly treated in life, but attempts to transform them are usually unsuccessful.

They are the daughters of Nereus, the Old Man of the Sea who has the octopus bottom but they all have fish tails. Josh notes that some are beautiful women while others resemble fish and crabs. They all have green skin and sharp teeth and claws (hint: they're not on the side of good) as well as having apparent powers through singing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Virginia Dare</span> is attacked by one and claims to have stolen her voice, leaving her mute and then implies Nereus will "dispose of her" since she is useless to him now.

In mermaid form, a silver ring is visible around their neck. Other abilities include generating electricity (which can be governed by emotions), telepathy with fish, and a telepathic bond with others in their family while in mermaid form, which can only be severed by the head of their family. Mermaids are instinctively drawn to others in the link, and it makes it very hard for a mermaid (or merman) to strike out on their own, though some with stronger wills are capable of doing so. They age at a rate of one year for every three that go by. Mermaids are unable to break a promise once made, and react VERY badly to humans who do so.
<ul><li> Feeding-wise, <em>Lies Beneath</em> mermaids can eat normal food, but are drawn to humans whose auras shine with positive emotions, absorbing them directly from the human, leaving them as dried-out husks and providing the mermaid with a brief reprieve from their natural bleakness. They are predators, and act like them.
</li><li> Reproduction is done in two ways: first, directly with humans while in human form. After the birth, the infant is left with the father until they learn to walk, at which point they are returned to the mother, and live as a mermaid full-time. The other, less common way is known as "reinvigoration", in which a human drowns and has their heart restarted via the mermaid's electric shock. This method fully converts the human into a mermaid, and bonds them to their new family. It is a very rare event, but can be done, usually by a mermaid who had drowned a victim and had second thoughts.

Rani, the protagonist, is a magical mermaid who was adopted by normal merfolk when she was a baby.

It's also noted that, like certain species of tropical fish, merpeople can change sex to explain why females are more common than males.

They also have powers over water: one can freeze it at will, one can boil it at will, and the other controls it at will (also she can multiply it from a drop to a bucket). Congruent with their origin, the full moon can have weird effects on them if they see it (what effects depends on planetary alignments), and in one case, permanently increase their powers. They can swim quite fast. They cannot breathe underwater, but can comfortably hold their breath for inhumanly long periods.

They can also focus their powers through "moon rings" (which seem similar to a rock the main characters encounter in the first show) to access a much wider and stronger power set. Mermen also exist, but live among humans due to an ancient war across gender lines. The obvious reproductive questions go unaddressed, but given that the mermaids seen on the show were hatched long after the war, and they avoid humans like the plague, they clearly reproduce without male help.

In addition to the traditional mermaid/man, you also have random aquatic species, and the Amphibs, human mutants who range in appearance from Black Lagoon-like to Fish-headed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em> has the Kithain Merfolk and the Thallain Murdhuacha (pronounced <em>mer-RU-ka</em>). The Merfolk are what one generally thinks about when one thinks mermaid: their lower halves are of various bony fish (except for House Melsinee, who instead take the form of air-breathing marine mammals and reptiles). The Murdhuacha are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">merged with crustaceans, mollusks, and other seagoing invertebrates</a>. When either kith takes to land, their lower halves automatically turn into legs — the Merfolk resemble Sidhe with their otherworldly beauty, while the Murdhuacha are disturbing enough they can momentarily freeze people in their tracks.
<ul><li> There's also a bit of horror, as the Merfolk and Murdhuacha are trying to fight off the game's constantly-oppressive force of Banality. Any changeling who succumbs to Banality loses all access to their fae abilities and forgets all about their second life. Imagine being one of them, and coming to in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean... about five hundred feet down.
</li><li> The French-language <em>Le Monde des Tenebres: France</em> has the Morganed kith, who are similar but not identical to the mer: they're able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids">draw humans to them with their songs</a>, and need to spend time in salt water every day or lose Glamour. They associate themselves with land-dwellers more than the isolationist Merfolk do, aligning themselves with the overland courts of the Sidhe rather than the undersea courts of the Merfolk. Thanks to a Kickstarter stretch goal, they got included in the 20th anniversary corebook for <em>Dreaming</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> variant, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, has the Swimmerskin type of Changeling. They can breathe underwater with a point of Glamour (their "mana", powered by emotions), but cannot breathe air unless they spend another point of Glamour or let the first power expire. There's also an Elemental version, but those aren't Merfolk.

In term of appearance and personalities, they are as varied as any human can be, and can be based on pretty much any aquatic life form, be monstrous or beautiful, aggressive or nice. They all have the ability to switch between two forms: a human one, which allows them to go around among humans and live out of water, and a Diluvian form, which possesses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaturalWeapon">Natural Weapons</a> and is much more powerful, but only truly effective when underwater.

They typically keep to themselves and avoid contact with other races, whether terrestrial or aquatic, and tend to attack intruders in their territories. They're also one of the numerous species engineered as slaves, servants and agents by the aboleths, who refer to them as sapiaquali-oths, and these are the only species that the merfolk consider to be their allies.

In mermaids, both sexes possess pronounced breasts. Merrows come in both salt- and freshwater varieties. Both species are found worldwide in warm and temperate seas, and mermaids are both highly tolerant of and dependent on pollution — like several other Sixth World species, they reacted to rampant environmental degradation by becoming so well-adapted to it as to be unable to survive without it. In mermaids' case, they're entirely unable to survive without a constant intake of mercury in their diets.

They also rule the world as there are no humans in this world, and they do so with fancy weapon tricks and powerful magic.

</li><li> In one Animaniacs's episode of Buttons and Mindy, Mindy and her mother are mermaids, while Buttons is a merdog.

("Horrifying but true!") He wound up stuck in Gravity Falls' community pool and can't leave without suffocating. Eventually Mabel and Dipper help him get back to the sea, and in a later episode we find out that he's had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with a manatee princess.

They also have the apparent ability to temporarily transform any land dogs into Mer-Pups, as seen with the mother who turns Zuma and Skye into Mer-Pups to get their help in rescuing her trapped child.

(Or in Salem's case, a half-feline "cat-fish.") Annoyingly, they have to be back on that beach in an hour or they can't teleport back, but staying on land for more than a few minutes dehydrates them, so a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> ensues.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em>: Throughout the franchise's history, the role of mermaids has generally been taken by the seaponies and similar creatures. Depending on the generation, these tend to be based on either seahorses or hippocampi.

<ul><li> The picture book <em>Under The Sparkling Sea</em>, which takes place mostly in the underwater kingdom of Aquastria, features G1-style seaponies resembling colorful, banded seahorses with large, transparent fins. There are also mermares, a more direct take on mermaids, with full fish tails and smaller fins.
</li><li> One of the comics featured a kelpie, a pony-like creature with hypnotic singing powers.
</li><li> In terms of the actual cartoon, the first such creatures to appear were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirensAreMermaids">Sirens</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsRainbowRocks">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Rainbow Rocks</a></em>. These are a trio of creatures resembling enormous, scaled, fanged ponies with fish tails, large dorsal fins and smaller fins along their legs. They can use their songs to control the minds of others, which they do in order to sow hatred and distrust that they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">feed on</a>.

</li><li> Ripjaws from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> definitely has a Mermaid-like tail when he's underwater throughout the series. His tail can "retract" to form legs on land, with the tail becoming a sort of "loincloth".

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wishfart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wishfart">Wishfart</a></em>, almost every character is a different type of fantastical being, so naturally, the love interest of our protagonist Dez (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun">Leprechaun</a>) is a blue-haired mermaid named Tsuni. She can breathe both air and water but usually moves about on land by using a skateboard. However, her singing voice is absolutely horrible and rather than hypnotizing men, instead awakens krakens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPussInBoots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPussInBoots">The Adventures of Puss in Boots</a></em>: In "Mermaid", Puss attempts to prove that he is a ladies man by rescuing a mermaid with a beautiful signing voice. However, although beautiful from behind, she turns out to be a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace">Butter Face</a>, and while her singing voice is angelic, her speaking voice is an irritating screech like nails down a blackboard. And she insists on accompanying Puss everywhere. Her name (Feejee) and appearance are based on the famous 'Fiji Mermaid' hoax: the torso of a monkey stitched on to the tail of a fish.

While Mira isn't one, she has mermaid-like powers, which include breathing underwater, communicating with animals and fishes and swimming excellently. Kai lampshades this at one point.

At one point, Darwin gets a card that says "Inverted Mermaid". Nothing happens, because he's already a fish with legs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans">The Backyardigans</a></em> episode "Viking Voyage" has Tasha the hippo as an evil mermaid who wants to prove how much tougher she is than the other Backyardigans (who are playing Vikings). She captures the Vikings and forces them to sing to her forever, which might have worked if they hadn't sung her to sleep with a lullaby.

Spending too much time in the water without returning to the surface will eventually cause them to shift into mindless fish monsters, though they'll revert to normal if they go back on land.

</li><li> P.T. Barnum's museum of curiosities featured a twisted, mummified specimen called a "Fiji Mermaid". It was, of course, a fake, created by sewing the front half of a monkey to the back half of a fish. It was also every bit as f'ugly as that combination sounds.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis">Robin Jarvis</a> evidently took inspiration from it for the mummified mer-thing in <em>The Whitby Child</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> One popular hypothesis as to the source of the mermaid myth is that manatees, dugongs and sea cows were often mistaken for mermaids, perhaps because the females have breasts and float upright in the water to nurse their young. Taxonomists recognized this by assigning these species the order name <em>Sirenia</em>
<ul><li> There's a wonderful bit in one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s logs about seeing "mermaids" in the Caribbean — he says they're less beautiful than they are painted, because their face resembles that of a man. A seriously ugly man, one assumes.

Barney theorizes that sailors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatOVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatOVision">saw manatees as beautiful women</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornySailors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornySailors">they have not seen real women for so long</a>. He adds that this is why men and women can't just be friends: eventually the "manatee" turns into a mermaid.

They may appear friendly, but they can also be malicious. However foreign depictions of mermaids such as in Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid (1989)</a></em> are still popular because, after all, Their Mermaids Are Different.
</li><li> An extremely rare human birth defect, in which both legs are fused together from crotch to feet, is known as sirenomelia or "mermaid syndrome". Sadly, people with this condition usually die within a day of birth, due to associated abnormalities of kidneys and bladder; to date, only a handful of sirenomelia patients have survived for long, and only with drastic surgical help.
</li><li> The <em>Annals of the Four Masters</em> (a collection of medieval Irish histories compiled in the early 17th century) casually mention mermaids being caught several times. Most impressive is a mermaid listed as having washed ashore in the year 887:
<div class="indent"><em>One hundred and ninety five feet was her length, eighteen feet was the length of her hair, seven feet was the length of the fingers of her hand, seven feet also was the length of her nose; she was whiter than the swan all over.</em>
</div></li><li> Bethany Hamilton of the surfing movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoulSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoulSurfer">Soul Surfer</a></em>, at least once compared herself and Alana Blanchard to mermaids.

A small subculture centered around mermaiding has gained some popularity with swimmers in recent years.
</li><li> There are a number of people — usually women — who work as professional mermaids. They're hired to perform at aquariums in costume as children's entertainment, often to teach something about marine biology too.
