Most of them are like driving laws: they enhance safety and help keep things organized. But once you know <em>why</em> those rules exist, it's possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">break them safely</a>, without causing any crashes and maybe even <em>avoiding</em> them. But that takes work and practice; if you can't get it right when you do it correctly, you <em>sure</em> can't get it right when you do it incorrectly. So, kids: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>.
</p><p>Please try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">avoid</a> sounding like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">Grammar Nazi</a> when adding examples. Remember also, for the purpose of keeping oneself sane, that language, especially English, changes throughout time. What you think is a mistake may soon become so common that it is the norm, and in twenty years your descendants will be correcting you for doing it the old way. Try not to slap them for it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fi11');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fi11" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fi11');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One could also make an argument that the English language, strictly speaking, <em>has</em> no right or wrong way to write anything. Unlike almost all other major languages (such as French or Mandarin or German), English has no language institute to dictate the correct way of using it, meaning that its rules are more akin to social etiquette than to actual laws  that is, the rules of the English language aren't imperatives, on the order of "don't kill people for fun", but, rather, suggestions on the order of "don't pick your nose in public".</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Over-Punctuation </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As shown in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> quote, found at the top of the page, the overpresence, or abundance, one might say, of commas is a phenomenon which, to some, can, seemingly, cause frustration.
<ul><li> Sentences, like the one above, where every comma has a defensible, albeit overly fussy, reason for being there, are less aggravating, than sentences, where commas, are just thrown, in, wherever the speaker might pause, to take a breath.
<ul><li> There's <em>some</em> logic behind using punctuation, to indicate pauses, because that's what they were invented for. The first punctuation marks, were seen in Greek plays, and indicated, where the actor should insert, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticEllipsis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticEllipsis">Dramatic Ellipsis</a>, with the mark itself, denoting the length, of, the pause. Having said that, it's no longer the time of Christ, so try not to punctuate, as if it were.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Some writers like to use ellipses in place of commas which... besides being infuriating to those who understand the proper use of the ellipsis... makes it look like the writer is either leaving out a lot or just struggling to think of a way to end the sentence (or is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>...Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken">Christopher Walken</a>). In addition.... the number of periods used in said ellipses tends to vary wildly..... anywhere from the standard three (or four at the end of a sentence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">to be overly technical</a>)................................................................. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">to infinity and beyond</a>.
</li><li> Exclamation points do not stack!!! Not even when you're writing out dialogue for <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed">BRIAN BLESSED</a></strong>!
<ul><li> Nor are exclamation points to be used when someone is speaking calmly. For some reason, people like to put an exclamation point at the end of a quote where the original delivery was entirely deadpan. Some kids' comics tend to use them, though, probably for emphasis.
<ul><li> In many languages exclamation marks are used a lot as a mark of imperative: "Go to your room!" often gets an exclamation mark even if it isn't shouted. This doesn't mean it <em>has</em> to: "Go to your room" is still perfectly valid.
</li><li> Once in a while, amazing as it sounds, there is a reason for this. In old comic books the printing was so shoddy that an isolated dot could easily be left out, so many classic comics end every single sentence with an exclamation mark just to make sure there would be something.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">"And all those exclamation marks, you notice? Five? A sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head."</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Did you know that question marks don't stack, either?? Are you aware that several question marks at the end of a statement aren't needed to make people know how confused you are about something???? One is enough, you know???????? Do you see how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">redundant</a> this is????????????????
<ul><li> Two question marks may be acceptable to some, to convey a certain tone of confusion and incredulity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> annotations often use them to indicate major tactical blunders.
</li><li> For question marks and exclamation marks, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Rule of Three</a> seems to be in effect. You can, mainly because of convention, get away with maybe three exclamation points, but this is usually the limit. And it would be typically for a loud shout or scream (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>). You hardly ever see two exclamation marks, just one or three, and you hardly ever see more than one question mark except to denote complete confusion.
</li></ul></li><li> Use of "quotation marks" for "emphasis," which make readers think you're being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirQuotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirQuotes">sarcastic</a>."
<ul><li> Often happens by accident on this very wiki, when editors get the ''italics markup'' wrong.
</li><li> Also using "quotation" marks to "isolate" any word that might be seen as "racy" or "unusual" or is in the "slightest bit of doubt." Reading text like this is infinitely more fun if you do "finger quotes" every time it comes up.
<ul><li> The technical term is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes">scare quotes,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> referring to the idea that the author is scared of the term and wants to distance himself from it, or wants to scare the viewer with it.
</li><li> Scare quotes are unfairly named, as they do have some legitimate uses. They can express subtle irony when used correctly. They're also used in academic or formal writing to introduce an important term or phrase that the author believes will be unfamiliar to readers.
</li></ul></li><li> Furthermore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">technically</a>, punctuation should only go inside the quotation marks when quoting the sentence, and not just for "a few words". Quotations for "emphasis" usually fall "under this". "Do you see what I'm saying?"
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Behold thy savior: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/">The "Blog" of "Unnecessary" Quotation Marks!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This is actually correct in Japanese (well, they use corner brackets (「...」) instead of quotation marks ("..."), but it's the same concept). However, that doesn't mean you can leave it when translating a manga, since then you'll make the dialogue sound funny.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Superfluous_apostrophes_(%22greengrocers_apostrophes%22)">Greengrocers Apostrophe's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: the use of an apostrophe to tell people whether the "s" on the end of the word is a plural or part of the word. So now you know the fruit/vegetable is called a <em>banana</em> (plural bananas) and not a <em>bananas</em> (plural presumably bananases), although you'd think context would have make it clear a greengrocer would not be selling a single "bananas". Interestingly, unlike other example's, this used to be acceptable but fell out of fashion.
<ul><li> For some reason this error is particularly common in Japan. Thus video games have received titles such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Y's</a>,</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zcna');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1zcna" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zcna');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> version, fortunately</span> <em>8 Eye's</em>, <em>Pig's and Bomber's</em>, <em>Ninja Master's</em> and <em>Steam Heart's</em>. While the title of <em>Ninja Princess</em> is free of such spurious apostrophes, its beginning screen does say "Princess'es Adventure Starts."
</li><li> The erroneous apostrophe-s ending is also quite common in Swedish (but found chiefly on signs put up by small businesses, so greengrocers indeed). This is mostly understood as an anglicism, since the Swedish language normally doesn't use apostrophes to indicate possessives.
</li><li> There used to be a hairdresser's shop in Wautoma, Wisconsin named "Hi's and Her's Hair Salon".
</li><li> Also, the 3rd person present singular form of a verb should not have an apostrophe. It should be "Bob reads a book", not "Bob read's a book".
</li><li> In Norwegian, the erroneous apostrophe-s ending is not unusual. In Norwegian, the genitive is formed by adding an -s, but <em>not</em> an apostrophe (unless the word ends in -s, -x, or -z, in which case you only add an apostrophe and not an -s).
</li><li> There is at least one minicab company going by the name of "1'st Taxis"
</li><li> Note that the rules are less clear for the plural forms of <em>letters</em>. Some recommend always using an apostrophe, others only for lowercase letters ("Dikkens with two Ks, but mind your p's and q's").
</li></ul></li><li> The use of + to mean "and". This is only acceptable <em>in handwriting</em>, where many people substitute a plus sign for the ampersand on the understandable grounds that "&amp;" is hard to write. But seriously, if you're on a keyboard, you've got the "&amp;" right there. Why would you use a "+"? In Boolean algebra, "+" is actually used for the "or" operator.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0icwf');"><sup>For those unclear on the last bit </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0icwf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0icwf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Boolean is essentially binary that ignores all but the last digit, true = 1, and false = 0. So '+' is an "exclusive" or, since false + false = false, true + true = false, and true + false = true. There is a separate operation for the "inclusive" or where both things being compared being true also makes the statement true. If you want to be confused again, look up the symbology used by circuit designers, which inverts this again (+ becomes inclusive or and a Celtic cross is used for exclusive).</span>

<div class="indent">— Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.

You've never heard of the interrobang‽ I'm not surprised. It's non-standard. But if you insist on writing incredulous statements that require both and aren't willing to compromise on one or the other, you should probably get to know U+203D.
</li><li> Contractions using apostrophes to join words, then ultimately losing them, is a standard evolutionary form in the English language. Yet, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllHallowsEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllHallowsEve">Halloween</a>" has recently seen a trend of people putting the apostrophe back in and spelling it "Hallowe'en". Part of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> (it looks appropriately archaic and spooky), but there also seems to be a mistaken belief that Halloween's apostrophe only disappeared in the last few decades (Wrong. The Oxford English Dictionary dates "Halloween" to 1786). In fact, "Hallowe'en" isn't even the original contracted form of All Hallows' Evening (which was Hallow-e'en). For comparison, see "God be with ye" becoming "good-b'ye"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rp67');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rp67" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rp67');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which stuck around for much of the 1800s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> used it</span> and then finally "goodbye", yet you don't see anyone putting the apostrophe back in there.

<ul><li> Overuse of commas is bad but to some readers nothing drives them up the wall quite like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPunctuationPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPunctuationPeriod">no commas whatsoever</a> because it sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">the author is speaking without pause going on and on and on and on</a> giving no hint of when a pause in speech is happening and destroying what logical flow exists in the text making it impossible to follow let alone read out loud. (And given the reasons behind punctuation's invention as detailed above we tropers are not smoking something by claiming their lack is the same as a lack of pauses.)
<ul><li> The non-use of commas in favor of "or" in a list of things such as shopping or tools or books or animals or foods or games or other things is also annoying.
</li><li> The perfect example of the importance of commas: compare "No, don't stop!" with "No, don't, stop!" Another example: "Let's eat, Grandma!" versus "Let's eat Grandma!"
</li><li> As with any rule, underuse of commas can still be done right. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></em> is notorious for its lack of them, and considering that Fitzgerald spent hours choosing individual words, it's unlikely that he left any commas out by accident.
<ul><li> Although he did make a few errors in his word choice (referring to the retina as a visible part of the eye, for example), so it's still possible.
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes, the lack of commas is acceptable in a form of media, often to make the author sound like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a>.
</li><li> However adverbials at the start of sentences are often mistaken for conjunctions, leading to the omission of a necessary comma. In even worse cases longer phrases which are clearly not conjunctions will lack commas as well.
</li><li> Some writers have formed the mistaken idea that "and" should never be preceded by a comma. A comma marks a pause, and often helps to clarify the overall sentence structure. In particular, it's often necessary when a sentence contains both an "and" conjoining two nouns and an "and" conjoining two clauses. For example: "Today I will wash my house and my car, and book a flight." Without the comma, the reader is momentarily misled into including "book" as one of the things washed. The following words immediately clarify, but why cause the reader any problem at all when it's so easily avoided?
<ul><li> Technically the rule is that a comma before the "and" marks the end of the clause. Therefore if the sentence only has one subject, you do not use the comma before the "and." So the above sentence should actually be "A comma marks a pause and often helps to clarify the overall sentence structure." This is because "comma" is the only subject. The "and" is simply denoting two separate verbs. And while I'm on it, "a comma marks a pause" is not quite accurate. You can't just pepper in commas when you want someone to pause. You need a grammar rule to back up your usage, such as marking the end of a clause.
</li><li> A good way of teaching this is to show how lists of words function with the addition of paired words. "Ambrosia and Nevras, Anideshi and Azrael, Yazim Jianne, Aqorm, Elias, and Michael set next to Lilith at the table in the wedding." In this sentence, the ones that are couples are paired, while the ones that bachelors or in unsteady relationships are not. You might also pair ham and eggs together on a breakfast listing if they are mixed together in a scramble, along with toast and jam, while milk, and juice as separate items.
</li><li> A better example for when to use the Oxford Comma (the comma that precedes "and", especially in the last item of a list): "This book is dedicated to my parents, Charlie Chaplin<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">,</span> and Groucho Marx".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Another one often found on the Internet is lack of question marks when appropriate. It can be useful for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">asking questions flatly</a>, but otherwise, why on Earth do people do this.

<ul><li> Standard keyboard layouts in mind, ideally, people should become aware that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus">there are distinct characters for hyphens, dashes, and the minus sign.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Would you bet on people never considering it bothersome?
<ul><li> To a typographer the above are hyphens, En dashes, and Em dashes (what you are calling a minus sign is an En dash). The difference is the length of the line. Sadly, most keyboards just use the same thing for all, and typographers must dive into a font's glyphs to get the appropriate one.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> People who don't close their parentheses (this is very annoying.
<ul><li> And also, people using parentheses inside parentheses. Besides the fact it is considered bad style (you shouldn't use more than one set (otherwise it can get really confusing (by disturbing the flow of the text) to the reader (forcing him to backtrack again and again)) inside a sentence), when having to do so you should use different punctuation (parenthesis first [then square brackets {then curly brackets (and only then back to parentheses [and so on {<em>ad infinitum</em>}])}]) for the secondary, tertiary, and higher-order interruptions inside the parentheses, as to make it easier to know which phrase is being closed. (Not a hard rule, but it really makes comprehension easier.)
<ul><li> The switching parenthesis type rule probably originates in typesetting practices for mathematical formulae, but there is was primarily a substitute for larger parenthesis sizes, and is now essentially obsolete (although practice varies between different branches of mathematics, with switching being more common close to physics). Brackets for a parenthesis <em>can</em> be justified as a way of stressing that what they surround constitutes a natural whole. Braces for a parenthesis are almost never seen except in some fixed notation involving Laplace (and the like) transforms, since their main interpretation nowadays would be that of denoting the set of what the braces surround.
</li><li> Just be sure to nest them properly (the parentheses [unless you want to confuse someone) like computer programmers].
</li><li> Computer programmers are used to using several parentheses nested inside one another, and sometimes find it annoying when the type of parentheses switch, because different parentheses mean different things! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">Like { methods returning (various things from array_entries[21]);} </a>
</li><li> Switching type of parenthesis can be just as wrong in natural language. In a quote, square brackets usually delimit remarks [<em>sic</em>!] or edits by the quoting author, so if nested parentheses are turned into brackets then the result could get very hard to quote properly.
</li><li> And God forbid it when someone both uses parentheses within parentheses <em>and</em> doesn't close them. (Honestly, this is the most annoying thing ever. (This is bad enough on places like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> (Less forgivable on conversation-based sites like forums.)
</li><li> Most style guides forbid the use of nested parentheses except in the case of symbolic use (such as math equations or programming examples). If you really must break into a parenthetical note with another, internally separated idea (which is almost never strictly necessary — though it can be useful for certain stylistic purposes), the correct method is to either use an em-dash or restructure the whole sentence to avoid the problem entirely.
</li><li> The general term for all these kinds of punctuation is <em>brackets</em>. The terms for the various kinds differ, often along the lines of American and British English: () = AE: parentheses, BE: (round) brackets; [] = AE: brackets, BE: square brackets; {} = braces (sometimes known as curly brackets); ⟨⟩ = angle brackets, or chevrons (&lt;&gt; is sometimes used as a poor man's set of angle brackets). For programmers, who use most of these regularly, they are (usually) parens, square brackets, curlies, and angle brackets (in this case almost always using the less-than/greater-than characters). The text within (any kind of) brackets is known as a <em>parenthesis</em>.

Remarkably, the comma-free version of this is actually the <em>correct</em> version (unless you're from before the Middle Ages, and, thus, use a comma to indicate each and every pause in the sentence).
<ul><li> No, you get a lot of buffaloed buffalo. In fact, you get a lot of buffaloed Buffalo buffalo.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Though the overuse of exclamation marks is well known, it can be just as distracting <em>not</em> to see one where you might reasonably expect to, such as in dialogue when the tag is something like "yelled", "shrieked" or (especially) "exclaimed".
<div class="indent">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">You'd better run before the lion gets you too,</a>" Bob shouted.
</div><ul><li> This is actually due to the limitations of trying to continue a sentence after the quotation. If you put an exclamation there, it can also be understood that a second person is warning Bob, and (new sentence) Bob shouted. When using the exclamation point you can either take this risk, or make a habit of switching to something like
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Bob shouted, "You'd better run before the lion gets you too!"
</div></li><li> One extremely common error is the absence of commas at the end of dialogue. For example; "This looks bad" he said. This is fairly minor, but it can be annoying when it occurs too often.
<ul><li> Or "This looks bad." He said. It creates a stop in the sentence which makes the "he said" sound awkward and out of place.
<ul><li> The thing about quotation marks is that they are, to a certain extent, superfluous; the sentence should make sense without them. So try taking them out. <em>This looks bad he said.</em> and <em>This looks bad. He said.</em> are pretty clearly both wrong. <em>This looks bad, he said.</em>, in contrast, is quite clear, and practically doesn't need the quotation marks put back in. That's why it's correct.

<ul><li> Capitalizing Random Words actually has an effect on how you can Read them (pausing before the word and emphasizing the capitalized word), as well as the Sense you derive from them (you can actually cause the reader to perceive a different lexical entry, even a different pronunciation: lima, Lima). This makes certain Capital Letters very useful in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">certain Contexts</a>, but obviously suffers from overuse as much as the next writing Convention.

In general usage, though, the trend in older works was to capitalize indiscriminately (especially science fiction, but also newly invented fantasy races, so you would have, say, "elves" and "Kender" coexisting). This is not helped at all by the tendency for those races to only have one nation, making it unclear which rule it should follow. Some more recent works have started making the distinction, though. Of course, those unlucky souls writing in 'verses that use capitals, have the choice of annoying the pedants by including them, or the purists by leaving them off.

<ul><li> An error whose commonness almost makes itself a trope is using the abbreviation "i.e." to mean "for example." This is wrong, <strong>wrong</strong>, <em><strong>wrong</strong></em>. "e.g." means "<em>exempli gratia</em>," or "for example." "i.e." means "<em>id est,"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6r1dd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6r1dd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6r1dd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is also often erroneously taken to mean "in essence"</span></em> or "that is." Use i.e. for clarification and e.g. for demonstration. There is some overlap in meaning, but it's important to know the difference.

Use it consistently and it becomes invisible.
</li><li> Incidentally, the same also applies to "asked".
</li><li> That said (sorry), when you have two pages of conversation and every line starts with 'Foo said' or ends with 'Bar said', that's not much better.

</li><li> Dialogue tags other than said are effective <em>only</em> if they are used sparingly, in places where they clarify or (occasionally) emphasize the dialogue. Overuse doesn't simply annoy the reader: it diminishes the effect of the words themselves, to the point where they are virtually meaningless. If every character "exclaims" every line, the word will not have the desired effect, or any effect at all, when one actually does "cry out; say something violently or vehemently" (the dictionary definition of the word "exclaim").
</li><li> Tagging the speaker's names before his/her dialogue can solve this transparently: you identify the speaker quickly and it doesn't intrude into the flow of the narration. Movies scripts, video game captions, interactive novels, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki">This Very Wiki</a>,... all of them have been narrating this way without calling your attention to it.

</div><div class="indent">Charlie: "Lovely, so that's why you called her his ex."
</div><ul><li> This doesn't work in every medium, so know what medium you're writing for and be aware. Using "he said" as a verbal comma in a novel to build suspense in the middle of a sentence is perfectly acceptable. While you don't want to see "he said" or "she said" before or after every line of dialogue in a novel, be aware that when reading it out loud to an audience those omitted tags become critically important unless you're Mel Blanc. So put them in for public readings or recordings. Your listener will thank you.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the fact that it can be seen a lot on this very wiki, it might be worth mentioning that "due to the fact that" is unwieldy and <em>should not</em> be used. You can usually do the same thing with "because (reason)" ("Because I've seen it a lot...") or "due to (reason)", and if not, you should probably rework the sentence anyway. You could also use a semicolon: "I like pancakes because they taste delicious" becomes "I like pancakes; they taste delicious."
</li><li> And,besides merely improper use of punctuation,there are also those who seems to think that adding a space after a comma,a period,a semicolon,or any other sign is optional.Not so;the space is an integral part of the punctuation.There may be some debate whether you should put one or two spaces after a full stop,but zero isn't an option.Especially in word-processed text(or HTML),where the space is the only thing telling the computer where it can break the line.Without it,words clusters together and it can result in irregular line feeds,making paragraphs look ugly.And most spellcheckers don't like it,either.
</li><li> Two spaces after a period was standard in the days of fixed-width fonts. Since the period was so small yet took up a full character's space it could appear to be "floating" between the sentences and impact readability. A second space was added afterwards to firmly fix the period to the end of the preceding sentence. With the proliferation of variable-width fonts, the additional space became obsolete since the period could naturally fall immediately after the final letter of its sentence. Most modern applications render sentences without the additional space even if it's present in the underlying text and most style guides have call for only a single space these days. Typists who learned prior to the mid-to-late-90s still type the extra space simply because it's habit. Neither one space nor two spaces are absolutely incorrect but in professional settings your organization's style guide should be consulted and adhered to.

</li><li> There's a reason spaces were invented in the first place. The oldest manuscripts have no spaces at all, and trying to make sense of them is a big job.
</li></ul></li><li> Some languages, such as Swedish, have a lot of compound words. This means that putting spaces where spaces should not be, or removing spaces that should be there, can have a large impact on the meaning (every day vs the days of the workweek, something being brown-haired vs something being brown and hairy, etc.). It would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a>, except the syntax is perfectly clear.
<ul><li> The organization <a class="urllink" href="http://folk.uio.no/tfredvik/amo/">Astronomer mot orddeling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> exists to counteract this in Norwegian because in Norwegian too, compound words are usually written without spaces. The website provides examples of funny misunderstandings that are caused by misusing spaces in compound words, for example "blind vei" (blind road) instead of "blindvei" (dead end).
</li><li> Phonetic Japanese has no spaces, which can be frustrating. Actually, Japanese has no spaces, period, but vertically written ideograms don't need them much. Unfortunately, you don't see Japanese written vertically in pure ideograms as often as you did in previous centuries. The fact that they've standardized kanji more than makes up for that, but it's still a headache if you're not used to having to work out where words end.
</li><li> Reading a passage rendered mostly in kana is difficult even for a native speaker (well, reader). When written in kanji, however, it's much easier to determine where one word ends and another starts.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "When writing dialogue," Bob explained, "you should always add a paragraph break when a new person talks." Alice shook her head. "Why's that?" she asked. "Because if you don't, it becomes <em>very</em> difficult to tell who's talking at what time," Bob yelled.
<ul><li> As a corollary, when you paragraph-break a monologue, you <em>always</em> omit the end-paragraph quotation marks for all but the last paragraph of the monologue; doing so lets the readers know the paragraphs are still being spoken by the person doing the monologue, and not by anyone else, or is a non-speaking paragraph.
</li><li> "As a second corollary, remember that dialogue tags are never capitalized." Said Bob. "Do you mean that I should keep them lower case even when I end a sentence with a question mark?" Asked Alice. "Yes." Said Bob. "You should also keep in mind that if the sentence would normally end with a period, the period should be replaced with a comma— but only if the period comes <em>before</em> the dialogue tag,"
</li><li> "Fourth of all," continued Bob, "the speaker and his/her actions belong in the same paragraph." <br/>"Why is that, Bob?" asked Alice. <br/>"Because otherwise, the readers could get confused and mistake who is speaking." Alice persisted. <br/>"But shouldn't quotes begin a paragraph?" Bob shook his head. <br/>"Not necessarily." Alice shrugged.
</li><li> As mentioned above, it's possible to break rules if you really know what you're doing. The new-paragraph-for-new-speaker rule is one of the ones you see broken most frequently: one character says something, and the description of other characters' reaction include dialogue. Because a paragraph break would kill the flow, the rule is discarded and one kind of readability trumps another.
<ul><li> One way to ensure this sort of writing works is to alternate sentence order and format, like so: "We have to get to the goblins' lair," Ambrosia said. Anideshi asked, "Why's that?" "Because." In the last sentence, you know that it's Ambrosia speaking from its shift from quote first, then speaker first, and then no speaker in the last sentence.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> And in a similar vein, there's the Block Paragraph Of Doom, where the writer fails to break up the story into paragraphs at all. Not bad in a drabble, but tedious to the point of TL;DR in a multi-chapter fic. Conversely, <em>The Sun</em> and the other tabloids often seem to think it's obligatory to start a new paragraph with each sentence. Wrong. Start a new paragraph when there is a new <em>thought</em>; the first sentence states the theme of the paragraph, and subsequent sentences clarify it.
<ul><li> Many would dispute whether the typical tabloid article involves any thought - other than "I hate x" - at all.
</li><li> This also applies to the dialogue point immediately above: short-reactions are allowed but the paragraph should focus on a single person's idea. Another person's cogent rebuttal or addition merits its own paragraph.
</li></ul></li><li> Very few people seem to get <em>cannot</em> vs. <em>can not</em> right, and write <em>can not</em> where it should be <em>cannot</em>. Even raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">Grammar Nazis</a> routinely get this one wrong. With <em>cannot</em>, negation has scope over the modal ("not possible to X"); in the case of <em>can not</em>, conversely, the modal has scope over negation ("possible to not X"). <em>John cannot go to school</em> means that John lacks the ability to go to school; <em>John can not go to school</em> means that he has the option not to go to school.
<ul><li> Not necessarily the <em>option</em>. This brings us to the oft-encountered mistake of people confusing <em>may</em> and <em>can</em>. No, it's not just "polite" to use "May I?" instead of "Can I?"; "May I?" is actually the more logical choice because <em>can</em> refers to one's ability to do something, whereas <em>may</em> refers to permission.
<ul><li> If people are really bugged by this, try thinking of it as an abbreviation: "Can I do X?" is a short version of "Can I do X without you getting mad at me?"
</li><li> This is actually a myth, perpetuated by generations of schoolteachers. "Can" in this context has been correct since the 19th century except in formal writing.
</li><li> After all, isn't "may" just a word denoting possibility, just like "can"? "I may not be able to make it tonight."
</li></ul></li><li> Back to the original: a potential workaround is to exploit the beloved but underused hyphen. "John cannot run" and "John can not-run" clearly mean two different things, and the hyphen links the negation to the thing it negates. However, this is less intuitive and should only be used if the awkward construction is, you know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">all necessary-ish</a>.
<ul><li> A more intuitive way of doing this is use of italics: John can <em>not</em> run. This does run the risk of confusion with an emphatic "cannot", but it tracks typical usage, especially because the construction is most commonly used when stating multiple options:" John can go to school, or he can <em>not</em> go to school; the choice is his."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One increasingly common error on the Internet is typing a semicolon instead of a colon. For a while, it seemed like a misconception about where semicolons belong (it was especially common in cases where a comma or dash would have worked as well), but now it's starting to crop up between titles and subtitles (for example "Breakin' 2; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricBoogaloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricBoogaloo">Electric Boogaloo</a>"), so it's hard to tell if this is a grammatical error or people's shift keys failing at inopportune times.
</li><li> A dash and a hyphen are not the same thing — way too many people use single hyphens for dashes-without even any spaces around them-and create confusion for people who rightly attempt to read the hyphenated words as conjoined words. Doubling a hyphen, enclosing it in spaces, or both, is enough to serve as a substitute dash if you don't know how to create the real thing, although in publication (as well as formal papers) real dashes are expected, so it's best to learn how. (For the record, double hyphens now auto-convert to dashes on this Wiki, so you don't have to muck about with HTML character codes or memorize the keyboard code to type the real thing.)
<ul><li> By "figure out" we mean "discover which method will cause your word processor to convert hyphen to dash". For example, Open Office Writer and Libre Office Writer will automatically change both <strong>word - word</strong> and <strong>word &amp;hyphen;&amp;hyphen; word</strong> to <strong>word — word</strong>. Word Perfect X9 will only change the double hyphen form. But all three of these will change <strong>word&amp;hyphen;&amp;hyphen;word</strong> into <em>word—word</em>. Figure out what your word processor expects and it will do the work for you.
</li></ul></li><li> If you restructure your sentence so that you don't end it with a preposition... then make sure you don't double up. I don't know for what reason people do this for.
<ul><li> Perhaps the most common example of this is correcting for the old who vs whom issue, and then duplicating the preposition. Somebody thinks they shouldn't say "Who are we here for?" and "corrects" it into "For whom are we here for?"
</li><li> A quick hint is the "m rule." If the sentence could use—or could be slightly modified to use—him, her or them, then "whom" should be used; if he, she, or they is the correct word, then "who" should be used.
</li><li> Better yet, forget about the old bugaboo about not ending sentences with prepositions. It's a rule that was made up by people who were ignorant of the way English grammar actually works. It comes from a rule in Latin grammar: In Latin, a preposition <em>must</em> be followed by its object, otherwise there is no way to tell the object of the preposition.
<ul><li> Apocryphally, Winston Churchill was once told he couldn't end a sentence with a preposition. His response? "That is the sort of arrogant pedantry up with which I will not put."
</li></ul></li><li> State "you get what you pay for" in a way that has the same meaning, does not end with a preposition, and does not have significantly more words.
<ul><li> "That for which you pay, you get."
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> "it's" versus "its". The former is the contraction of "it is" (or "it has"), the latter is the neuter possessive. A good rule of thumb is, if the words "it is" don't fit in the sentence, use "its". For example, "The dog scratched it's balls" would be wrong. It just looks completely nonsensical, unless it's supposed to be a run-on sentence and the dog's <em>name</em> is "Balls."
<ul><li> Or if one Britisher is denying to another that a greyhound has been pulled out of a race. "The dog scratched? It's balls!" would then be quite correct.
</li><li> Although in the neuter possessive, it's unlikely the dog would have balls to scratch.
</li></ul></li><li> Related, "who's" versus "whose". The former means "who is/has", the latter indicates possession. Consider: A car is being advertised for sale. You might ask, "Whose car is being sold?" or, "Who's the current owner of the car?"
<ul><li> You might also ask, "Who's car is being sold?" or, "Whose the current owner of the car?" If you do, surrounding crowds will probably beat you to the point of unconsciousness.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of contractions, some people don seem to realize just how important <em>finishing</em> certain contractions is. Some people can seem to finish contractions ending in "'t", which can become confusing when certain words come up. In some cases, the context can clarify the usage, but other times it can without causing confusion. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16rph');"><sup>Readable version </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16rph" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16rph');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Speaking of contractions, some people <strong>don't</strong> seem to realize just how important <em>finishing</em> certain contractions is. Some people <strong>can't</strong> seem to finish contractions ending in "'t", which <strong>can</strong> become confusing when certain words come up. In some cases, the context <strong>can</strong> clarify the usage, but other times it <strong>can't</strong> without causing confusion.</span> If you want to do this for reasons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Funetik Aksent</a>, just don' forget an apostrophe, so the reader knows <em>something</em> ought to be there, and can guess appropriately.
</li><li> Some people somehow have managed to assume that contractions such as must've and should've - contractions for must have and should have, respectively - are, due to their pronunciation, "must of" and "should of" respectively, and will use this form when they should have used the former. Needless to say, this is a giant mistake.
</li><li> Then there are those who overuse "then" to connect a sequence of events. Then someone reads the work and stumbles over the verbal tic. Then the author wonders how he can avoid overusing "and" or "but" instead. Then the reader explains that "then" usually goes <em>after</em> the subject of the clause, and is not a conjunction. Then the writer has to start all over.
<ul><li> Speaking of "then", there's the then versus than issue. "Then" is used to sequence events as described above, "than" is used to denote the use of one option over another. For example, "I'd rather go to the movies <em>than</em> go to the park," means that the speaker prefers the option of going to the movies over the option of going to the park, while "I'd rather go to the movies <em>then</em> to the park," means that the speaker prefers to go to the movies and go to the park afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> It's possible to replace parentheses, if you really must, with other punctuation marks. Em dashes work — it's one of their alternative uses — as do commas. However, if you are doing this, please — for the love of god) <em>don't switch from one to the other halfway through</em>.
</li><li> A sentence that begins with "I wonder" should end with something other than a question mark, as the sentence is declarative, not interrogative. Otherwise, the sentence would be the speaker wondering if he or she is actually wondering something specific. I wonder why this mistake is so common.
<ul><li> It is acceptable to use a question mark and the phrase "I wonder" in the same sentence provided there is a comma after "I wonder". An example would be "I wonder, how many examples does this trope have?" as opposed to "I wonder how many examples this trope has." An implied version of this (with the speaker trailing off before actually asking the question) might be formatted as "I wonder...?"
</li></ul></li><li> "Your" (belonging to you) vs. "you're" (contraction of "you are") is a major offender. As seen elsewhere, irony is when somebody writes "Your an idiot."

</li><li> This is pretty common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Swing123" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Swing123">Swing123</a>'s works, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin">Rouge Angles of Satin</a>.

As one reviewer put it: "I think someone once told [the author] <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfText">not to write ten sentences where one would suffice</a> and he misinterpreted it."

At the end of the fic, Bruce Wayne buys the rights and recipe and puts it back into production as a gift to Clark, but insists on correcting the punctuation. "That apostrophe was a menace to society."

The title is a question, but there is no question mark. Supposedly it wasn't included because question marks are considered "bad luck" in the film industry. The lack of punctuation implies that the title is an answer, not a question. That is, "the person 'who framed Roger Rabbit'."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoWeeksNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoWeeksNotice">Two Weeks Notice</a></em>. It looks much better as the correct Two Weeks' Notice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></em> features a grammar joke with a call back. First Harmony explains to Harry the difference between "feeling bad" and "feeling badly." Later on Harry tries to belittle "Gay" Perry using the same rule, but Perry's usage is correct, as he instantly points out:
<div class="indent"> <strong>"Gay" Perry</strong>: What, fuckhead? Who taught you grammar? Badly's an adverb. Get out. Vanish.
</div></li><li> A good example of an unintentional spoken example occurs in the final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDaddy">Big Daddy</a></em>, when Sonny Koufax (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a>) tells the guests at his birthday party, "Let's go eat everybody!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian">Presumably, Sonny didn't believe that Hooters was a restaurant for cannibals.</a>

The main character delivers a self-empowering speech to the camera in which he brags about getting straight A's and a near-perfect SAT score. In the end, he says, "Why do I want to go to Harvard? If I was white, would you even need to ask me that question?" The camera lingers on the last line, written out on his college application essay. He should have said "If I <em>were</em> white" because he's using the subjunctive mood. A straight-A Harvard applicant really ought to know that.
</li><li> Eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice there were missing commas in the opening crawl of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWarsTheForceAwakens">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></em>, "[Leia] is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy" needed commas before and after Luke's name. The lack of commas would only be correct if Leia had multiple brothers, which <em>of course</em> led to speculation that the filmmakers were dropping a casual hint of a long-lost Skywalker brother. (Confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jj-abrams-major-star-wars-opening-crawl-error_us_578cd70ce4b0a0ae97c28c6e">it was just an error<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)

<ul><li> There's a famous joke about a misplaced comma in a nature brochure on panda bears. Instead of "Eats shoots and leaves" (meaning what pandas consume for food) it reads, "Eats, shoots and leaves," meaning that it eats, then uses a gun and finally leaves the area. There's a variant where the Australian army adopts the wombat as its mascot, because, like a soldier, it eats, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow">roots</a>, shoots and leaves.

</div></li><li> There is an anecdote in Finnish language of the importance of proper punctuation. A convict sentenced for life in Siberia sent a letter to Czar, begging for mercy. He got reply "Armoa ei Siperiaan" (Mercy no Siberia)" So the poor bloke became even more desperate: did the Czar mean: "Armoa, ei Siperiaan" (Mercy, no Siberia) or "Armoa ei, Siperiaan" (Mercy no, Siberia!).

<ul><li> A rare in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> when the company was held up in front of the Mines of Moria where they thought the doors read "Speak, friend, and enter" where it should have been translated as "Say 'friend' and enter." It helps that Elvish doesn't use much punctuation, including quotation marks. In the books, Gandalf eventually realizes his error, comparing it to a riddle that is simple when you know the answer. In the film, it's Frodo who figures out what the door actually means, calling it a riddle flat-out.
<ul><li> Of course, it seems like all the riddle is testing is your ability to read Elvish, since the riddle could also be solved by simply <em>reading the text aloud</em> without translation.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> Saga series by Stephenie Meyer contains a copious amount of errors: <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/tagged/Sentences-are-not-minivans%21">Run-on sentences<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/tagged/Punctuation_Abuse">poor punctuation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/search/comma">comma<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/tagged/comma_abuse">abuse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/tagged/capital_letters">lack of capitalization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/tagged/Sentence_Fragment">fragments<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but a few examples.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a> does comma splices, these are annoying. Supposedly, they're deliberate. He writes the book, then later goes through removing extra words and pauses in actiony parts in order to make it sound fast. Periods take longer than commas. Ironically, the incorrect punctuation is just going to slow most people down. The correct way to punctuate those sentences would be with a semicolon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, a character's growing madness is shown by his insistence on using multiple exclamation points. It's essentially <em>writing out</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em>: "Five exclamation marks, the sure sign of an insane mind."
</li><li> Then there's Terry Pratchett's exten'sion (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Going Po'stal</a></em>) of the ca'se of the greengrocer's apo'strophe, where one character's dialogue alway's had an apos'trophe next to each S. It i's mos't amu'sing.
</li><li> And the origin of this trope's name: Captain Carrot, who like all good dwarfs writes home to the old mine on a regular basis — he also treats punctuation rather like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. And when swearing in new recruits to the Watch, he dictates the oath precisely down to the punctuation, leading to phrases such as "I swear by open bracket insert recruit's deity of choice here close bracket" (the less bright recruits then follow suit).
</li><li> There Is Also The Text Gag Of Golems Talking Like So, Which Is The Visual Effect For Each Word Thudding Into Place Like A Stone Block.
</li></ul></li><li> James Joyce' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses">Ulysses</a></em> has a final chapter with only two full stops. Also, Joyce refused to capitalize religious words (jew, christian, jesuit) and hated quotation marks, instead using a dash to indicate a line of dialogue.
</li><li> "Certain" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> writers seem to be deathly afraid of conjunctions and skip right to the comma.
</li><li> Lampooning this is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EatsShootsAndLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EatsShootsAndLeaves">Lynne Truss</a> made her name.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon">Flowers for Algernon</a></em>, in which the narrator's grammar starts off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">terribly</a>, then improves and then declines in tandem with fluctuations in his intellect. Charlie's two entries after Alice teaches him punctuation are overflowing with it. The next one contains a breakthrough as he's finally using punctuation properly. "Today, I learned, the comma, this a comma (,) a period, with a tail, Miss Kinnian, says its important, because, it makes writing, better, she said, somebody, could lose, a lot of money, if a comma, isnt, in the, right place, I dont have, any money, and I dont see, how a comma, keeps you, from losing it,". In the next entry, he's passed beyond the comma and sticks a different punctuation mark after almost every word he writes.
</li><li> There's a particularly disconcerting example of run-on sentences in the final book in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>, being well over two hundred words about the metaphor "in the dark", ballerinas, digging and a locked cabinet.
</li><li> The Voynich Manuscript has no discernible forms of punctuation; there are only spaces. This is a feature of many medieval texts, since punctuation really <em>was</em> optional up until the 18th century. On the other hand, it might also mean that the Voynich script is really just that much gobbledygook, as its authenticity is still disputed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> and other works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll">Lewis Carroll</a>, "ca'n't", "sha'n't" and "wo'n't" have two apostrophes. He insisted that "the popular usage is wrong." This is probably a joke about how a word like "shan't" abbreviates both the LL and the O in "shall not," so he's humorously asserting that his strange-looking abbreviations are more correct.
</li><li> Similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> would use archaic spellings and terms <em>intentionally</em> to give a time-spanning feel to his stories. He would also use diacritic marks such as in <em>diäphenous</em> or <em>preëminent</em> (which we still see today, though rarely, in words like <em>naïve</em>). Diacritics like this are used to indicate that the two vowels are pronounced as separate syllables instead of a single diphthong (diaeresis). These days the only people who use them are those who believe grammar is deadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheNewYorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheNewYorker">The New Yorker</a>'s style sheet).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> used a two-period ellipsis .. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em>. I've never .. quite .. figured out why (remember this is the writer who had his character saying "<strong>An</strong> U.F.O.", and who figured that if "handkerchief" had a silent D in it, then the short form should be "handky").
<ul><li> (In total pedantic fairness, would "<strong>a</strong> Unidentified Flying Object" be correct? This gets into the question of whether an acronym should be conjugated as itself or as the extended phrase, a debate which has yet to be settled.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotzAndMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotzAndMeyer">Götz and Meyer</a></em> by David Albahari uses no paragraph breaks, apparently to indicate the narrator's mental breakdown.
</li><li> Toyed with in Vinge's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowsEnd">Rainbows End</a></em>, which may or may not be missing an apostrophe depending on your political views.
</li><li> The Israeli writer Hanny Nachmias always places her periods after the quotation marks, or, to be exact, after ALL the quotation marks. Even if there already is a question or exclamation mark inside the quote. She also abuses colons and dashes left and right. The bad grammar and slang are at least partially justified because the book is written from the point of view of a dumb teenage blonde.
</li><li> <em>The Shelters of Stone</em>, the fifth book in Jean M. Auel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren">Earth's Children</a></em> series, is filled with comma splices.

Whereas the war books feature a terse, grammatically correct style (rather like most military communication), in <em>Running</em> he used intentional misspellings and punctuation errors, to underscore the rural nature of his subject.

The next day he apologizes.
</li><li> John Norman, he of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor">Gor</a> series of novels, is quite content to overuse the comma; nay, even more, the semicolon; rather than using periods to separate his thoughts he will use the semicolon; it is annoying; you start to count the number of semicolons in a paragraph; often his page long paragraphs will be only one or two sentences long; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">he will use semicolons</a>; this is especially true of his descriptive paragraphs.

</li><li> Used intentionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogStars">The Dog Stars</a></em>. Higs's narration uses idiosyncratic punctuation, often putting periods mid-sentence to give the words a halting, staccato rhythm.

Higs is both a poet and cracking up from loneliness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, so the style conveys his lyrical spirit and deteriorating mental state.

Now, this might not be weird, but around the time this show ran, there was a well-known Dutch public figure going by the name Chriet Titulaer. Chriet is a <em>male</em> name. To top it off: Chriet and Griet are pronounched exactly the same. He even mentions that Hans and Grietje are the Titulaer brothers. And this is just the very start of the "Spreukjesbos" segment.

In reality the comma is after "turns" and means that when Nale (who has a goatee) turns on them Haley (who has red hair) would be able to roll a 20 and hit Nale.

<ul><li> The minefield of grammatical rules, exceptions and linguistic gray areas is the main reason why most major publications adopt or create <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements_of_style">an official style guide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for their writers.
</li><li> This applies to questions of usage where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">there are valid arguments either way</a>. For instance, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> among grammarians as to whether you should use a serial comma ("A, B, and C") or not ("A, B and C"). The most expedient answer is just to go with your publisher's style guide. This is also known as the Oxford Comma argument and is discussed in the Underpunctuation section above.
</li><li> This is far, far, far too common in Dutch, where the apostrophe denotes a short grapheme corresponding to a long vowel in plurals, mostly in originally foreign words. (Example: "Auto" means "car". "Auto's" means "cars", because "Autos" would be pronounced wrong, and "Autoos" goes against all grammar rules.) The apostrophe stands for a sound that's included in speech, but left out in written language. It... tends to go wrong.
<ul><li> The same thing has been done to substitute for graves, acutes, and macrons. Once again, this convention tends to go wrong. Especially when it's impossible to tell if a word is supposed to be possessive, contracted, or have an accent on a vowel....
</li><li> Over-punctuation can occur in Dutch as well: very few people are aware that the apostrophe between a word and an S, like in English, can be omitted entirely in Dutch. In fact, not even the Microsoft Word grammar control knows about it, which is probably one of the reasons it's so little known: the Dutch tend to rely on the Word grammar and spelling control completely because of how difficult the Dutch language is.
</li><li> Use of the apostrophe after the vowel in place of an acute or grave accent is widespread in Italian, even on signs in Italy itself. Even worse is that the word processors used to write such mistakes will often auto-correct the apostrophe to an accent, but will leave it hanging over empty space instead of moving it above the vowel.
</li></ul></li><li> This can also happen when people write English according to the grammatical rules of their native language. German-speakers writing English tend to insert commas in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">places, that do not require a comma in English</a> but would require a comma in German.
<ul><li> Germanophones writing in English also often have Trouble not putting Capitalization on every Noun, like they are used to in their Birth Language. Anglophones tend to overcapitalize when writing in French, too (but then, <a class="urllink" href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_des_majuscules_en_fran&lt;!--C3--&gt;A7ais">the full capitalization rules<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are tricky even for French natives).
</li><li> Likewise, the punctuation rules for the three languages are different. A colon, question mark or semi-colon is preceded by a space "example : this", German and French use commas less frequently than English. Decimals are marked with a comma, which is used in English as a separator "1,234" is just less than one and a quarter in French and just less than a thousand and a quarter in English. Dialogue in French texts is marked with «», then a dash for any speech running on. German uses  or »« (yes, the inverse of the French) and is more prone to using free indirect speech than English. Trilinguals despair.
<ul><li> Quebecois Francophones follow English rules for commas and decimals within numbers. Conversely, South African Anglophones use the German/French/Dutch ones.
</li></ul></li><li> Spanish (or at least the Mexican dialect thereof) uses dashes to indicate the beginning and end of dialogue (-like this -for example). International Spanish rules set the use of a long dash () for starting a dialogue, with additional long dashes to add an explanation:
<div class="indent"> It would be like this said this troper, exactly like this.
</div></li></ul></li><li> The Apple website, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">the previous entry on this very page</a>, has a tendency to mistake the word too (an adverb) as something that constantly calls for a comma preceding it. While it is possible to precede a 'too' with a comma, it is the editorial phrase of which they form a part that calls for the comma, not the word too... ever.
<ul><li> eg. "Tias, too drunk to walk, decided to fly home." Here the too forms part of a tangent in the sentence, and hence the comma is appropriate.
</li><li> eg. "Tias, contrary to popular belief, can fly, too." Here the too is an integral part of the grammar of the sentence: it tells the reader something about how the ability to fly, and hence it should not be separated from the verb by its own comma.
</li><li> as contrasted with: "Tias was too drunk to walk and flew home." Here the too modifies an adjective and does not require a comma to separate the clause of which it is a part.
</li></ul></li><li> WEATHER BULLETINS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES OFTEN USE ELLIPSES IN PLACE OF ALMOST ALL PUNCTUATION... IN ADDITION TO TYPING EVERYTHING IN ALL CAPS AS IF THEY WERE STILL SENDING OUT TELEGRAMS LIKE FIFTY YEARS AGO...
<ul><li> The WeatherBug Site Tries To Add Some Sanity By Changing The Entire Message To Title-Case... But Keeps The Ellipses... And Humorously... Always Renders The Word "IN" IN All Caps... Assuming It To Be Short For "Indiana".
</li></ul></li><li> When Gertrude, wife of King Andrew of Hungary took control of the kingdom in the king's absence, a group of conspirators decided to take down the queen and asked the clergy for support. The archbishop, not wanting to choose sides, answered with a letter but deliberately left out all the commas, leaving room for two possible but entirely contradicting interpretations:
<div class="indent"><em>You should not be afraid to murder the queen. It will be a good thing. If everybody agrees to it, I do not object. <br/>You should not murder the queen. To be afraid will be a good thing. If everybody agrees to it, I do not: I object.</em>
</div><ul><li> The same joke has been made with the city of Ulm's catchphrase: "Ulm hat was alle suchen!" The is supposed to be one comma in the sentence, but where? "Ulm hat, was alle suchen!" means 'Ulm has something for everyone' and "Ulm hat was, alle suchen!" means 'Ulm has something, everyone's looking [for it].'
</li></ul></li><li> Fox News' Sean Hannity came under fire in the fall of 2016 for openly cheerleading GOP nominee Donald Trump, and engaged his naysayers on Twitter. In response to one user who accused him of being a lapdog, Hannity tweeted "<a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/791775981719719936">God is my only master jackass. "The Truth Shall Set You Free".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" His forgetting of a comma between "master" and "jackass" made it look like blasphemy and not an insult directed at a critic.
</li><li> One of the most common punctuation errors in Polish texts is putting an apostrophe, or multiple apostrophes, in every conjugated foreign name. Simplifying things a bit, one should do so only when the name ends with 'y' or a muted vowel. Omitting apostrophes is actually less haphazard (that's how names were written in the early 20th century) than spamming them everywhere.
</li><li> There exist within numerous Western countries, and many others, groups which call themselves "sovereign citizens" or something similar. Regardless of one's opinion of their legal status, oftentimes their legal documentation (usually submitted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">pro se</a>) is deliberately written to be not only obtuse, but also contradictory, containing enough grammatical errors to make even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Captain Carrot</a> wince. They are also famous for legal theories that rely entirely on grammar rules they made up; for instance, that John Doe and JOHN DOE (as it appears in government documents) are legally distinct entities and only the latter has to pay taxes.
</li><li> Subverted by, of all organizations, the British Army. When the regiment now known as "21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve)" was established, it was known as "The Artist's Rifles" after its founder, who had fancied himself a painter in his youth. However, since no two Army clerks could agree on where the apostrophe went, the Army eventually decided to leave it out altogether.
</li><li> According to one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://pics.me.me/cozi-when-i-was-12-i-got-banned-from-yahoo-11837273.png">post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, in one AOL group chat, everyone was making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Homer Simpson</a> faces (like so: (8^(|)) and a girl named Crystal forgot to add the nose, resulting in one group chat member saying "You forgot the nose crystal". Because that user forgot to put a comma between "nose" and "Crystal", they were booted from the chat for saying "nose crystal", which led AOL to believe they were selling drugs to minors.
