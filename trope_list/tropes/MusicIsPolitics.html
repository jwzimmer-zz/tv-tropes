Not to mention being stuck with a terrible unfair contract that more or less makes them slaves to the label. Young upcoming artists are more prone to becoming victims of these types of shady record deals. Rappers of the late '80s and early '90s were also victims of these deals, as were pop-punk and emo-pop acts from the early to mid-2000s and deathcore acts of the late 2000s and early 2010s.

</p><p></p><hr/><h2>Related tropes and subtropes of this include:</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlameGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlameGame">Blame Game</a>: Usually happens when an album fails or underperforms. But the ultimate issue is usually people blaming other people over things like missing money, music rights, and royalties, etc...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: While payola is less of an issue than it used to be due to the declining importance of radio, sponsored tracks on streaming services have taken on a very similar role. Inverted in the case of things like tour and label buy-ons: tour buy-ons are often sold to up-and-coming artists as an investment for necessary exposure, but seldom work out that way, as buy-on bands always play at the bottom of the bill (meaning that the crowds will be sparse, especially if doors are regularly late), are often treated poorly by headliners, and are regularly looked down upon by their peers, and the "exposure" often leads to overexposure, as regularly buying on to bills will quickly cause audiences to grow tired of you and will give you a reputation for being "that band" that is on every tour, but has no fanbase and never gets bigger. If a headliner regularly solicits buy-ons, then they are almost certainly over the hill and their guarantees have gone down, and they use buy-ons to subsidize the tour. Label buy-ons, meanwhile, are strictly scams - no decent label is going to request money up front in order to get signed.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>: Disillusionment over industry politics eventually leads to this, and a band may also sometimes eat itself alive if the infighting turns into one or more parties engaging in shady backroom deals to shut other members out. Basically, if a band's inactivity can be blamed on legal battles between members, this is why.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a>: An artist could be a slave to this thanks to this trope, especially if morality clauses are involved. Morality clauses themselves are not inherently bad, especially in band situations - if one member does something fucked up, habitually pisses people off and burns bridges, has out-of-control substance issues that they cannot or will not address, or generally is a major and consistent source of embarrassment and hardship for the band, a morality clause can often provide an easy way to fire them without having to deal with a bunch of legal wrangling (and potentially shutting them out of royalties if they did something truly awful that would give many listeners a valid reason to boycott the music for fear of their money going to that person). Bands and labels alike know that members who bring lots of bad press are not good for a band's immediate or long-term prospects as a business entity, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">Overshadowed by Controversy</a> is a dreaded status that can and will ruin a band or permanently cripple it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>: Darkly speaking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a> (and contract disputes) can eventually lead to this trope as a form of punishment if the label doesn't get what they want. Essentially, they can invoke this trope on an uncooperative artist's album till the contract expires, which could take years and make it impossible to jump labels. Tragically, this also often ends up making it nearly impossible for said artist to reestablish themselves in the mainstream. Ever wanted to know what happens to that artist that dropped that great album and then disappeared? ...Well, this is probably what happened to them.
<ul><li> If it wasn't the label, it very well could have been band politics; rampant infighting and a revolving door of personnel caused by general dysfunction and/or a few members being control freaks or complete assholes can cause the conception of a new album to drag on and on or just eventually hit an insurmountable brick wall. Is a band touring on the same album for far longer than they should with a new lineup on at least a yearly basis with only vague assurances that a new album is coming with no actual evidence? Again, this trope is probably why.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>: Created a badass tracklist for your album? Plus it has a recurring theme, concept, and message throughout? ...Too bad, because you're gonna do it all over again whether you like it or not. Sometimes you're forced to shoehorn in songs (or even another artist) that the label wants, thus derailing the theme and concept or style of your whole album. Discussed in the number 1 spot in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1764-i-was-reality-tv-judge-5-secrets-i-shouldnt-tell-you.html">Article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Same deal for touring. Got an awesome lineup all planned out and locked in? Well, that's too bad, because someone else just bought on, someone else's management is cashing in a favor owed to them by your management and shoehorning in one of their acts, someone else's management is being unreasonable and making ridiculous demands, or your management and someone else's management have beef and are locked in a power struggle!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto">Executive Veto</a>: Same as above, most artists don't even have the final say-so over their <em>OWN</em> track list.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a>: When a hot new trend emerges, labels are going to want in on the action, and that usually means that they're going to snatch up as many acts within that trend that have any kind of meaningful buzz as possible. The contracts that those acts tend to be given are more often than not highly exploitative and designed to wring as much out of them as possible while still giving them just enough to keep them going.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHollywood">Horrible Hollywood</a>: The music industry equivalent thereof. An environment filled almost exclusively with ruthless, shallow, bitchy, exploitative people who are more focused on chasing fleeting trends than on meaningful creative endeavors and who are perfectly willing to stab others in the back to get what they want tends not to be a very pleasant place to spend time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a>: Often enforced on female artists, mainly to acquire a male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>. But could also very well be voluntary thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money, Dear Boy</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">Sex Sells</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyPackaging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyPackaging">Sexy Packaging</a>: Could also double as false advertising. Especially if the album has nothing to do with sexual themes or topics.
</li><li> Can also be used as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">Artist Revolt</a> by a younger artist attempting to break free from the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a>. Because honestly, you can only go so far making sugar pop songs and albums while in your early to mid-20s without looking ridiculous. Of course, opinions vary on whether or not hotter and sexier (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> for that matter) is a good way to go about breaking free of contractual purity.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender">I Coulda Been a Contender!</a>: Happens a <em>lot</em> to naive or inexperienced new artists who quickly find themselves getting lots of attention and enjoying a day in the limelight, only to get chewed up and spit out by the business side of things. Did you see a new artist that got a lot of buzz tour relentlessly for a year or two until they suddenly imploded and either broke up or had a massive lineup change that destroyed their momentum? If you did, they probably got screwed by everyone on their team and either cut their losses or cracked under the pressure and ate each other alive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout">Jaded Washout</a>: Anyone who has spent enough time in the music industry will tell you that this is a common phenomenon. Most, if not all of them were wide-eyed young idealists at one point who had some success, then either made a bad choice that they were led to believe was a good choice at the time or were just screwed over by someone who they trusted, and the experience changed them forever. They almost always become bitter cutthroats who are paranoid of getting screwed over again, so they instead opt to screw other people over before they can screw them, or just look out for themselves and lead newcomers to their likely doom as long as there's a tangible benefit to doing so.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ">The Last DJ</a>: In the literal sense if a DJ refuses to adhere to the playlist. Alternatively, it could happen to the artists themselves if they refuse to compromise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: Usually enforced on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a> artists. But, just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a>, this could also very well be voluntary.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing">Misaimed Marketing</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money, Dear Boy</a>: The cause of all of this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioFriendliness">Radio Friendliness</a>: If you wanna get played on the radio, your song better not be too dark, too controversial, too political (even if music is politics, that doesn't mean politics is music), too long (gotta fit those commercials in), or too niche.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">Revolving Door Band</a>: Often a result of this trope, though not always.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; Roll</a>: On one side, hedonistic, hard-partying, and occasionally debauched images are often played up for marketing purposes, especially with hard rock and hip-hop artists. On the other side, this is a <em>huge</em> source of "you should have been a fly on the wall" in the industry, especially for management - being a manager of an artist who lives life way too hard for their own good involves sweeping lots of ridiculous, dysfunctional, and often utterly fucked-up situations under the rug and coming up with plausible cover stories for when you have to cart them off to rehab or when the band desperately wants to fire someone but can't (or when they did something truly heinous that is going to get out one way or another), as well as figuring out how to explain this latest snafu to an executive who is already sick of their shit.

<ul><li> This can be seen in the manga/anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em>. The band Bad Luck, originally a duo, becomes a trio when the director of the record company decided that Shuichi should take front stage without being constricted behind the keyboards.

<ul><li> The documentary <em>Before the Music Dies</em> covers this.
</li><li> The documentary <em>Electric Purgatory</em> uses this trope to explain why modern black rock musicians have such a hard time breaking into the mainstream during the last 30 years or so. Long story short — the record labels didn't know how to market them to mainstream white listeners since most of them weren't interested in listening to "black music". So the labels found their white counterparts. T'was done before that as well during the '60s with white counterparts like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>.

I can't save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a>." That quote pretty much sums up this trope.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> was very bitter over this.

She publicly battled with BMG honcho Clive Davis over creative control of her album, then suffered a vengeful smear campaign by her own label. <em>My December</em> only sold 800,000 copies (a disappointment compared to <em>Breakaway</em>'s huge success). She canceled her tour and fired her management after the <em>My December</em> debacle. She was also allegedly pressured to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">lose weight</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewEdition">New Edition</a> learned this the hard way when they were first starting out. They were pretty much the biggest pop group in the world at the time. But after a huge tour their tour but dropped them off right in front of their Bostonian housing project....<em>flat BROKE</em>. New Edition is probably one of the worst cases of child exploitation in the history of the music biz.
</li><li> Rapper Chamillionaire discusses this trope with his fans via video chat, basically explaining why his album <em>Venom</em> was stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>. It's been permanently shelved due to an agreement with Universal in order for him to be able to leave the label.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast">OutKast</a> experienced this after their record label got bought out. The executive who signed them was excluded from the merger, and the new executives didn't have the same understanding. Because of this, the Idlewild soundtrack wasn't marketed properly, and despite having a significant buzz built up around the songs "Mighty O" and "Hollywood Divorce" they weren't able to record videos for them. Things got worse, when Big Boi decided to record a solo album he butted heads with executives for various reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">such as them taking away his creative control, and trying to get him to copy other artists</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">The album was held up for three years.</a> Eventually, the label let him out of his contract, but under the stipulation that Andre 3000 can't collaborate with him on his solo records, as the label wanted exclusive rights to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutKast">OutKast</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveIronFrenzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveIronFrenzy">Five Iron Frenzy</a>'s song "Blue Mix" denounces the practices that some touring bands use to screw over their opening acts (namely, having the soundboard guy deliberately mix the opening band badly, or forcing the bands to mark up their merchandise).
</li><li> Project 86 felt they had been ripped off by their record label, so as soon as they went independent they recorded the album <em>Songs to Burn Your Bridges By</em> to vent their anger over the whole incident. Interestingly, they ended up reconciling with the label soon afterward and re-released <em>Bridges</em> on that same label.
</li><li> Payola bribes, and radio station consolidation.
<ul><li> The scandal hasn't hurt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez">Jennifer Lopez</a>'s career though. As she was a huge part of that payola scandal (circa <em>Rebirth</em> album), which would explain a lot of her musical success actually.
</li><li> On a similar note, there's a few people who believe viewer participation shows like <em>Total Request Live</em> and <em>106 &amp; Park</em> are/were rigged.
</li></ul></li><li> A large number of R&amp;B fans think this trope is in play every time a sexy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">not-too-black</a> female singer whose talent lies more in dancing than singing becomes popular. Unfairly or not, these people like to point at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyoncé</a>, Kristinia DeBarge (though this has more to do with whether or not she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">using the DeBarge name to get successful</a>), Keri Hilson, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls">Pussycat Dolls</a>, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">until she died</a>), among many others, as examples of "industry whores". Of course, these artists all have fans, and they will come out in droves to defend them. Detractors of the aforementioned singers will accuse them and the industry of impeding the success of more "pure" and "mature" R&amp;B/Soul singers like Conya Doss, Amel Lareaux, Heather Headly, India.Arie, Angie Stone, Corinne Bailey Rae, Vivian Green, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JillScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JillScott">Jill Scott</a>, and so on.
<ul><li> To add insult to injury, some of the latter artists were either writers or back-up singers for the former to help them sound good. They were basically languishing in the background helping arguably lesser artists, and the only reason they even got a deal was probably that they were <em>promised</em> one by the company for their work with the former R&amp;B/pop artists. The former, artists get the most attention and their albums are fast-tracked (That's if they don't fall victim to this trope themselves), while the latter artists sometimes see their albums get shelved, or under-promoted.
</li></ul></li><li> Some see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a>, Hip-Hop look as this. Basically, she's just trying to sell records, and get attention through the controversy. Let's be honest here, it's not like she didn't know this would cause controversy. Could also make the argument that she likely did it to get out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> which she might see as holding her back. In addition to all the above, she's also maturing and getting older, so this and all of the above are all reasons for the new look. But it's hard not to believe that record sales aren't the real goal. Especially after she eventually dropped the image, causing some critics and fans to accuse her of cultural appropriation.
</li><li> Most people don't know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys">Alicia Keys</a> has been around since the mid-'90s. She languished in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> because the labels didn't know what to do with her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore">Mandy Moore</a> had to deal with industry politics when she got older and wanted more creative control over her music.

</li><li> Many would argue (and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">basically confirms this in a 60 Minutes interview</a>) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s fame came as a result of her working the system to her advantage. She spent several years writing for other artists before trying to make it on her own. As a result, she knew to play by the record label's rules by pumping out ridiculously catchy songs about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">love</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">success</a>, and when she made it big she was pretty much given license to do whatever she wanted. Compare her first album, <em>The Fame</em>, to her second, <em>The Fame Monster</em>, which more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructs</a> all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">Sex Sells</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">Money, Dear Boy</a> tropes used in the former.
<ul><li> She wouldn't be the first one to get famous by this method, although she was one of the more notable ones. It's also at least somewhat suspected that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KendrickLamar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KendrickLamar">Kendrick Lamar</a> did the same with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodKidMAADCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodKidMAADCity">good kid, m.A.A.d city</a></em>, which, while still very dark, was decidedly more radio-friendly, accessible, and overall mainstream-friendly than the extremely dense and difficult <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. Given the sharp contrast in accessibility between the two, it's not unreasonable to assume that the former was intended to be an album to blow up with that he could still stand behind, while the latter was intended to be the album that he wanted to make and could make thanks to the free reign provided to him with his newfound status.
</li><li> This method doesn't always work out though, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> example proved.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes">LeAnn Rimes</a>' hit this trope hard later in her career.
</li><li> Former winner Steve Brookstein has suggested that there is an element of this in the career of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a></em> winners.

Why? At the time of recording, Bush was signed to Hollywood Records, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s music label (yes, they were going to be working for <em>Disney</em>). After Disney president Frank Wells died suddenly, however, executives who had cold feet about Bush being associated with a family-friendly company took over majority opinion, and the band was quickly dropped before they could even release their album. Bush's manager Rob Kahane then went to court other labels for the band to sign with, and eventually got the attention of Interscope Records. Interscope ultimately signed the group and finally put <em>Sixteen Stone</em> out in the market near the end of the year.
</li><li> Female R&amp;B supergroup <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC">TLC</a> was a victim of this, according to all three members of the group. They claimed despite them creating a number one selling album in <em>Crazy Sexy Cool</em>, they didn't see a dime of the money because of extreme expenses cost — the result of a poorly written business contract. They even famously walked out on stage with their pockets hanging out during the middle of an award show, symbolizing that despite the praise and popularity, they were still broke as artists. And after winning many music awards, their aftershow interview was mostly how they sold millions of albums but were still poor. The group ended up filing chapter 11 bankruptcy shortly afterwards.
<ul><li> Granted, that wasn't all that was at play. Watkins' medical bills (due to sickle-cell disease) and Lopes' court-ordered fines (due to a presumably drunken fight with her boyfriend, Atlanta Falcons player Andre Rison, that resulted in her throwing a bunch of his shoes into a plexiglass bathtub and lighting them on fire, which melted the tub and set the entire house on fire), and general internecine conflict were all contributing factors to their financial situation.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a> is a notable example due to Trent Reznor fighting back against this on multiple occasions. Firstly, after the first album <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em> was released in 1989, it initially didn't make much of an impact in terms of sales (the record label expected "Down In It" to become a radio hit). As a result, TVT Records ordered Trent to make a more successful album. Despite this, as NIN toured, the album grew in popularity, receiving airplay on MTV and a large following. As NIN's popularity increased, TVT then changed their mind and ordered Trent to create another Pretty Hate Machine due to the album's success. When TVT began to take over creative control and refusing to terminate the contract, Trent refused to release another album. However, he secretly recorded the Broken EP in this time, which was deliberately made very loud and abrasive as a "fuck you" to the labelling of NIN as synthpop by TVT. At that time, Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records, in discussions with NIN's manager, John Malm (who wasn't part of TVT) managed to transfer him to Interscope, at the same time giving him creative control as well as his own vanity label, Nothing Records. <em>Broken</em> was finally released in 1992. Then in 2004, Trent Reznor sued John Malm after he accused him of owing him $2 million, and it emerged that Malm had taken advantage of Trent during his alcohol addiction. Trent won the suit, and Nothing Records collapsed. In 2007, he then left Interscope after a dispute over the label's overpricing of <em>Year Zero</em> in Australia and afterwards going independent. However, in 2012 he returned to major labels due to issues with promoting independently, albeit with a specially negotiated contract.

The "Trent Reznor Vocal Version" finally saw an official release on the 1994 box set <em>Black Box — Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years</em> - Ironically, said box set was released by TVT, who had recently purchased Wax Trax!.
</li></ul></li><li> At least according to recent (reputable) biographies on the artist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> was a victim of record label politics and legal issues in much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. He left his original American distributors, MCA Records, in less-than-friendly terms, him feeling that they had done a poor job promoting his late-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">1970's</a> releases (though it did not help matters when Elton laid off most to all of his classic band by 1975, stopped working with producer Gus Dudgeon by 1978, had little involvement with original lyricist Bernie Taupin and had by 1976 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">come out as bisexual</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">costing him much of his market in Middle America and rock radio in the process</a>. Elton sued MCA for breach of contract for not paying for Elton's next album, 1981's <em>The Fox</em>. Elton joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeffenRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeffenRecords">Geffen Records</a> in 1981, hoping that the then-new label would treat him better. The counter-lawsuit MCA gave Elton alleged that part of <em>The Fox</em> was comprised of 1979 recordings made during the production of 1980's <em>21 At 33</em>, when Elton was still signed to the label, meaning that MCA would have the rights to release the album. Geffen felt it in their best interests not to heavily promote <em>The Fox</em> to make it less commercially attractive to convince MCA to settle or to make it less of an incentive in case MCA won the rights.
<ul><li> There were also rumors that Geffen's founder, David Geffen had invited Elton to appear at the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cats">Cats</a></em> in 1982, which Geffen helped to finance, only for Elton to politely turn the invitation down as he was rehearsing for a tour. This supposedly angered David so much that he might have sabotaged promotion of Elton's albums and singles from then on, and though <em>Too Low For Zero</em> was a resounding success and he had a few more hits in the decade, the albums sold (and were promoted less and less). By the time of the end of Elton's contract in 1986, he had released the Contractual Obligation album, <em>Leather Jackets</em>, an experiment in '80's synth-pop, and an inconsistent commercial failure. He rejoined MCA in 1987.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted and awesomely flipped on its' head by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a>, whom nobody would sign when he started out, decided to start his own record label - Roc-A-Fella Records - in 1995 (releasing his debut <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">Reasonable Doubt</a></em> a year later). The album was a success, and since Jay was one of the 3 execs (at the time) who had control over his music, this never happened, nor has ever in his career (to the point where he <em>bought out</em> his contract at Def Jam - a company which he was previously CEO of - for $5m, to run his own label - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RocNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RocNation">Roc Nation</a> - again). To add the icing on the cake, Jay's tenure at Roc-A-Fella helped to establish a lot of the superstar rappers of the early 2000s (admittedly however, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">one</a> has had a lasting mainstream career), and his tenure at Def Jam helped to establish artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyoncé</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> (all of whom are also signed to Roc Nation).

But as time passed Bowie saw little of the money his work was generating, and the litigation required to break away from this relationship lasted him the rest of the decade.
</li><li> As well, his label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords">RCA Records</a> wasn't happy with his choice to move into less-commercial artistic realms with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LowDavidBowieAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LowDavidBowieAlbum">Low</a></em> in 1977, the first step towards his choice to break away from that company in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>.
</li><li> At his next label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EMIAmericaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EMIAmericaRecords">EMI America Records</a>, he had the biggest commercial success of his career with 1983's <em>Let's Dance</em>, but choosing to continue with that mainstream album's style as the label pressured him for another blockbuster proved artistically unsatisfying for him; critics and fans regard that stretch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. He left the label when it had reservations about a second album he made with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">Hard Rock</a> group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinMachineAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinMachineAlbum">Tin Machine</a>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> <em>Toy</em> (which focused on remakes of his little-known work from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">Space Oddity</a></em>) was supposed to be his first album after <em>hours...</em> but wound up shelved by EMI/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords">Virgin Records</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In either case, this was the cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllShallPerish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllShallPerish">All Shall Perish</a>'s extended period of inactivity from 2013 to late 2015. The reason given at the start was related to Hernan "Eddie" Hermida's new job with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuicideSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuicideSilence">Suicide Silence</a>, as the latter's management had allegedly placed severe restrictions on his activities with All Shall Perish until he was "well-established" as the new Suicide Silence frontman (and it was apparently understood that running afoul of them could have <em>dire</em> consequences for All Shall Perish), which would have required him to be well into the touring cycle for a new Suicide Silence album before he could do anything with All Shall Perish again. This allegedly forced Mike Tiner's hand and left him with no choice but to fire Eddie. However, a new side emerged when they came back in 2015 with virtually all of the <em>Awaken the Dreamers</em> lineup (<em>including</em> Eddie) minus Tiner and plus founding member Caysen Russo in his place and an explanation that the hiatus was actually due to a legal battle with Tiner over rights to the band's name, royalties, and control over band assets that had only just concluded, raising the reasonable suspicion that the original reason given was a cover for Tiner to make him look better. Basically, regardless of what the full story was, this trope was clearly in effect at that time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> signed a deal with unscrupulous manager Artie Ripp in 1972, giving Ripp control over the rights to Billy's music and productions, as well as little in the way of royalties for the singer. Joel stayed out of the limelight while working at a piano bar while his new managers negotiated to get Joel out of the deal; one compromise Joel made would be that Artie's "Family Productions" logo would be applied to each of Billy's albums for the following ten years, and a portion of Billy's royalties was awarded to Ripp even when Ripp had little or nothing to do with Billy's management or direction.
</li><li> This is why it has been taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool">tool</a> so long to make a new album.

</li><li> One story related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> (which, perhaps, may have been the case for many artists at the time) included in the liner notes to a 2013 reissue of their 1973 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> <em>A Passion Play</em> was that although <em>Melody Maker</em> magazine critic Chris Welch, a fan and champion of the band, may have had some dislike for the album (admittedly one of their more challenging, polarizing efforts), he embarrassingly admitted to the band that the level of vitriol he heaped upon them and the album was meant to dissuade readers from thinking the magazine had a pro-Tull bias and were "in bed with" the group (or progressive rock in general); the magazine wanted to show (certainly in light of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> just around the corner) that they were uncompromising and not lacking in integrity, and it was Tull's turn to face bad press. The review became the basis from which music newspapers all over England and America based their own reviews, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash">Critical Backlash</a> against the band which follows them to this day. It didn't help when their manager, Terry Ellis, published a contrived press statement without the band's permission to gain sympathy, stating how hurt the band was about the poor reviews to the point they would cease touring. Bandleader Ian Anderson would express his own annoyance at Ellis' statement, feeling it made the band look "petulant" in the media.
</li><li> Several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JelloBiafra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JelloBiafra">Jello Biafra</a>'s songs are about this, most notably "Pull My Strings". The band became a literal example of this trope when Jello's former bandmates sued him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryCow">Henry Cow</a> formed the Rock in Opposition festivals as a protest against music industry practices.
</li><li> This trope is one reason the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death">Control Denied</a> album has languished in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for so long: the surviving members were embroiled in a lengthy legal struggle with their record company. (Then their gear got stolen...)
</li><li> Bonnie McKee was a teenager who signed a lucrative deal, struggled to see her album released because the label didn't know how to sell her, and despite the first single gathering internet buzz the record flopped. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5646340/singles-lady-bonnie-mckee-is-looking-out-for-number-one">Shortly later, the label dropped McKee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - but not before in frustration she "drove to the label CEO's house in the middle of the night, took a CD of my best songs and stabbed it into a tree right in front of his door with a dagger. I then wrote 'Platinum Baby!' in lipstick on his car." When years later she broke out as a successful songwriter for hire (mostly for her friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a>), McKee admitted learning the machinations of the music industry at such a young age served as a cautionary tale.
</li><li> Despite being the most successful solo female singer of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> Era of the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">1960's</a>, with hits like "It's My Party", "Judy's Turn To Cry", "Maybe I Know", "She's A Fool" and proto-feminist anthem "You Don't Own Me", the late singer Lesley Gore was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> only given $16,000 in advance money by her label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercuryRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercuryRecords">Mercury Records</a> in 1963 for the success of "It's My Party", and no more royalties for her music until 1989<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3s1t6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3s1t6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3s1t6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mercury, then having changed hands with management, also paid off a $175,000 debt she acquired at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a></span>. Apparently, this was a result of her agents failing to meet a deadline to file audit papers in 1963, and Mercury's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">contract with Gore stipulating in a clause</a> that her agent would no longer be allowed to audit after that year. Partly due to this, and Gore realizing early on of the "fickleness" of success, she enrolled in college in 1965 to study American English and history as her career began a slight downswing, only sporadically doing personal appearances and recording around her school schedule for Mercury until her contract ended in 1968. She would maintain, in spite of this, that she was "one of the lucky ones".
</li><li> The founding of Drum Corps International is a result of this trope. Prior to DCIs founding, the major shows were governed by the American Legion and VFW. Corps directors wanted more control of the activity. This included a more equitable distribution of the shows proceeds among the corps (under the VFW/AL, only the top corps received any contest money), uniform judging standards (the two veterans groups criteria often varied considerably and were subject to the whims of their directors), and greater artistic flexibility (the VFW/AL ruled that aspect of the activity with an iron fist). As a result, in 1971, a group of Midwest and Western directors led by Don Warren (Cavaliers) and Jim Jones (Troopers) founded The Combine to gain more control over the activity. One year later, they merged with the United Organization of Junior Corps (their East Coast counterpart, who formed under similar circumstances) to form DCI. They quickly gained firm control of the drum corps activity within a few years, while the VFW/AL became increasingly irrelevant, hosting their last major championships in the early 1980s.
</li><li> This trope is the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cimorelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cimorelli">Cimorelli</a> opted to go indie. Why? At first, they were discovered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IslandRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IslandRecords">Island Records</a>, one of UMG's labels, thanks to a daughter of one of the executives at Island who saw their covers one day on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and they signed them up. At first it was OK, but it was mostly limited to EP's and a few original songs here and there and they were even gaining ground slowly, to the point they even had one of their songs ("What I Do") be featured in commercials for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro">Hasbro</a>'s Doh-Vinci (which itself was short-lived) as well as having another song of theirs ("Come Over") as one of the songs featured in a new version of the Twister Dance toy, and even having at least two songs of their ("Made in America" and "That Girl Should be Me") played on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RadioDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RadioDisney">Radio Disney</a> at one point. But then came the pressure to be more than just themselves and to do more songs that don't really represent them, and they thankfully (and peacefully) left on good terms with the label, but it also had a side effect of the sisters (and the whole Cimorelli family) moving from Malibu to Nashville as of current. Only then they finally got a chance to release their much-awaited first album, <em>Up At Night</em>, after a long time wait from the fans, on their own (But through PledgeMusic at first; the same occurred for the second one, <em>Alive</em>, but got released on ITunes on May 5th, a few months after their February release on PledgeMusic).
</li><li> This is what went on behind the scenes in Melechesh around the time that <em>Enki</em> was recorded. After Yuri Rinkel was fired in 2013, the band had decided to retain the services of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorod">Samuel Santiago</a> on at least a session basis. While it is unclear whether Santiago was supposed to become full-time eventually or was just going to track the album, he did indeed play on it and recorded his tracks in Greece in the summer of 2014. Shortly after this, Santiago had some sort of major blowup with Murat Cenan, and Cenan decided to spite him by scrubbing all mentions of Santiago from the album credits and hastily concocted a story about original drummer Lord Curse returning to track the album before making the rest of that lineup sign a contract stating that they were to not speak of Santiago's involvement and were to refer to Saro Orfali (aka Lord Curse) as the album drummer. While it was no secret in that circle that Santiago was the actual drummer (Orfali, for one, wasn't even in Europe at the time of recording), the truth finally publicly came out in late 2017, when former bassist Scorpios Androctonus (who had notably refused to sign the contract) posted the story on Facebook and also posted screencaps of several extremely rude and hostile messages that he received from Orfali about the reveal.
</li><li> A lot of cynics think there's an element of this in play when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardShow">Award Shows</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">Award Snubs</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a> ran into trouble with this during their time at Epitaph Records, owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BadReligion">Bad Religion</a> guitarist Brett Gurewitz. When <em>Smash</em> became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>, The Offspring intended to stay on Epitaph for years and release more albums through them. Unfortunately, Gurewitz's ego got the better of him and tried to sell the masters to another label in order to get out of the royalty arrangement. Frontman Dexter Holland was enraged by this and the band decided to sign with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords">Columbia Records</a> just to get out of Epitaph's meddling, meaning they had to take a pay-cut in the process.
</li><li> <em>Behind the Music</em> dealt with this trope frequently in terms of individual artists/groups and eras of music. For example in "1981", a look at the launch of MTV points out that while it would soon give huge boosts to many artists — particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a> groups — it left behind many other performers. They might have been doing well up to that point on radio, album sales, etc. but weren't suited to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicVideo">Music Video</a> form because they were too old, too unphotogenic, too mellow, didn't skew young, etc. The given example in the episode is Christopher Cross, the performer who won Record, Album, <strong>and</strong> Song of the Year Grammy Awards early that year and would chart his second Number One single (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arthur">"Arthur's Theme"</a>) a few months afterward, but saw little MTV airplay due to his chosen genre (soft rock) and less-than-glamorous appearance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars">Bruno Mars</a>, of all people, faced this when he was initially trying to break into the music industry. Record labels wanted him to sing Latin pop because of his name (Peter Hernandez) and ethnic background (he is half-Puerto Rican).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage">Garbage</a> suffered from this once their label Almo was sold to the giant Universal. Executives pressured the band to go into "popular" directions, such as adding guest artists, that they refused, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">the overall indifference by the label</a> - third album <em>beautifulgarbage</em> suffered from a lack of promotion, not helped by being released in September 2001 - ultimately led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of <em>Bleed Like Me</em>, where the bad vibes translated into passive-aggressive conflicts and a general lack of direction. Says something the tour was cut short as Garbage decided to go on hiatus, and once reunited as independent artists, the musicians said the lack of expectations led to a more relaxed and productive approach. Singer Shirley Manson also had a solo album that went unreleased because the label did not agree with what she had done ("[Geffen] wanted me to have international radio hits and 'be the Annie Lennox of my generation'. I kid you not; I am quoting directly.").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS">BTS</a> has mentioned several times (including, most notably, the lyrics of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a> "Sea") the struggle of being a Korean idol group from a small company. In Korea, the power and connections of an idol company are a massive factor in your success as an idol, with quick releases and constant promotion through music shows, variety shows and other TV shows being practically obligatory in order to make yourself known or (in the case of music shows) debuting at all. In an industry (at the time) ruled by the 3 biggest idol companies, BTS only managed to get their debut show by luck (after another group left their slot open), and, as many other small company artists, had later performances cut from broadcast.
<ul><li> On the Western side, part of the reason BTS' songs <a class="urllink" href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200313000620">have gotten little to no airplay in US radio stations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (no matter how radio-friendly they are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21158499/bts-on-hot100-chart-position-record">or how high they debut on charts in spite of this lack of airplay<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) is not for lack of requesting, but - as fans have found and radio stations have stated - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto">BTS' songs not being in English</a> and a lack of radio promotions (difficult to do if you only go to the US while on tour), with <a class="urllink" href="https://ew.com/music/2019/03/28/bts-exclusive-cover-story/">the members stating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> their refusal to change their identity just to chart in the US. This lack of radioplay (along with scarce or inconsistent playlisting in digital music platforms) is also credited as a major factor for BTS' songs free-falling on the Hot100 chart after the first week. This is further examined <a class="urllink" href="https://nowthisnews.com/pop/radio-why-wont-you-play-bts">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The portrayal by media of BTS' success as not the success of a single group, but of a faceless "Kpop wave", or as simply occupying the place left by One Direction, or as popularity that only exists in social media (all despite BTS having the second highest global sales in 2018 according to the IFPI and getting 3 #1s in Billboard 200 in less than a year), with the fandom being portrayed as only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto">teens who just like the pretty faces</a> (instead of the diverse and very lyric-invested fandom it actually is) certainly doesn't help matters, with awards shows supposedly based on popularity only nominating BTS in categories such as "Best Fandom" or <em>creating</em> new ones such as "Best Kpop" while keeping them away from the main awards.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists">United Artists</a> divested their record label to EMI, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> manager Don Arden moved distribution of his Jet Records label to CBS (along with ELO and the rest of Jet's roster) to avoid meddling by the new owners (and for good reason, since he had butted heads with EMI before and it was due to the feud that he jumped ship to UA in the first place). Big mistake: UA still had warehouses of unsold copies of ELO's albums, including the recently-released <em>Out of the Blue</em>, and EMI decided to dump them in the cutout market both to spite Arden and to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">make as much profit off ELO before the rights lapsed</a>. Arden and CBS tried to sue EMI to stop the practice, but weren't successful. It's not an uncommon sight to see many late 70's issues of ELO albums pre-<em>Discovery</em> have visible slits on the covers because of this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston">Boston</a> couldn't release another album after <em>Don't Look Back</em> for <em>eight years</em> thanks to a lengthy lawsuit from CBS, who wanted the group to rush out an album under their specified time-frame and were upset when that deadline wasn't met. During the lawsuit, new material continued to be recorded, but couldn't be released due to the lawsuit. It wasn't until the court ruled in Boston's favor that the group managed to sign with MCA to get <em>Third Stage</em> on the market, using said material as the album's basis.
