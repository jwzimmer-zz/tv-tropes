</p><p>Instead, they engineer a situation in which someone else will be forced to do it for them. The "classic" scenario involves a criminal indiscriminately attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystanders</a> or police so that they will be forced to shoot. More sympathetic characters, however, will simply pull an unloaded gun or realistic toy gun on a police officer and hope they respond with lethal force. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">In real life, it is fairly common</a>: at least one study showed that about a third of officer-involved shootings in the US are suicide-by-cop attempts (the numbers might be substantially off  statistics on officer-involved shootings in the US are notoriously sketchy  but the numbers probably aren't that far off and the point that this is surprisingly common still stands).

Avoiding this is why you never touch or move threateningly at a police officer, you <em>never</em> make movements that could be seen as reaching for a weapon around cops, and why you never brandish or carry a prop or fake weapon (much less a real one) in a way that suggests immediate use when one could <em>possibly</em> come into contact with police. (If you carry fake or prop weapons in public, you're advised to make them look safe at first glance with proper paint/markings/other "safety bonding," and openly carried firearms in areas where it's legal to open carry should be holstered in closed holsters.)

This has really happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>  it was a popular method used by really desperate Scandinavians and Germans in a time when suicide was considered an unforgivable sin.

<ul><li> Rukia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> viewed the possibility of being executed as this, since she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight">Failure Knight</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">had to kill</a> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> and first love when he was taken over by a Hollow. Ichigo, Orihime, Ishida, Chad and Yoruichi disagree, and ultimately they rescue her and show her that she's loved and deserving to live through.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has Lelouch and Suzaku playing this, with Lelouch as the victim and Suzaku as the cop. This is the last part of Lelouch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a>. What's more, Suzaku becomes Zero (Lelouch's alternate persona) from that moment, so effectively, Lelouch <em>does</em> kill himself. He also uses one legend he created (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Lelouch the tyrannical Emperor</a>) to reinforce the other one (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">freedom fighter Zero</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsJustTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDeathIsJustTheBeginning">pushing the entire world in the direction he wanted</a>. At the same time, this is a suicide played straight, as Lelouch crafted it after falling out of hope following Nunnally's apparent demise and the Black Knights' betrayal.
<ul><li> Suzaku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">general attitude</a> is this.
</li><li> Another example is when the Black Knights betray Lelouch. Lelouch, still grieving over Nunnally's apparent death and now cornered by Schneizel, pretends to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> and fakes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment with Kallen in order to get them to kill him and spare her.

</li><li> This is more or less what Soichiro Yagami ultimately does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. After his daughter Sayu is abducted and used to blackmail him, after he's forced to choose between surrendering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> to the Mafia or sacrificing his life and hers, he chooses to take the shinigami eyes and halve his life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out he didn't have that long to live, regardless</span>.
</li><li> Beelzemon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> attempts this; during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a>, he walks up to a group of Digimon whose friends he'd slaughtered earlier and stands there. Eventually they notice and attack him, and while he's obviously in pain, he doesn't even try to fight back despite being able to kill them all in seconds. After they spare him and leave him for dead he simply lies there, and when Renamon and Rika show up looking for him he essentially tells them to let him die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Son Goku wants rather to be killed by an powerful enemy humanity than die in his bed because of a disease, even if the enemy would continue to slaughter humanity. And if he's killed by an enemy, it really has to be during a fight that excited him, not when he's in his weakest and in front of his family (especially when the enemy kills his family and friends).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenItsAnEndlessWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenItsAnEndlessWorld">Eden: It's an Endless World!</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> example. A girl in a skyscraper full of people holding a bomb about to explode tries to throw it through a window. However, the window does not open, and she is out of bullets. She then threatens the police with her empty gun, so that they will shoot her, destroy the window, and send her falling outside with the bomb.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, heavily implied to be at least part of the motive of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Zeref. He's cursed so that he can't die of old age and that the more he cares about other living things, the more uncontrollably his magic kills everything around him. He spent the past 400 years hiding in exile while caring about life to minimize damage - then he met the protagonist, who he knows is the only one with the potential to be strong enough to kill him. Immediately afterwards he convinces himself to stop caring about life, leave exile and start doing homicidal things - conveniently ensuring that the emotionally-driven protagonist will feel motivated to put him out of his misery.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, this turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Berserker's (AKA Sir Lancelot) motivation for obsessively targeting Saber. Since Arturia never punished Lancelot for his affair with Guinevere, Lancelot felt that the only way for him to be redeemed was Saber killing him as Berserker</span>.

It's also a narrow-focused case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery">Put Them All Out of My Misery</a>, with the "them all" in this case being the other Homunculi. Throughout the fight he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">unsubtly shows Ed all the steps needed to kill a Homunculus</a> so he would be ready to the same to Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Sloth, Pride, Wrath, and ultimately Dante herself when the time came.

</li><li> In the 2018 anime series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GeGeGeNoKitaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GeGeGeNoKitaro">GeGeGe no Kitarō</a></em> that's the fate of Kani-Bōzu, a yōkai once tasked to protect a princess in ancient times. He failed and got sealed for centuries: upon waking up, he gets to a rampage in the close town of <em>Sakaiminato</em>, hoping for someone to put him out of his misery and lay him to rest along with his ward. Kitarō has to oblige his wish, but still turns his body to a bronze statue, places him to guard the princess' grave for all the eternity and has several statues of benign yōkai casted to keep him good company.
</li><li> Carris tries this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">Gundam X</a></em> after a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>, pointing at Garrod with an empty gun to trick the other into shooting him dead. It works insofar as getting Garrod to shoot him, but it's not fatal and Garrod immediately gets the ship's doctor to help.

</li><li> And averted spectacularly in another episode, "Murder 2.0", where the protagonists run into a hostage situation that looks to be the hostage-taker trying to commit suicide by cop... until Gibbs realizes that she's being forced by the "hostage" to "threaten" him with an unloaded weapon, and what's really going on is that the "hostage-taker" was being set up for a <em>Homicide</em> by Cop. Fortunately, it doesn't work.
</li><li> A clear example of this occurs in "Dead Man Talking" where the villain, standing right in front of Gibbs, who has his gun trained on her, attempts to shoot Gibbs anyway and gets shot in the head.
</li><li> Subverted in another episode, where a drugged up guy pulls a gun on the team after being chased, only for Gibbs to come up behind him and pin him to a railing. From the other side.

Constable Lam didn't fall for it and arrested him cleanly. Later, Lam shrugged off the praise for his restraint as just doing his duty.
</li><li> The German U-boat commander Werner Henke was captured by the Americans in 1944. His captors gave him a choice: Cooperate with them (potentially helping to kill his comrades); or be handed over to the British, who had accused him of war crimes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Instead</a> he walked up to the prison camp fence, in broad daylight and full view of the guards, and started climbing. Officially he was killed trying to escape (Which raises the question of where he was trying to escape to — the camp was on the outskirts of Washington DC), but historians agree that he simply chose that as a more honourable end than being hanged as a war criminal.
