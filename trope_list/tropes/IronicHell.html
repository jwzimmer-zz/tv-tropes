</li><li> Several of the banishments in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> as well as some of the torments shown as Ai ferries her victims through the gates of Hell are ironic. For example, a banishment during season three has a victim being chased through a city by a 'Kaiju' sized Ai and then shrunk to the size of a bug in the boat to Hell. This victim had previously said that he would "become a big man and throw (his) weight around." Or "The Two Prisoners", where the victim â€” a man who abandoned a girl he got pregnant â€” is shown both being drowned in amniotic fluid as a giant unborn baby watches and undergoing his own inhuman pregnancy.
<ul><li> For that matter, Ai's own servitude as the Hell Girl is also an ironic hell; as punishment for killing her village in an act of vengeance, and condemning her family to fall into the pits of hell if she does not pay their ransom, she's doomed to take vengeance on other people's behalf and, in doing so, condemning both her clients and targets to fall into the pits of hell.

The Elric brothers, who tried to bring back their mother, are both punished with loss: Ed, the eldest, had to deal with almost losing his brother, while Al is soul-bound to a suit of armour, unable to feel physical sensations and condemned to spend hours alone while everyone else sleeps.

<ul><li> One example of a combined Ironic Hell and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">Self-Inflicted Hell</a> is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatDreamsMayCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatDreamsMayCome">What Dreams May Come</a></em>, clearly based on Dante. The protagonist's wife committed suicide, and reflecting the selfish nature of the act, she is essentially trapped in a state of depression, unable to connect with others. Perhaps even more ironic, for the protagonist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he would rather be trapped in her Hell than his heaven without her. His doing so, however, makes her hell...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell">not</a>. Freeing both.</span>
</li><li> One of (at least) two possible explanations for the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JacobsLadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JacobsLadder">Jacob's Ladder</a></em> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "If you're frightened of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">dying</a>, and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. If you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the Earth." </span>
</li><li> The film <em>Between Two Worlds</em> posits that everyone goes to the same place when they die, and whether it's hell or heaven depends on whether they're the kind of person that would be happy living a pleasant, wholesome existence. Except for people who committed suicide, who are doomed to staff the cruise ship that carries the rest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scrooge1970" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scrooge1970">Scrooge (1970)</a></em> has a sequence where, after falling into his own grave, Scrooge ends up in Hell and is taken to a freezing cold office just like the one he made Bob Cratchit work in.
</li><li> The Spanish movie <em>Sin noticias de Dios</em> features a hell where everything takes on a reddish hue, but apart from that, the main punishment is your social standing being inverted. One of the characters is a notorious mobster who has been consigned to spend his life in Hell as a waitress. Oh, and the national language of Hell is English.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney">Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</a></em> featured this when the boys accidentally wind up in hell and locked in a maze-like corridor featuring their worst fears. (For Bill: It was getting kissed by old granny. Ted: Being chased by the Easter Bunny for stealing his brother's Easter basket as a child. For Both: Having to deal with a Military General pushing them to the brink (which was a reference from the first film)). Luckily, challenging Death bails them out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> features this with Darth Vader. He betrayed the Jedi to learn how to prevent death. His death is prevented, in the most painful way imaginable.
<ul><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">Rule of Symbolism</a>: As Anakin Skywalker, his greatest flaw was his impulsiveness. His emotions pretty much dictated his actions and almost always led to tragedy. As Darth Vader, he is more machine than man. Punishment for letting his emotions run wild is to be turned into an emotionless robot.
<ul><li> Possibly worse: he still has emotions, it's just that the dominant one is <em>self-hatred</em>. He even gets an almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft-worthy</a> effect where he can use the Dark Side to temporarily recover his ability to breathe unaided â€” but the momentary pulse of joy he feels as a result disrupts his concentration far enough that his condition immediately reasserts itself. Yet more reasons to be glad you're not Darth Vader.
</li><li> A comic panel had him "at peace" in the chamber on the <em>Executor</em>. Instead of peace he sees <strong>Padme</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">The Lost Lenore</a> and is shown that he only has his grief when he's alone.

To say anything about the film plotwise would be a major spoiler <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because nothing happens for the whole film besides scare chords and hysterical breathing</span> but the most terrifying moment of the film arguably comes at the very end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when you realize the doomed mother isn't alone and there are literally <em>millions</em> of people in sealed rooms suffering ironic punishments based on their life crimes just like she is.</span>

It's just a slightly more drab copy of Earth, and people's lives are just slightly worse than the ones they left behind- the ones that were bad enough to drive them to suicide in the first place.

After he's marooned on the island, he has nothing <em>but</em> time.

<ul><li> There's a joke: Joe lived a wild life, so he wasn't surprised to die and go to hell. He finds himself in a nightclub with no exit. The music is lousy, but he notices all the other patrons have a bottle of booze and a blonde gal for company. He comments on how great this looks, and the guy at the next table says 'Don't be so happy; the bottle has a hole in it, and the blonde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">doesn't</a>!'
<ul><li> A similar joke (which has multiple variations) has a guy go to the afterlife and witness other men being manacled to hideous women for all eternity. When it's his turn, he finds that he's being manacled to a beautiful blonde instead. The punchline is that it's punishment for <em>her</em>, not him.
</li><li> Another joke (which can feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> figures for parody): a man dies, goes to Hell and gets to choose between three different punishments. The last room he sees is a man having sex with a beautiful woman. He says that he wants <em>that</em> one, naturally, so Satan turns toward the coital couple and says, "(Woman's name), your replacement is here!"
</li></ul></li><li> Another one has Bill Gates asked to choose between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">Fluffy Cloud Heaven</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime">A Hell of a Time</a>. He takes the latter, but two weeks later he's in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a>. "That was Hell 1.0. This is Hell 95." (Or: "This is the real Hell. That was just the demo version.")
<ul><li> Or "the screen saver". Bill Gates <em>really</em> attracts this kind of thing.
</li><li> Another variant featured a politician, with the initial form being campaigning, and the actual hell being the results of the vote.
</li><li> Lawyers have a variant with the punchline "That was our summer program."
</li><li> The oldest version seems to be tourism vs immigration.
</li><li> Military recruiters. "Now, you're in."
</li><li> Undergrads vs grad students. Undergrads vs med students. Undergrads vs law students. Grad students vs post-docs. New MD vs residents. Etcetera.
</li></ul></li><li> Another joke: A priest that firmly believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil">Sex Is Evil</a> had a disciple. The priest died and sometime later, the disciple died too. At the afterlife, the disciple saw the Priest with a gorgeous woman at his lap.
<div class="indent"> <em>Master</em> he cried Â– <em>I see that God appreciated your sacrifices on earth, and now you will be rewarded with paradiseÂ’s pleasures!</em>
</div><div class="indent"> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool">You Fool!</a></em> Â– answered the priest Â– <em>In the first place, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsntHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsntHeaven">This Isn't Heaven</a>! And in the second, I am not being rewarded, she is being punished!</em>
</div></li><li> Another old joke: An avid fisherman dies and goes to the great fishing hole in the sky, where his guide informs him that he's required to catch any fish that jumps. But after catching several dozen identical trout, the fisherman gets tired and remarks, "You know, this isn't quite what I expected from heaven." The guide replies, "Who said this was heaven?"

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">Â Â Â Â LiteratureÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A humorous example from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books is the punishment given to the villain Mr. Pin near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>. When he and his (somewhat more sympathetic) partner, Mr. Tulip, are trapped in a burning cellar, he kills Mr. Tulip to use his body as a stepping-stone to escape - "I wasn't born to fry!" - and for good measure steals the potato that Mr. Tulip wears as a talisman, believing it will guarantee him reincarnation instead of eternal punishment. When he meets his own death, Mr. Pin <em>is</em> reincarnated - as a potato, of a variety noted as being good for frying. (Meanwhile, the antique-loving Mr. Tulip is also reincarnated, thanks to his "potato of the mind", as a woodworm, living an idyllic life in an antique desk.)
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric">Eric</a></em> also played with this one. Hell has recently come under new management, so the traditional punishments get scrapped in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">mind-numbing eternal boredom</a>. The Sisyphus stand-in has to read a book on the correct manner of rolling rocks up hills, for example. A book consisting of at least 10,000 tomes. Even the demon carrying out the punishment feels sorry for him; in fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the majority of demons eventually conspire to have the current ruler of Hell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> into a powerless job because they're sick of inflicting the new punishments.</span>
<ul><li> Ironically, the lost souls couldn't feel any pain in hell as they had no bodies, leading to a friendly rapport being developed with the demons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, a rat catcher is killed and discovers that he is due to be reincarnated - as a rat. He doesn't even believe in reincarnation, but it's made clear that <em>reincarnation believes in him</em>.

<ul><li> The damned in <em>Inferno</em> are all punished by tortures that have the same effect their sins have on their souls. A partial list:
<ul><li> The lustful, who were unable to control their sexual urges, are now unable to control anything as they are whirled about in a violent wind.
</li><li> The gluttonous, who degraded themselves for their appetites, are trapped in putrid mud representing the garbage they produced in life.
</li><li> Murderers, who spilled their neighbors' blood while alive, are forever submerged in the (boiling) blood of the Phlegethon.
</li><li> Suicides are transformed into trees. Having voluntarily rejected the body and life that God gave them, they no longer have humanoid form and never will, even when all other souls are resurrected (instead, their bodies will just hang on their tree forms).
</li><li> Flatterers are immersed in excrement, representing all the degraded and base flatteries they told on Earth.
</li><li> Simoniacs, who perverted the meaning of the church by selling holy things for mortal money (the sin is named after Simon the Magus, who offered the apostles money if they would teach him the 'magic' that they did), are punished in an inversion of baptism â€” stuck upside-down in holes resembling baptismal fonts with flames burning at their feet (instead of water being poured over one's head in baptism).
</li><li> Sorcerers and fortunetellers, who attempted to use fraudulent means to see the future, have their heads turned backwards so they <em>cannot</em> see what's in front of them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt politicians</a> are immersed in boiling pitch, representing the 'sticky fingers' and dark secrets of their corruption.
</li><li> Hypocrites wear gilded lead robes (that look like a monk's habit, for extra irony points). These look nice and shiny on the outside but are in reality dull and heavy, like the hypocrites' own falsity.
</li><li> Those who caused strife and division around them are themselves divided â€” by being hacked up by a demon.
</li><li> Falsifiers, who gained from alterations of various sorts, are afflicted by diseases that make them unrecognizable.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the penitent in <em>Purgatorio</em> suffer through trials that parallel their sins:
<ul><li> The wrathful are plunged into perfect darkness, making them as blind as their anger had made them.
</li><li> The avaricious lie flat on their faces and stare at the Earth all day as punishment for being obsessed with the earthly treasure of wealth.
<div class="indent"><em>"Just as we did not lift our eyes on high but set our sight on earthly things instead, so justice here impels our eyes toward earth."</em>
</div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Danish series <em>DjÃ¦vlens LÃ¦rling</em> ("The Devil's Apprentice") has a completely ironic Hell.

</li><li> The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Absurdism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Absurdism">absurdist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus">Albert Camus</a> wrote an essay on the topic and came to the conclusion that while at first, it might seem like an eternal punishment, from an absurdist perspective, Sisyphus should be happy because he has a clear purpose and direction. Since he always has a goal, he is thriving on the hope and anticipation of achieving it. For example, one is happier anticipating when they're going on vacation than when the day actually arrives.
</li><li> One short story from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> gives an alternate reason why Sisyphus doesn't give upâ€”he's tied to the area by an invisible leash that stops him when he tries to leave. When Thalia offers to roll the boulder for him so Percy can get information out of him for the current quest, she later notes that, near the end, she was confident that she could get it to stay, and was even tempted to try again when it slipped, certain that she could get it with another try.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> itself, Lazarus, a beggar, begs a rich man to help him and give him something to eat, and the rich man refuses him. When the rich man dies, he is in Hell and begs Abraham for water and he is then refused.
</li><li> A religious parable of unknown origin has the protagonist shown a vision of Hell in which everyone is eternally seated at a table filled with delicious-smelling food. However, none of them can eat a bite because they can't bend their elbows (or, in another version, their forks are far too long to reach their mouths). The protagonist then sees a vision of Heaven where the same banquet and same anatomical (or cutlery) restrictions apply, but everyone is feasting happily. Why? Because unlike the people in Hell who think only of themselves, the people in Heaven feed each other. (Depending on your sensibilities, this is either heartwarming or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMoment">Golden Moment</a>.)

(With some cheating and stealing, of course; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHonorAmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHonorAmongThieves">this is Hell.</a>) So war criminals go to the battlefields of Gehenna, media drones to the mindlessness of Perdition, and those who obsessed over technology become experimental subjects in the labs of Tartarus, for example.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> campaign setting takes place largely inside a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor Made</a> Ironic Hells (called "domains" with the condemned being a "darklord"); the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a> of the setting seem to take delight in this. For instance, a bloodthirsty conqueror is trapped in a world where he finds every attempt to expand thwarted. A wizard-king who committed unspeakable crimes in order to live forever so he could master all magic did indeed achieve lichdom... but can't learn any new spells. A wererat who murdered her grandfather and intensely distrusts her family also suffers from monophobia, preferring to keep even enemies around rather than being alone, etc. etc. The best part is that the domains wouldn't suck so much if the darklords simply acknowledged that they were bad people who did bad things and that their misery is their own damn fault. But most of them just can't work up the strength of character needed to do that â€” and if they could, they probably wouldn't have become darklords in the first place.
<ul><li> An interesting case would be Lord Soth: the Dark Powers apparently just gave up on him and ejected him. Why? He had become so apathetic that his torments just didn't matter to him anymore (also because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">the third-party licensor couldn't use him</a>). Prior to this, however, his fate was a refinement of the Ironic Hell he was <em>already enduring</em> on Krynn, where he was cursed to spend most of his unliving existence in a castle haunted by his dead wife and full of ghosts reciting his sins for all eternity. In Ravenloft, because Soth was also something of a perfectionist, the furniture and room sizes kept subtly shifting and the litany of his sins was full of minor continuity errors.
</li><li> The most iconic Darklord is probably Strahd. In life, he was jealous of his younger brother Sergei, and desired Sergei's betrothed, Tatianna. After selling his soul and murdering his brother, Strahd now spends his unlife chasing the reincarnations of Tatianna, who always are just out of reach. As an added bonus, Strand is cursed to always feel like Tatianna's deaths were because he made a mistake, and he might succeed next time. He never does. A twisted theory states that this punishment isn't Strahd's, but Tatianna's. What sin did she commit to deserve such a fate, I wonder...
</li><li> The Vistani, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalRomani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalRomani">Magical Romani</a>, have the power to invoke curses, which often take this form.

However, most times, the curse has some terrible side effect that cause pain and suffering to everyone <em>around</em> the intended victim, such as Jacqueline Montarri, who cut the head of a respected Vistana, and now has to use the heads of her victims while searching for her original, which just incentivizes her to kill <em>more</em> people. Vistani aren't that good judges of character, so they sometimes end up cursing people with something they'll enjoy. immensely.

Most are ironic â€” for example, the Lust ones remove any sex from the lives of the damned (except for Big Tease Shower Towers, that sparks it only to keep extinguishing it through supernaturally mood-ruining cold showers), the Sloth ones involve subjecting damned SOULs to forced labor, like 666 Pennants Over Perdition (where the damned are run ragged trying to keep the demonic customers happy at a carnival); and the Gluttony ones punish them with eating, from Taco Inferno (where everything, even the beverages, is hotter than melted silver) to Bahb's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding">All-U-Must-Eat</a>.

For bonus points, the Hunter's Nightmare is even based on Nakara, the Hell of Japanese Buddhism, with Yharnam's towering steeples taking the place of Naraka's iconic Needle Mountains, the classic River of Blood running through the Nightmare's valley and Ludwig, the boss preventing you from leaving the Nightmare, serving as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of Mezu, the horse-faced demon guarding the entrance to Naraka. Some of the characters in the Nightmare have their own unique twists:
</li><li> As noted, Ludwig, the first leader of the Healing Church Hunters, turned into possibly the most horrific Beast of them all. Not only that, his horrible Beast form resembles a monstrous centaur, possibly as a gross parody of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> image. He's situated at the entrance of the Nightmare, where he personally witnesses the Hunters that he sought to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">mould into honorable protectors</a> engaging in pointless bloodlust forever.
</li><li> Lady Maria participated in the massacre at the Fishing Hamlet (and possibly the death of Kos) and oversaw the Healing Church's immoral experiments using the information they gained from said massacre. It's implied she committed suicide over it. The Nightmare has her trapped in the top floor of the Healing Church's research hall, in the same position that she died, right in front of a door leading to the evidence of her original atrocity. She's desperate to prevent any visitors from finding it.
</li><li> It's heavily implied that Gehrman, who led the original raid on the Fishing Hamlet, is somehow linked to the soul of the Orphan of Kos, who his Hunters cut from his mother to be experimented on, causing Gehrman great torment. Once you slay the Orphan, the Doll notes that Gehrman seems a lot calmer and happier when he sleeps.
</li><li> Laurence, the First Vicar, gets it the worst of all. He spread the Beastly Scourge via pedaling Great One blood as a miracle cure in order to increase the power of the Healing Church, which he headed. When Beast outbreaks began to occur, he had his Hunters brutally suppress them and even massacred and set fire to Old Yharnam to both keep the Scourge contained and keep the cause of it a secret. So in the Nightmare, he has not only been transformed into a horrible beast himself, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">perpetually on fire</a>.

</li><li> Fittingly, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3">the third game</a>, it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the children finally killed the Murderer by scaring him into the Spring Trap suit, which then malfunctioned and crushed him to death.

Of course, the Boss is <em>such</em> a violent sociopath ("<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Puckish rogue!</a></em>") that he/she quickly shakes off his/her new wholesome persona and starts causing havoc again, so Zinyak alters his/her simulation to that of modern Steelport where the Saints have lost control of the city to the Zin.

<ul><li> In the fourth Halloween special of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Homer spends a day in Hell. Since he sold his soul for a doughnut, Homer is force-fed "all the doughnuts in the world" as punishment. Much to the frustration of the demon torturing him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">Homer thoroughly enjoys the experience and even asks for more doughnuts when he's done</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Demon:</strong> I don't understand it. James Coco went mad in fifteen minutes!
</div><ul><li> This is explicitly shown to be in the "Hell Labs' Ironic Punishment Division", so presumably it's happening to everyone else there.
</li><li> The doughnut sequence is a reference to the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short <em>Pigs Is Pigs</em>, where a young pig who steals a slice of pie dreams he's force-fed to the point of explosion.

Ya dig?"
</li><li> In a living example, in another Halloween episode, Homer goes back to the past and accidentally changes history, and spends the rest of the episode repeatedly going back to the past and changing different things in an effort to return to his own timeline. He eventually arrives in a timeline that is much <em>better</em> than his own: his family is filthy rich, his kids are well-behaved, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">Patty and Selma</a> are dead. Naturally, he decides to stay there... until he asks for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">donuts</a>, and discovers to his horror that they apparently don't exist in this timeline, since Marge has never heard of them before. He immediately hurries back to the past to try another timeline. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaveUpTooSoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaveUpTooSoon">Mere seconds after he leaves</a>, donuts start falling from the sky en masse and Marge becomes annoyed that "it's raining again".

</li><li> Defied in the episode "Ready, Willing and Disabled", where Joe being unable to catch up to a fleeing criminal due to his paraplegia eventually leads to the events of the rest of the episode revolving around Joe competing in the Special Olympics. By the end, the episode is bookended by Joe chasing the exact same criminal and managing to subdue him by landing on top of him. Later, he mentions how he accidentally landed on him in such a way as to sever his spinal cord, but when Peter jokes about him being his future rival in the next Olympics, Joe responds with a flat "Nope, he's dead."

<ul><li> In "Squidville," Squidward decides to move to Tentacle Acres after Spongebob and Patrick destroy his house. Squidward enjoys the fact that he lives in such close proximity to people that share his passions and tastes, but eventually becomes bored of his new routine, and decides to act like Spongebob and eventually escape.
</li><li> In "The Algae's Always Greener," Plankton creates a device that allows him to travel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">another reality</a> where he is the owner of the Krusty Krab, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIngredient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIngredient">the secret Krabby Patty recipe.</a> Although he is happy at first, he decides to go back to his reality when he experiences firsthand what Krabs has to endure to keep the restaurant afloat.
</li><li> In "Ghoul Fools", an evil pirate ghost traps Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and Squidward in dark voids where they'll be eternally tormented for trying to steal his gold. Mr. Krabs, being a greedy cheapskate, is placed in a void where he can only relieve himself by using a pay toilet; Patrick, being a glutton, has a talking donut who will always move out of his reach placed onto his head (although this quickly turns into eternal torment for the donut, since Patrick can't decide if he even likes donuts that much, and keeps forcing it to add toppings to itself or transform into other foods); and finally, Squidward is placed on the nose of a giant SpongeBob, to his own lack of surprise.
<ul><li> And then it turns out the pirate ghost stole gold from the Flying Dutchman who dishes out his own Ironic Hell: everyone stuck in a dark void working in the Krusty Krab for all eternity with demons and ghosts as the customers.
