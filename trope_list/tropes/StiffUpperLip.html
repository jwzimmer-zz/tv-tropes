<ul><li> And their reaction to Caesar applying his tactical genius and attacking at five o'clock every day and all day for two days every five days? "I say. They really aren't gentlemen!"
</li><li> Anticlimax even asks Asterix to "Be brave and keep a stiff upper lip" when the Romans capture Obelix.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em> album <em>The Tenderfoot</em>, British gentleman Waldo Badminton inherits a Western farm. Keeping a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a> through the various tribulations the locals put him through, the story ends with a duel. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> shoots first... but seems to miss, and when Waldo calmly stands still, not so much as reacting to being shot at, he gives up in terror. Then it is revealed Waldo <em>was</em> hit in the arm, and is in not only in great pain but also unable to lift his weapon. He just didn't want to show it and make a fuss.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> storyline "Judgement Day", when the various megacities around the world are being overrun with zombies, the British judges report in as "surrounded but defiant".

<div class="indent"><strong>Skrull:</strong> You think that is bravery? Tiny things! Within the Skrull Empire, you will know grandeur. You will know pride and determination and... <br/><strong>Captain Britain:</strong> I think you'll find we know already. We just don't like to make a fuss.

In #4, his costume becomes sentient and starts acting out his subconscious feelings. American superheroes with this problem typically solve it by acknowledging these feelings and getting them into the open where they can be dealt with. The Knight solves it by <em>repressing them even further</em>.

Quatermain contemptuously counters that it's nothing of the sort, it's just everyone is denying the gravity of the situation until it's too late.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhenTheWindBlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhenTheWindBlows">When the Wind Blows</a></em> and its animated adaptation heavily deconstructs this (as well as being a serious criticism of the leaflets handed out at the time by the British government on precautions to surviving a nuclear bombing), in that being they were basically useless because ''there's no way to survive), although it's partly because the elderly British couple is very naive to the nature of the nuclear holocaust. They try to remain calm and continue their normal activities, believing it to not be any different from the Blitzkriegs of World War II, and that eventually, help will come. However, it's abundantly clear to viewers that no help will ever come, as everyone else is dead, but the couple remains optimistic <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even as the radioactive fallout is killing them</span>.

While the real man refused to show fear in front of his men, including never running between cover, the actor Anthony Hopkins couldn't force himself to walk while fake explosions were all around him and couldn't fathom how the real man could do so in the face of real bombs.

He then indignantly forbids his colleagues from using a bottle of single malt to keep the generator going, and the three of them raise a glass as the superstorm descends and the power goes out.

However, he considers the pose to be an act because before and after the danger he's imagining the horrific consequences of getting shot or blown up or otherwise mutilated in battle.

<ul><li> This was literally military doctrine for British officers: The earliest written reference of it is in the 1727 book "A Treatise of Military Discipline: In Which is laid down and Explained the Duties of Officer and Soldier", which states officers should carry themselves in a serene and affable manner to help embolden their troops. Many real examples displayed this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">walking calmly and never ducking</a> in the face of bullets, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerDeadpan">being unerringly polite whenever they spoke</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog">possibly of chatting about the weather</a>). While this concept was generally used among other Western armies of the time, true to the trope, none carried it out to the extent of the British. There was some advancement to this along with the rest of warfare's increasing lethality (for example, the officers of skirmishers in the 18th century were allowed to kneel while their troops lied prone, and in World War I, could take cover from artillery bombardment while in a trench), but the core concept remained - act like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnOfficerAndAGentleman">An Officer and a Gentleman</a> at all times.

He afterwards said all he could think about was his rage against Captain Nolan, who he thought had tried to take over the leadership of the charge from him. After cantering back up the valley, he considered he had done all that he could and, with astonishing sangfroid, left the field and went on board his yacht in Balaclava Harbor, where he ate a champagne dinner."

Another account from his aide-de-camp even states he made light of the situation by cracking a joke about how his playboy days were coming to an end (he was 47 years old at the time) and that it would be unfair for him to cut younger men out of the game for so long anyway.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The battle of Trafalgar involved sailing straight towards the flanks of the French and Spanish line in full view of their broadside, in order to get close enough to break up their formation and bring superior British gunnery skill and firepower to bear at close range in battle. During the approach, the wind faltered briefly and the 100-gun HMS <em>Royal Sovereign</em> became motionless in front of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet. Legend has it that as his ship was being fired upon by several enemy ships, Collingwood, the Captain, turned to his First Officer and said, "Hopefully the fair wind will resume, or this may well take all day."

<ul><li> Indeed, a freakish coincidence occurred here—Collingwood, as the <em>Royal Sovereign</em> went into action (and thus, as shrapnel, musket balls, chain and bar shot, and cannon fire was whipping around him) said: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">What wouldn't Nelson give to be here</a>?" At almost exactly the same moment, Nelson, completely unconcerned with the perilous position of <em>Royal Sovereign</em>, said, "See how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into action!"
</li></ul></li><li> When Finnish national hero Marshal Mannerheim was caught in Russia during the Civil War, other officers disguised themselves to avoid being lynched by mutineers. He got himself up in a Czarist uniform dripping with gold lace, hired a relay of batmen to serve his needs, and rode the train home, daring every Bolshevik in Russia to shoot him. It takes more than the collapse of society to make a man of <em>his</em> station carry his own luggage.
</li><li> On the two occasions where, as head of state, Mannerheim was forced to shake hands with Adolf Hitler, he ordered his white gloves be incinerated afterwards as they were now too soiled to rescue. Declaring contempt for your forced ally — perceived as the lesser of two evils compared to Stalin — at a time when Germany was all-powerful needed balls.
</li><li> Another outstanding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> example: When British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747, flew through a cloud of volcanic ash over Indonesia on June 24, 1982, all four engines failed; the pilot's comment has gone down in the history of understatement: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get it under control. I trust you are not in too much distress." Amazingly enough, they later restarted and the aircraft landed safely. That is, after several attempts during a crash dive, they restarted three engines and landed safely despite the cockpit windows having been sandblasted by ash and rendered opaque.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2b0ku');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2b0ku" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2b0ku');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The captain compared the experience of this near-blind landing to "negotiating one's way up a badger's arse".</span>
</li><li> Another incident, this time from the Korean War: a British force was eventually forced to retreat, having received no reinforcements and being reduced to throwing tinned rations at the enemy. The commanding officer's report to his American superiors stated that things were "a bit sticky". The Americans, failing to recognize textbook British understatement, did not send the necessary support until after they died practically to the last man. The British troops numbered 600 and were facing a Chinese force numbering around 30,000. The Chinese lost 10,000 men while the British suffered only 59 KIA, though only 39 evaded capture.
</li><li> After the British ship HMS <em>Coventry</em> was hit by an Argentinian missile during the Falklands War of 1982 and was sinking, the crew awaiting rescue figured they might as well pass the time and started singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">"Always Look On the Bright Side of Life"</a>.

</li><li> The page image and "Keep Calm and Carry On" were both posters created during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, though "Keep Calm and Carry On" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">was never actually displayed during the war</a> because the government never thought the situation had gotten bad enough to warrant its use. It became a symbol of British character only after it was rediscovered in a second-hand bookshop in 2000.
</li><li> After the 7/7 London bombings, the website <a class="urllink" href="http://www.werenotafraid.com">We're Not Afraid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> popped up, with thousands of images sent in of various Brits displaying the message in various creative and simple ways. Reinforced by people queueing at the bus stop for the route which had been attacked the very next day. Very 'Keep Calm And Carry On', and especially notable for how it defied the official government and media response which was as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> had been declared.
<ul><li> One man, who lived through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, responded by saying, "I've been blown up by a better class of bastard than this."
</li><li> On that note, graphic novellist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> described the bombings as 'that little bit of bother on the 7th July'.
</li></ul></li><li> Noted by comedian Dara Ó Briain. On the 6th of July, we learnt we were getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics">The Olympics</a> in 2012 and the next day was the bombing — apparently everybody in London reacted the same to both pieces of news: "Oh... but how am I going to get home?"
<div class="indent"><strong>Dara Ó Briain:</strong> Oh, my god, there's a bomb on the Picadilly Line. <em>[beat]</em> Well, I can take the Victoria line. <em>[beat]</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">You know, that might actually be faster?</a>
</div></li><li> The '80s British prank show <em>Beadle's About</em> once staged an elaborate hoax alien invasion in a woman's back garden. How did she respond to a strange alien figure emerging from the wreckage of a UFO in the middle of her flowerbeds? Naturally, she asked the "alien" whether it would like a cup of tea.
</li><li> A firebomb went off in a cinema in Liverpool during WWII. Naturally, everyone assumed it was the Germans, and ran to the door. One man stood up and said, "Don't worry, it's only the Irish," who were fighting for independence. Everyone waited for the bomb to fizzle out, and continued watching the film.
</li><li> The entire life of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Daniel Wintle embodied this trope (along with a good portion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a>).
<ul><li> In his first action in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">WWI</a>, aged 16, he found himself frozen with fear under heavy machine-gun fire. Not knowing what else to do, he stood up, saluted, and sang the national anthem.
</li><li> In a later action, he was helping guide a horse pulling a gun when he suffered a near-direct hit from a German shell that destroyed his knee, blew off several of his fingers, and blinded him in one eye. His first words on waking in a military hospital? "Is the horse alright?" (It wasn't).
</li><li> He received the Military Cross for almost-singlehandedly capturing a village from the Germans and holding it for several hours until relieved. He later claimed to have no recollection of the action but admitted: "It does sound the sort of thing I'd do". While in the hospital he saw a young trooper of his regiment dying of Scarlet Fever. He pushed past the doctors to bellow at the unconscious man "Now look here. It's against Kings Regulations for a Dragoon to die in bed. Now I order you to stop dying <strong>AT ONCE!</strong> And when you do get up, get your bloody hair cut!". The man went on to make a full recovery and indeed outlived Wintle.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">WWII</a> he was arrested for attempting to steal a plane (in order to meet the leader of the French Air Force to arrange their defection to Britain in the event of a surrender, and having been refused the official loan of one despite threatening the Squadron Commander—and <em>himself</em> with his service revolver). The poor NCO assigned to escort him to prison (in the Tower of London no less) somehow managed to lose the arrest warrant. Ordering the NCO to wait for him at the station, Wintle returned to HQ to acquire a new warrant. Finding no more senior officer than himself there, <em>he signed his own arrest warrant</em>.
</li><li> After a short spell in the Tower, he was assigned to SOE and dropped behind the lines in France, where he was promptly betrayed by his contact and arrested by the Vichy French. In the French military prison, he routinely berated his guards for their slovenly appearance and went on hunger strike in protest at it, refusing to eat for 9 days until they paraded in their best uniforms. In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213052/">The Last Englishman,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic">biopic</a> about Wintle's career, it was revealed by Maurice Miola, the head of the garrison in which Wintle was imprisoned, that his sheer patriotism and fortitude had inspired all 280 men stationed there to join the Résistance after he'd been transferred to another prison.
</li><li> In civilian life, as well as always carrying a furled umbrella with a note inside saying "This umbrella stolen from AD Wintle" because while he believed no gentleman would ever leave home without an umbrella, no gentleman would ever actually unfurl one either. He also became the only person ever to successfully represent himself in a case before the Law Lords. The case in question, which involved a crooked solicitor, an inheritance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">and for which he had spent six months in Prison for ambushing said solicitor and forcing him to remove his trousers, which Wintle flew from his private flagpole</a> is actually now enshrined in precedent in England, to the effect that a solicitor may not be a beneficiary of a will he helped to draw up.
</li></ul></li><li> Vice Admiral David Beatty was in command of the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadron at the Battle of Jutland in World War I. During this engagement, his squadron lost two battlecruisers, with his own ship very nearly following due to an ammunition fire below deck. His comment after watching two of his ships catastrophically explode was "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today". He topped that with his next line: "Steer two points closer to the enemy." Beatty is not looked upon favorably today for his role in the battle, though no one can say he lacked for courage.
</li><li> Captain Edward Coverley Kennedy was commander of the armed merchant cruiser HMS <em>Rawalpindi</em>, which was essentially a passenger liner armed with guns. Such ships were good at fulfilling auxiliary duties that would otherwise tie up regular warships but were otherwise no match for anything that wasn't a small vessel like a frigate or a submarine. On November 23, 1939, the ship accidentally ran into the German battleships <em>Scharnhorst</em> and <em>Gneisenau</em>, which at the time were the <em>two most powerful warships in the entire German navy</em> and so dangerous that over the course of the war, the Royal Navy devoted considerable resources to destroy them. Hopelessly outgunned and unable to run away, the good captain rejected offers of surrender and decided to fight. His last wireless dispatch back to the base? "We'll fight them both, they'll sink us, and that will be that. Goodbye."
</li><li> Another story from the Royal Navy, this one from World War I. During both World Wars, Royal Navy deployed armed vessels disguised as merchant ships—known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Q-ships</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fv24');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3fv24" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fv24');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The largest battleships of the Wood and Sail era were known as Ships of the Line; the name comes from their main battle tactic, which was to form a long line of ships stem-to-stern, forcing enemy ships to pass to the left or right and endure heavy cannon broadsides. In common British parlance line = queue, therefore Queue Ships, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">har de har har it is to laugh</a></span>—to lure and attack German submarines. One of these, HMS <em>Dunraven</em>, was under attack by a submarine in 1917, and a fire broke out in a magazine just under a hidden gun which was standing by to open fire on the submarine if it got closer. After the gun blew up, the chief of the gun crew reported to the captain: "I am sorry, sir, for leaving my gun without orders. I think I must have been blown up."
</li><li> After the riots in 2011, many people's first response was to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-14459857">organize city-wide cleanups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Facebook and Twitter, then wake up at 8am the next day to meet and tidy up the affected areas.
</li><li> During the Battle of Britain, the Richmond Golf Club enacted temporary rules concerning the onslaught. The first of these: "Players are asked to collect Bomb and Shrapnel splinters to save these causing damage to the Mowing Machines."
</li><li> There is a several-hundred years-old tradition at the Tower of London, concerning the locking of the gates. It is known as the Ceremony of the Keys and has been carried out at the exact same time every day, in any and all weather, since at least the 14th Century. The only time it wasn't carried out on time was during World War II, when a stick of bombs hit very close to the Tower. The ceremony was delayed by a few minutes (the people responsible having been <em>blown off of their feet</em> by the shock waves of the explosives; a few extra minutes to dust off and recompose oneself afterwards is completely understandable), and the chief warder wrote a letter of apology for the delay to King George VI, who in turn wrote back saying, essentially, "not to worry, not your fault."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith_(sea_captain)">Captain Edward John Smith<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the <em>RMS Titanic</em>. Famous mostly for his (now considered apocryphal) line "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Be British</a>" and for going down with his ship.
</li><li> Last radio message from the British Parachute Battalion at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">Battle of Arnhem</a> "Out of ammunition. God save the King".
</li><li> The British were so confident in this trope that they even applied it to their nuclear doctrine. In the US, the commander of a nuclear missile equipped vessel has to go through "permissive action links", which means the support of his XO, the key weapons officers, and the President. Their launch keys, without which the missiles cannot be launched, are kept in safes which can only be unlocked via a combination which nobody aboard knows, and which comes with the President's launch order, which again must be confirmed by key personnel. In the UK, however, the Ministry of Defence didn't bother with this, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">"it would be invidious to suggest...that Senior Service officers would act in defiance of their stated orders." British captains disobey orders? Preposterous!</a>
<ul><li> This is because unlike America, the UK is close enough for there to be very little warning should Russia fire nuclear missiles. Hence, there would be no time for the Prime Minister to be properly briefed and issue orders.
</li><li> It was later revealed that the US Permissive Action Locks were all set to zero anyway because the people involved were already happy with their security and didn't want another layer getting in the way.
</li></ul></li><li> Princess Anne was almost kidnapped &amp; killed when a man forced himself into her car and said he was going to hold her hostage. Her response to this was to shout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">"Not bloody likely!"</a> and then get out of the other side of the car.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelCoward">Noël Coward</a> got in on the action: while his hotel was being bombed by Nazis, he entertained the guests with a night-long impromptu cabaret. When asked about the night afterwards, he joked that it was every entertainer's dream to have a literally captive audience.
</li><li> A Royal Navy officer undergoing "Perisher" (so called because failing it ends your submarine career there and then) - the prolonged series of tests to assess his fitness to command a submarine, in which one single slip means "goodbye" - was subjected to three days worth of grueling mock attacks in an escape and evasion exercise. A routine signal from the exercise controller at the end of this phase of the test asked him his opinion of his taste of command. He signaled back "Hebrews 13:8". In the King James Version of the Bible, that verse reads: "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever." Slightly re-arrange the punctuation and it neatly expresses the feelings of a browned-off submarine commander who has been evading sub-powered depth charges and other training weaponry for three days straight. (Apparently, they can't kill or damage a sub, but they still go off with a bit of a loud bang.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Hugh Laurie</a> lampooned this tendency when he appeared on <em>Inside The Actors' Studio</em>. After an enthusiastic reception, the first words out of Laurie's mouth were, "Good Lord, American audiences are <em>fantastic</em>. An English audience wouldn't make that amount of noise if the building was on fire."
<ul><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a> commented on this when she attended two premieres of the same film, one in America, one in the UK.
<div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> The British audiences come out and say, "Well, that was very good." The American way is, "THAT WAS <em>AWESOME</em>!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> The imitable Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Seton, HM 74th Highlanders:
<ul><li> HMS <em>Birkenhead</em> wrecked on 26 February 1852 off the coast of Africa. She wasn't carrying enough lifeboats for all her passengers; most of them were soldiers, who stayed aboard the ship to allow the women and children to take the lifeboats. This had never been done before. When the ship was going down, her captain told the soldiers to jump overboard and swim for the boats; Seton, realising that this would risk swamping the boats and killing the women and children, ordered the men to stand fast, and they almost universally did.
</li><li> In the word he chose for his orders on the <em>Birkenhead's</em> deck:
<div class="indent">When the Army complement mustered on deck, addressing his officers: "Gentlemen, would you please be kind enough to preserve order and silence among the men, and see to it that any orders given by Captain Salmond are instantly obeyed."
</div></li><li> And:
<div class="indent">The last order he was to give - when the <em>Birkenhead</em> began to sink in truth, and Captain Salmond told the men mustered on deck to swim for the boats and save themselves: "You will swamp the cutter carrying the women and children! I implore you not to do this thing and ask you all to stand fast!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> Horrifyingly subverted in Robert Falcon Scott's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">diary</a> during his ill-fated Antarctic expedition. After recounting the party's lack of food, isolation, and inability to go forward or back, he finishes with a flawlessly British: "It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more." But he then follows it with a final scrawl: "Last entry. For God's sake look after our people."
</li><li> During the 2017 London Bridge attack, a man was seen running down the street still holding his pint. When questioned about this, he responded he wasn't leaving it behind - it cost six pounds!
