They are dissolute, dissipated, degenerate, depraved — let's just sum it up as "decadent" — to such an extent that every thing they touch becomes corrupted.

</p><p>How the court got that way differs from story to story. More often than not, the source is at the top. They caught it from the monarch.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, it seems like all the major nobles in Midland are out to get Griffith, who ends up as the target of two assassination plots by the jealous nobility. Griffith, however, is no slouch himself, and all of the nobles who take part in the assassinations end up dead or blackmailed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBrideOfTheWaterGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBrideOfTheWaterGod">The Bride of the Water God</a></em>, both the Emperor's Court and the Court of the Water Kingdom are filled with intrigue and characters at cross-purposes. Of course, many of the characters are in both courts...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em>, the court of King Sweyn Forkbeard is said to be so opulent it is populated with beautiful slave women taken from every corner of the world, filled with conniving politicians, and the arena of many a bloody duel to the death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, bombs, poisons, abductions, gunfire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">suicides</a> are not unheard of in Imperial politics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em> is set in the Shogun's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem">harem</a>, which develops into a place of backstabbing maneuvers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, the Britannian Royal Court comes off as this, given the scheming nobles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">The Social Darwinist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Emperor</a>. The Chinese court has this as well, with the scheming Eunuchs being the Chinese counterpart to the Britannian nobles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordPrincessAltina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordPrincessAltina">Sword Princess Altina</a></em> is rife with this. Every royal court shown, regardless of country of origin, is filled with nobles or royalty constantly fighting, scheming, poisoning, or just plain sending armies after one another while vying for succession. Even Altina's own father, the Emperor of Belgaria, sent his 14-year-old daughter to the front lines just to be rid of her, and when she asked for a weapon, to defend herself, gave her a massive decorative sword, thinking she'd be unable to wield it.
</li><li> Being set at the eve of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles">Rose of Versailles</a></em> features the Court of Versailles, with her immense decadence and deadly enough that, during Louis XV's reign, Madame Du Barry, lover of the king, poisoned <em>one of her own maids to try and frame Marie Antoinette for it</em>, only for Oscar to hold her at swordpoint and remind her she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">antagonizing the future queen while her power depended from the health of a very old man</a>.
<ul><li> Versailles is especially contrasted to the Austrian Court, where the protocol was nowhere as rigid and the sober <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">Maria Theresa</a> would allow only the smallest amount of luxury and no deadly politicking. Some of Marie Antoinette's problems come from growing up there, resulting in her being initially too open and naive for Versailles' standards (and never fully growing out of her naivete) and being blinded by the magnificent opulency of the French court.

How this will all play out is yet to be seen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheLostKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheLostKing">The Lost King</a></em> the infighting between Garon's concubines has turned the Nohrian court into a hostile environment, even leading to the concubines murdering each other and their <em>children</em>. Garon's unable to stop the murders because he can't prove that the concubines are actually doing them, and he can't just send them away for fear of offending their families or provoking the self-made concubines into more overt actions of sabotage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Ripples" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Ripples">Ripples</a></em> and its sequel <em>Stirred</em> have a rare example where this is a <em>step up</em> from the alternative, as this version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">Phobos</a> cares more about keeping peace than having a iron grip on his power. He'd rather have some sketchy allies won over without violence than purge everyone untrustworthy.
</li><li> The court of Wuhan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheWeaverOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheWeaverOption">The Weaver Option</a></em> is so bad that there are multiple open murder attempts during the Governor's victory ball, <em>before</em> the coup attempt is launched.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OneDayAtATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OneDayAtATime">one day at a time</a></em>: Gotham's high society is portrayed as a subdued version of this, with various families (minor and major) all scheming over the course of several generations to eventually usurp the First Families, particularly the Waynes, and take control of their fortunes. Not helping the matter is that a fair number of those socialites are/were also members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Court of Owls</a>, who have been ruling Gotham from the shadows for centuries and are a large part of why the city is corrupt. In the first timeline, Jason Todd, upon becoming the official head of the Wayne Family, absolutely refused to involve himself in Gotham politics for several years outside holding an occasional charity ball for the Wayne Foundation almost explicitly because of this trope. It was only after the arrival of Helena Wayne, his father Bruce Wayne's only known living biological heir, that he finally started playing along — specifically to protect her and her inheritance.

<ul><li> Louis XVI's court as portrayed in the French movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ridicule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ridicule">Ridicule</a></em> exemplifies this trope, showcasing how nobles' political power and status is highly dependent on their wit. One victim of a mocking jest sees his request to the King rejected, gets ostracized and ends up killing himself as a result.
</li><li> Spoofed (among many other tropes) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCourtJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCourtJester">The Court Jester</a></em>.
</li><li> Speaking of our good friend Louis XVI, this is played for laughs in <em>History of the World Part I</em>. "It's good to be the king!"
</li><li> Par for the course in <em>Hamlet</em> adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegendOfTheBlackScorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegendOfTheBlackScorpion">Legend of the Black Scorpion</a></em>. Pretty much everyone is trying to kill everyone else.
</li><li> Again, the French court in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StartTheRevolutionWithoutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StartTheRevolutionWithoutMe">Start the Revolution Without Me</a></em>.
</li><li> The Skeksis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em> are genocidal hedonists who only think about living an eternal life, maintaining their power over Thra, enslaving the Podlings, dressing in riches and feasting, not even bothering with physical exercise. Without an Emperor to keep everyone in check, they would certainly jump at each other's throat. There's justification— since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're the darker halves of the souls of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a></span> it's in their very nature to engage in hedonism and power grabs. It's quickly shown that this is a bad thing for the species because they killed each other until there were only about 10, and that was because the surviving Skeksis are in an eternal power struggle where they can't kill themselves off without the resulting infighting killing them all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The leader of the Mystics knows this so he performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> suicide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">take out their leader</a> and destabilize the court so his stepson Jen can get an opening to complete the prophecy.</span>
<ul><li> Their decadence is expanded upon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance">The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</a></em>, in which it took a dramatic turn when they started getting addicted to Gelfling essence. The Skeksis would sacrifice many Gelflings in the process, and drive them to extinction after a prophecy revealed that a Gelfling would put an end to their reign.
</li></ul></li><li> The cabinet and inner circle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeathOfStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeathOfStalin">The Death of Stalin</a></em> are a republican version of this trope. Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">totalitarian and extremely repressive nature</a> of Stalin's regime (including eliminating people just for stuttering), many of the Politburo betrayed their friends and enforced all of Stalin's order to appease him from purging them too. Out of all the members, Beria was considered as the most depraved and psychotic member as he also performed numerous sexual assaults <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">on children.</a>
</li><li> The Brethren Court in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> series, being the "ruling body" over hordes of uncontrollable rogues and pirates, seems to only have any order at all because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Captain Teague</a> is the one enforcing The Code.

In the westernmost, backwater continent in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> where <em>at least</em> seven major power blocs duke it out to gain control of the realm, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snakes</a>, ambiguous question marks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Heroes</a> trade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">gambits</a> which cost lives like they're in a pillow fight, yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">God Save Us from the Queen!</a></em> No, really. Cersei is many things, but safe to be around is not one of them (especially if you think you have leverage on her).
<ul><li> And they're so busy fighting each other that they don't notice the army of zombies and god knows what else from beyond the Wall.
</li><li> Eddard Stark had the opportunity to become King of Westeros in the backstory, but he let Robert take the Iron Throne. Partly out of a sense of honour, and mostly because he didn't want to deal with the court. Years later, Robert made him Hand of the King and dragged him back to the court, and it all went downhill from there.
</li><li> The Lannisters full stop. They are so rich that they have a long history of decadence and corruption.
</li></ul></li><li> The nobles from the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bitterbynde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bitterbynde">Bitterbynde</a></em> books. The heroine makes a few faux pas and has to run away when her pretence gets discovered — but of course till then she's been the most graceful and beautiful of women at court as well as a thousand times <em>purer</em> than these cruel, superficial twits.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a>,</em> the Agatean Empire has definitely fallen into this, with murder via poisoning or assassination being an acceptable way of promotion (as long as it is discreetly done), powerful noble families, a rather insane Emperor, and rigid class stratification. Of course, Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde make things, well, interesting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, high king Jakoven thinks his court is this. It is not clear whether he is right, or just paranoid ... the only on-screen backstabber at the court is he himself, with his habit of killing the queen's lovers. (No, not out of jealousy, he appoints them to that position himself. He just thinks they're gaining too much influence). Some nobles occasionally spin some intrigues, but mostly against Jakoven, who has only himself to blame for that political climate. Some off-screen backstabbery is implied, but not dwelled on.
</li><li> The royal court from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber">The Chronicles of Amber</a></em>, basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a> and their lackeys. So much backstabbery your brain will give up.
<ul><li> At first the Courts of Chaos, Amber's opposite number, appear a subversion: things there are pretty peaceful for the most part. However, each pentalogy happens to take place in a turbulent time for the relevant court, and it becomes clear Chaos can be just as bad. The difference turns out to be <em>maturity</em>, as Order is a more recent invention and its royal bloodline, while fewer in number and invested with more individual power, simply have less in the way of learning experiences to temper their ambitions.
</li></ul></li><li> Although not a court in the usual way, the nobility from Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurst's <em>The Empire Trilogy</em>, with their oh so deadly Game of the Council, might well qualify.
</li><li> The nobles from the first novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy">The Final Empire</a></em> when their society is still intact. They indulge their extravagances while the rest of the population is nearly starving and there's the extra fun of some of them secretly being <em>Mistborn</em> which means powerful sorcerers and born assassins.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> book:
<ul><li> Rand al'Thor comes into Cairhien, a big city with such a court. At least the intrigue bit is definitely fitting - everyone tries to pull him to their side by sending him invitations. Rand tries to avoid this by burning all the invitations... which they, of course, take as a cunning political move. Ultimately, his actions indirectly lead to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the assassination of the king and the entire country falling into a civil war</span>.
</li><li> The Seanchan also seem to operate under these rules. Tuon, the Empress's daughter and heir, notes that her position was attained partly by eliminating the competition, permanently. She also forgives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Beslan</span>'s acts of treachery during a crisis because he was unaware of the crisis. Her tone suggests that if it were not during a crisis, there would be little to forgive.
</li><li> Seanchan nobles routinely make assassination plans for anyone they deal with, even if they don't really intend to go through with them. Tuon finds it incredible that she and her new husband <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mat</span> won't have to scheme against each other.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> The court of Governor and Sole Autocrat Barholm Clerett in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneralSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneralSeries">The General Series</a></em>, where intrigue is an artform, treachery a given AND on top of everything else the Governor is borderline insane. As the saying goes, 'A simpleton from the Governor's Court could give lessons in intrigue to [any other royal court on the planet, save possibly the Colony's]."
</li><li> The goblin court in John Barnes's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneForTheMorningGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneForTheMorningGlory">One for the Morning Glory</a></em>. Explicitly described as a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt">King Boniface's</a>.
</li><li> The high council of Menzoberranzan, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> books. Usually, the backstabbing comes from a lower-ranking House that <em>wants</em> to be on the high council, but frankly the entire city is afflicted with a pernicious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>. Menzoberranzan is an in-universe study of this trope, as its patron goddess hates stability or any feeling among her followers of security or comfort and only allows them to be unified when she has an immediate use for them. Otherwise she encourages bringing down the strongest of her followers while also keeping her realm from weakening enough to collapse... and should there be the potential of getting a power base better than a city of drow worshippers, she's willing to let it go.
</li><li> David Eddings is very fond of this trope: it shows up in the Imperial Courts of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Malloreon</a></em> and <em>The Tamuli</em>, and the protagonists take great advantage of it: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in <em>The Malloreon</em>, they foment discord to the point that a civil war breaks out inside the walls of the palace; they use it as cover for their escape, while in <em>The Tamuli</em> they help the figurehead emperor overthrow his own government and seize control by throwing a party, getting the assorted aristocrats drunk, and imprisoning the lot of them.</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">furry fantasy novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFangsOfKaath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFangsOfKaath">The Fangs of K'aath</a></em>, the royal court of Osra is a den of decadence and coldblooded political calculation that could consider genocide as well as accommodation as solutions with equal ease. While the heroes, Prince Raschid and his love Sandhri are the first to note it's a fun place for a party with food and sexy serving girls (who are openly eager to hop into bed when asked) galore when it is in a peaceful mood, they are otherwise repelled by its venal side and it suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a> at being nearly totally destroyed in the climactic battle in the end with nearly the entire villainous Royal family dead except for the straight arrow heroes who find themselves unquestionably on top and in charge of things to run their way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptivePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptivePrince">Captive Prince</a> </em> has a <em>helluva</em> one in Vere.

<div class="indent">This was Vere, voluptuous and decadent, country of honeyed poison.

Under the Mountain resembles the Capitol in its elegant brutality, and while the Autumn Court isn't evil per se, it is highly political and quite a swamp to navigate, even for a particularly scrappy human. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Nightmare Court</a> is also this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> duplicitously, so Rhys can keep up the illusion that he's a languid, hedonistic bastard.</span>

He quickly finds that while outright assassination is uncommon, blackmail and deals made in the bedroom are all but standard procedure. And thoroughly enjoys himself.
</li><li> The Imperial Court of Golgotha, homeworld of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathstalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathstalker">Deathstalker</a></em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonRGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonRGreen">Simon R.

His "Forest Kingdom" Series and "Hawk and Fisher" books also feature a wide variety of these. Special mention has to go to the court in <em>Blood and Honour</em>, where they recklessly dally with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">eldritch abominations</a>.
</li><li> In William King's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf">Space Wolf</a> novel <em>Wolfblade</em>, Ragnor is warned in advance that Terra is this.

</li><li> The Japanese Imperial Court in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TaleOfGenji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TaleOfGenji">Tale of Genji</a></em>— and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>— was an epitome of this trope. If its members weren't plotting against each other they were having illicit sex with somebody else's wife or mistress.
<ul><li> The Heian Court started out much more benign—see literature like the <em>Man'youshuu</em> for examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia">what Japan was (supposedly) like</a> about two hundred years prior to <em>Genji</em>. <em>Genji</em> is set in Heian Japan about a century before it fell apart and was replaced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull">Kamakura bakufu</a>, which in turn led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalJapan">Muramachi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">period</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> is practically one long convoluted case of court intrigue. The Emperor, who was secretly in league with the Baron, was trying to off the Duke by giving him a deathtrap "promotion" to take control of a flailing production operation that he surely had no hope of turning around, while the Illuminati-like women's convent neared its ultimate goal and began pulling the political strings in new and dangerous directions, all ending in the collapse of the Corrino Imperium and another Jihad.
</li><li> Special Mention to House Harkonnen, who are revoltingly decadent and incredibly dangerous - the Baron is a fat, disgusting, gluttonous, implied paederast, as well as a sadist; his nephews are 'just' maniacal sadists; torture is something of an after-dinner entertainment (a passage shows Harkonnen workers cleaning up the remains of one of these in one of Brian Herbert's books, a favourite pastime of Caligula) and the whole affair generally resembles Ancient Rome at its worst (gladiatorial arenas, paedophilia and all.) The aesthetic is pretty bizarre, with sweeping robes and gold combined with stinking oil and huge pollution, smoke and filth - the Harkonnen live in finery but are completely filthy both morally and physically.
</li><li> In a chapter header quote from her extensive historical works Princess Irulan casually mentions her suspicion that her father had a hand in some of the attempts to assassinate her mother, sisters and self. She is in fact devoted to her father Shaddam IV, and he to her, but she also knows that her mother's refusal to bear him a male heir has put him in a terrible position making her death and her mother's and siblings politically convenient.

It helps that those involved are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">White Court vampires</a> that make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plans</a> as way of life; at one point Lara says something to the effect that no one will respect her if she attempts to seize power by straightforward means. The Raiths are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">a bit dysfunctional</a>, to say the least.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Winter Court</a> as well. When attending a party in Arctis Tor, Harry tries to keep an eye on anyone suspicious. He soon realizes that's impossible, and instead resolves to keep an eye out for anyone charging at him with a knife and screaming.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyBlack">Holly Black</a>s work, all faerie courts have some aspects of this, but most notable is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFolkOfTheAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFolkOfTheAir">The Folk of the Air</a></em>. Most characters are looking to increase their status, with the exception of Cardan who is not ambitious and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just doesnt want to be beaten for his failures</span>.
<ul><li> Even among the teenagers, you can see aspects of this. Most children sent to lectures are supposed to endear themselves to children of royalty. The bullying in the book is really the teenagers of royalty trying to establish the hierarchy within their lectures.
</li><li> The royal family is a mess of neglect and abuse, and spare no love for each other. Of the members of the royal family who are characterized, the oldest is a psychopath willing to turn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murder his entire family for power</span>, the middle son also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">schemed and murdered his way into power</span>, and the father at least could be charged with child endangerment.

<ul><li> "In my next I will send you a general map of courts; a region yet unexplored by you, but which you are one day to inhabit. The ways are generally crooked and full of turnings, sometimes strewed with flowers, sometimes choked up with briars; rotten ground and deep pits frequently lie concealed under a smooth and pleasing surface; all the paths are slippery, and every slip is dangerous."
</li><li> "Those who now smile upon and embrace, would affront and stab each other, if manners did not interpose; but ambition and avarice, the two prevailing passions at courts, found dissimulation more effectual than violence; and dissimulation introduced that habit of politeness, which distinguishes the courtier from the country gentleman."

However once in awhile a Vor will stoop to thuggery. There are a number of Vor that are useless and vice-obsessed—or pretend to be, like Ivan and By. These seem to be a minority. When Miles was a child, however, the Barrayaran system was much more violent, and assassinations and attempted coups were an expected feature of politics.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgeOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgeOfFire">Age of Fire</a></em> series has the court politics of the Lavadome — hundreds of dragons, all vying for the favor of, or entry into, the Imperial Line. And as for those already in the Line, they're constantly struggling for influence, power, and ultimately the chance to take the Tyr's throne for themselves.

</li><li> The Court of Lothar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Restoree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Restoree">Restoree</a></em> is much too decadent and deadly for a nice American girl like Sara — though in fact she copes quite nicely.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErebusSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErebusSequence">Erebus Sequence</a></em>, Demesne is full of politics and scheming, with few nobles concerning themselves with anything but their own status and advancement. It doesn't help that the king doesn't pay any attention to it and leaves everything in the hands of a manipulative Majordomo. In the second book, attempts by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anea and Russo</span> to reform the court and establish a rudimentary democracy are fiercely and violently resisted.

And everyone is seemingly doing their level best to get as much power as possible, at whatever price.

A standard Klingon state assembly can very easily result in more than a few deaths; at one point during a civil war, the Chancellor was challenged to a duel, and proceeded to kill his opponent before returning to the matters at hand. That all said, more underhanded actions such as poisoning or politicking are considered deeply dishonorable, and if exposed, are not all tolerated; in <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, one Klingon attempted to ruin a rival house by financially assaulting it, and when this came to light he was stripped of his honor and exiled.

At least, until it became a question of "us or the rest of the universe", and they settled on "us" - and as the Doctor explained, when Wilf pointed out how he'd always talked about his people like they were wonderful and amazing, that that was how he <em>chose</em> to remember them, but he has most certainly not forgotten the reality.

This series, based on a series of novels, recounts the life of Claudius, the awkward fool who would be emperor... and the drama, treachery, and intrigue that happened in the royal household.

The Unseelie Court is noted as downright lethal unless you are very, very carefully prepared.
</li><li> The various dukes and duchesses of the Nine Hells of Baator are constantly scheming against each other, fending off ambitious underlings, and aspiring to supplant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype">Asmodeus</a> as the ruler of Hell. For his part, Asmodeus is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> able to play his would-be rivals against each other, most spectacularly in the Reckoning, where Hell split into two warring factions that upended the political order, only for Asmodeus to emerge unscathed. As for the rest of the archdevils:
<ul><li> Archduchess Zariel of Avernus was toppled for a time by her ambitious general Bel, but she's since retaken the position, yet retains Bel's services as an advisor. While she defends the gates of Hell, she also plots revenge against Asmodeus for his part in her corruption.
</li><li> Dispater, the Iron Duke of Dis, has grown increasingly paranoid about retribution from Asmodeus for his part in the Reckoning, and rarely leaves his inner sanctum. His advisor Titivilus does much to encourage these rumors, and now all but rules Dis in his master's name.
</li><li> Viscount Mammon of Minauros was the first to prostrate himself before Asmodeus after the Reckoning failed, to the disgust of his fellow conspirators, and is desperately trying to build up a treasury now that his ex-lover Glasya has become a fellow Archduke, out of fear that she may punish him for not resisting when her father ordered them to break off their relationship.
</li><li> For a long time, Archduchess Fierna of Phlegethos was content to let her father Belial do all the work running the layer while she enjoyed herself (often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest">with him</a>), but after becoming fast friends with Glasya, she's being more active and independent, setting up her own cultist networks "just in case" anything happens to her dear father. Belial has had to put his own schemes against Levistus on hold until he's sure of his daughter's goals and loyalties.
</li><li> Levistus was imprisoned within one of Stygia's glaciers after killing Asmodeus' consort, and for a time the archduke Geryon ruled the frozen layer. Geryon served as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for Asmodeus during the Reckoning, but despite his loyalty he was exiled, and rule of Stygia passed back to Levistus... without the prince being released from his frozen prison. Now Geryon fights an insurgency to retake his position while raging at Asmodeus, and Levistus rules telepathically from an iceberg while raging at Asmodeus. The entire scenario is speculated to be an attempt by Asmodeus to purge the two rivals of their worst tendencies, or create an opening for a more worthy would-be ruler to exploit.
</li><li> Malbolge was once ruled by Moloch, who rebelled against Asmodeus upon the urging of his most trusted advisor, Malagard the Hag Countess. Moloch fled the plane after his defeat and the Hag Countess was installed in his place despite not being a baatezu, but then she was in turn replaced by Glasya, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain">Asmodeus' own daughter</a>, who had ended a rebellious phase and been rewarded by elevation to an Archduchess. She's since poached talented devils from other archdukes' courts and forced them to scramble to readjust their plans without antagonizing her, and by extension, her father. Meanwhile, Moloch is trying to raise a mercenary army to retake his former layer, but is stymied by the fact that every time he returns to Baator, he is demoted from an archdevil to a lowly imp.
</li><li> Baalzebul was once ruler of both Malbolge and his own layer of Maladomini, but as punishment for his betrayal in the Reckoning, Asmodeus transformed Baalzebul into a disgusting sluglike creature, until he had spent a year like that for every lie he told a fellow devil. He's since finished his sentence and regained a humanoid form, but Baalzebul dearly wishes to repay Asmodeus for this humiliation.
</li><li> Mephistopheles of Cania once toppled <em>himself</em> in the guise of "Baron Molikroth," in order to purge his court of conspirators. When he isn't scheming against Baalzebul, Mephistopheles is telling Asmodeus, to his face, how one day he will rule Hell. It's possible that Asmodeus keeps the openly disloyal archduke around because Mephistopheles is so determined that <em>he</em> shall be the one to overthrow Asmodeus that he interferes in the other archdukes' conspiracies to do the same.

<ul><li> The various political scenes in the Empire's provinces tend to feature this sort of thing, with both the nastiness and decadence of political squabbling getting worse the further south you go. People in the northern Empire generally tend to look down on flowery speech and deceit and would much rather settle disputes with simple legal proceedings often concluding in non-fatal trial by combat. This is a necessity, because the northern Empire is regularly harassed by Chaos-worshiping Norse raiders and Dark Elf corsairs, so it usually pays to settle disputes quickly so the Burgomeisters and Elector Count can ready their forces to keep the berserking Vikings and sadistic S&amp;M Elves at bay.
</li><li> Prior to their revamp in 6th edition, the Bretonnians were heavily based on the decadent, narcissism-ruled French aristocracy under Louis XVI, to the point that the cult of Slaanesh, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Mad God</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil">Sex Is Evil</a>, was rampant throughout the nation. They've since become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knights In Shining Armor</a> more likely to settle their offended senses of honor with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat">Trial by Combat</a> than skullduggery.
</li><li> Tilea is run by merchant princes and not nobles, but the region is renowned for the volatility and decadence of its upper crust. Poisoning and assassination are a regular fact of life, and just about anyone worth anything will hire a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CadreOfForeignBodyguards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CadreOfForeignBodyguards">Cadre of Foreign Bodyguards</a> (ogres are particularly favoured) as most Tileans won't trust other Tileans to guard themselves out of fear they've got an agenda (or is on someone else's payroll). The one exception where Tilea is less corrupt than The Empire is that Skaven infiltration is much less common: Tileans hate Skaven and would rather die than cut deals with them, as opposed to some of the Empire's nobility.
</li><li> The Dark Elves' courts are essentially based on control, cruelty and the dominion of the powerful to exercise utter obedience in those underneath them. The <em>Hanil Khar</em> is an annual pledge of allegiance to the ruler of a city that regularly features the <em>cold-blooded torture</em> of any who dare to bring insufficient tribute, with outright execution common to those who <em>really</em> fail to produce. Keep in mind, this is their <em>awards ceremony</em> here. Another indicator of the murderous nature of Druchii court life is the rigid etiquette of social space that evolved because the Dark Elves are <em>so damn paranoid</em> about being straight-up assassinated. Very tellingly, it is measured in sword-lengths. Lowborn Dark Elves may not approach a lord closer than three sword-lengths without being summoned, retainers may remain within two lengths, and lieutenants, trusted retainers and lower-ranking highborn may approach to a single sword-length. Within a sword-length is the most intimate space, and is reserved for lovers, playthings and, very characteristic of the Druchii, <em>mortal enemies</em>. You have to really think about the parties that these guys attended that forced <em>this</em> sort of system to be adopted.
</li><li> The Dark Elves likely inherited this tendency from the High Elves, who practice a downplayed example. The High Elves regularly engage in blackmail, espionage, rumour-mongering and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileups</a> a-plenty in their courts as the various nobles of various ranks and from various regions jockey for position and favour in the Phoenix King's court, to the extent that in certain rulebooks, which character in your High Elf army counted as its General was determined by a dice roll, not who had the highest Leadership value. Even the Phoenix King isn't entirely safe and is expected to play the game in a way good enough that no-one can accuse him of playing it (though an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">elected position</a>, Phoenix Kings rule for life, but said rule can get rather impotent if the princes lack respect for the king, which they will if he lacks political clout). Unlike the Dark Elves, however, violence is limited to honour-duels (and also frowned upon when it happens), and murder is forbidden. The original High Elf/Dark Elf split comes from the one time the 'no murder in politics' rule was broken and the Dark Elves were the ones who agreed with said murder.
</li><li> The Skaven are a species wide example. Any Skaven is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">by nature</a> selfish, backstabbing, and cowardly, who believes that the only thing of importance is the survival and gan of the individual. They will engage in no shortage of assassinations, betrayals, and sabotage, with some warlords getting murdered on the spot by their ostensible allies in front of the others (it's implied that this is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">a perfectly legitimate way</a> of rising in ranks). Even during times of war, different Skaven clans will spend as much time plotting against their "allies" instead of their actual opponents, and even then, the different Skaven in the clans will be plotting against their kin. The lore notes that this is probably the only reason they haven't already taken over the world.

</li><li> The Dark Eldar fit this trope to a T. The Dark City basically started out as a composition of trade hubs and private realms of noble houses that were outside the jurisdiction of the rulers of the old Eldar empire. It was there the spread of decadence that would eventually lead to the Fall of Eldar started, and many of those same noble houses continue to exist 10,000 years later (although many have reinvented themselves as Kabals), still continuing the behaviours that lead to the Fall.

As such, their political intrigue is more cutthroat than is typical elsewhere in Tamriel, with the use of assassinations, spies, and double agents rampant. This has been mitigated somewhat after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">Warp in The West</a>, which converted High Rock's dozens of petty city-states into three "kingdoms," but still prevalent.

According to Garan Marethi afterwards, this is considered standard Volkihar politics. However, when <em>you</em> become the Lord of Volkihar, no one tries anything funny on you, because everyone knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">what you did</a> to the previous Lord who did try.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory">The Last Story</a></em> takes places on an island run by a court which has fallen into this. Nearly anyone who isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">outright evil</a> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most obvious example is Orlais, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">based on</a> medieval France. The unending machinations of the upper class are known as "The Great Game", and participation is considered something of a pastime. Orlesian nobles make extensive use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingMinstrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WanderingMinstrel">bards</a> who are trained in—besides music—espionage, assassination, and sabotage. Even the servants engage in the Game, often working as spies and/or jockeying to improve their own position.
</li><li> Then there's Orzammar, where the Noble Dwarf gets caught up in his younger brother Bhelen's machinations, forcing him to work with Bhelen or his rival Harrowmount. Neither choice is optimal, either. Harrowmount is kind but staunchly conservative, while Bhelan is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a> character but progressive economically and socially.
</li><li> You get to have a go at playing court politics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, when a quest sends you to a grand ball to prevent the Empress's assassination. It starts with you getting judged for your background (unlucky for you if you're anything but a non-mage human) and only gets more murky. If you do well you can get the person of your choice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in charge of the Empire.</span> If not...you get tossed out and the whole kingdom dissolves into chaos as you fail to prevent the killing. The whole sequence features an absurd amount of murder, trickery and nice masks. And shoes, don't forget the shoes.
</li><li> Vivienne, one of your companions in <em>Inquisition</em>, as well as advisers Leliana and Josephine are all accomplished players of the Game - Vivienne because she's the First Enchanter of the local circle and arcane adviser to the Empress, Josephine because she's the ambassador to Orlais from Antiva, and Leliana is a former Bard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Josephine's a former Bard as well, but she quit that job.</span> Shockingly, <em>Solas</em> fits right in himself, even dropping his veneer a bit and becoming a slightly snooty aristocrat, and admitting enjoying court intrigue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Primarily because he was an Evanuris thousands of years ago, the ancient elven equivalent of Orlais.</span>
</li><li> While Orlais is the nation most notorious for their court intrigues, that's only because they're poetic enough to have a name for it. Other nations that engage in this trope are Tevinter (a nation ruled by mages where it's an open secret that any mage of political standing practices blood magic), Antiva (a nation with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a> that's truly controlled by assassins and merchant leaders), and Orzammar (in a notable aversion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">Our Dwarves Are All the Same</a>). The Chantry, the setting's dominant religious sect, engages as well; they're well aware that their decrees shape the culture of the entire continent of Thedas, and clerics (including the Grand Cleric—the setting's Pope) are not above employing spies and assassins to do their dirty work.
</li></ul></li><li> The popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> IV</em> mod <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallFromHeaven">Fall from Heaven</a></em> has the Balseraphs who are all about this trope with the "deadly" part of the trope's former title being key. Those still sane and able to escape have done so long ago. Perpentach, the king of the Balseraphs, likes to dress up as a clown and kill people for amusement (basically, imagine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> being in charge of a country). His daughter Keelyn was born of a brief dalliance with a spy from a nation that seeks to bring out the Apocalypse. Born in a dungeon and kept from human contact, she learned to summon hellish creatures and temporarily rules while her father is away.
</li><li> The Nohrian Court in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>. King Garon's inability to sever ties with a woman once he fell in love with her led him to take many concubines in addition to his wives (Queen Katerina, and once she dies, Queen Arete), so he sired a lot of illegitimate children. While at first he loved all of his children equally and doted on them like a good father would, his concubines fought and chafed with one another for his favor and used their children as a part of this. Bullying, scarring, assassinations and deaths of both concubines and children occured until only four half-siblings were left: Xander (Katerina's son and the legitimate heir), Camilla, Leo, and Elise (all born from concubines), who were all tired of the in-fighting and resolved the inheritance of Nohr's throne among themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">and in the process formed strong ties to one another.</a> Unfortunately, the whole affair not only left deep psychological scars on them (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDutifulSon">Xander</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Camilla</a>) but it horribly hardened the once-kind Garon and he became neglectful, abusive, and ruthless, which became <em>even worse</em> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Queen Arete died in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>. Because Xander, Camilla and Leo remember Garon's doting affection for them, they will not directly oppose him even if they agree that his rule at the present is overly harsh and ruthless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">and they hope that once their father conquers Hoshido, he will go back to the kind ruler and father he was.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">What they don't know is that Garon is dead and his corpse is being used as a familiar by Anankos in his plot to destroy both Hoshido and Nohr.</span>
</li><li> Human society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> is dominated by these, which may have something to do with their decline. Divinity's Reach is controlled by ministers scheming against the Queen. One of them, Minister Caudecus, is a major antagonist in the personal story and Living World Season 3.
<ul><li> The nobles of Vabbi emphasize the decadent aspect of this trope. These people are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperclassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperclassTwit">Upperclass Twits</a> who devote all their time to partying and relaxing, completely oblivious to the abuses of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNecrocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNecrocracy">Mummy ruler</a> or the suffering of the common folk due to the war.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></em>, the Court was once a home to this, a vast collection of nobles and visiting dignitaries from surrounding lands who gradually debased themselves with drink and games until they slid into horrific debauchery involving illicit drugs and cruel, murderous sport. They were so excessively debased that when the Ancestor proposed they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainliningTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainliningTheMonster">drink a wine made of vampire blood</a>, they accepted it eagerly, and barely halted their horrific indulgences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">even while being transformed into monstrous, insects.</a> By the time of the game's events, the Court is now a collection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">crazed, inhuman mosquito-vampires who clothe themselves in the trappings of nobility.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShuyanSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShuyanSaga">Shuyan Saga</a></em>, the prosperous kingdom of Zhong Rong, a long way from any fighting, is not big on taking action. They seem to lean more towards the overly-sensitive, artistically-minded kind of decadence than debauchery (breaking mid-session to look at plum blossoms), but it has the same result — they don't want to send troops.

A bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> trope, since nations with absolute rulers and a wealthy aristocracy have tended to breed Deadly Decadent Courts like flies. Imperial Rome, its medieval continuation the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire, Imperial China, and pre-Revolutionary France are the archetypal examples that most writers seem to crib from. Non-royal "courts" often work too, such as the Soviet Union.
<p></p><ul><li> In the Stalinist Soviet Union, the somewhat "puritanical" version of this trope was in effect. There was officially not supposed to be any decadence, luxuries or other stuff of the sort, but there were plenty of luxuries for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> and his close comrades, though how much they enjoyed them is a different matter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">Stalin gave his mother a palace</a>, for example, but she refused to make use of it, sleeping in the servants' quarters and cooking her own meals. In post-Stalinist times, the decadence finally came to town, though it was still discreet and subtle, never fully shown to outsiders. Though one of the causes of the fall of the USSR was exposure of this corruption and decadence, it survived the fall unscathed and continued in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia">The New Russia</a>, now stripped clean of any and all Communist puritanism and its practitioners reveling in their new status as the officially unequal upper class. Simon Sebag Montefiore called his excellent book on Stalin <em>The Court of the Red Czar</em>.
</li><li> The Byzantine Empire was so infamous for this that another term for this trope is "Byzantine politics." Case in point, Byzantine Empress Irene <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">and her gender swapped version of</a> King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>'s spouse killing spree, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">cutting out the eyes of former Emperors and current Emperors</a> (the Emperor was supposed to be an image of divine perfection, so mutilating somebody made him ineligible). Plus the court was subject to other influences, such as the Church and the Vikings hired for the Varangian Guard (famously resulting in Harald Hadrada, Viking, Varangian Guardsman, soon to be King of Norway, and would-be conquerer of England, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingCastration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingCastration">castrating</a> and ripping out the eyes of Byzantine emperor Michael V Kalaphates in 1042.) Irene specifically had her own son and successor blinded, in a way calculated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">cause his death</a>, in the chamber where she had given birth to him.
</li><li> Even if it sounds strange, the Hittites. The royal court of Hattusa was truly a deadly place—full of relatives ready to betray the king at the first opportunity.
</li><li> The Ottoman Empire was likely the defining post-renaissance example; that it was <em>intentionally</em> set up so that every Sultan's death resulted in a frantic power-grab by every potential heir, with the winner having the legal right to have <strong>ALL</strong> surviving losers strangled to death was just the tip of the iceberg. No matter if your mother was your father's favorite, one of wives, concubines or slaves, all of his sons had equal claim to the throne and represented a threat to you so long as they lived. It didn't help the Janissaries, the Sultan's bodyguards who eventually became corrupt, also chose a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario">new heir</a> to fulfill their political agenda. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem">Ottoman royal harem</a> was no less of an viper's nest, with concubines competing among themselves for the Sultan's affections and to secure their children as the heir so they can become the newest <em>Valide Sultan</em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing">Queen-Mother</a>. To this end, they were not above conspiring with eunuchs to get rid of overly ambitious rivals, like stuffing their bodies into bags and throwing them into sea, or gelding them to prevent them from producing competitors of the throne. Its believed that the average life expectancy of every new concubine was 5 years.
</li><li> The court of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi Arabia</a> approaches this, although exile, shaming, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassignment to Antarctica</a> are preferred to outright killing; after all, almost all members of the court are (half)-brothers or cousins (being descendants of King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud">Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud</a>), and the public image of family unity must be maintained. However, by all accounts, the internal politics of the Al Saud are quite dangerous—particularly now that there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> due in a decade or so that everyone can see coming from a mile away—and the decadence of the Saudi court is so legendary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabOilSheikh">it has a trope</a>.
</li><li> Probably apocryphal, but worth repeating. The astrologer at the court of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCEstMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCEstMoi">Louis XI of France</a> (known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">the Universal Spider</a>" for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">intricate and devious plots</a>) had (quite by accident) accurately foretold the death of someone close to the king. Louis decided to have the unfortunate astrologer executed, but had a last question: "When do you foresee your own death?" The astrologer replied: "That I cannot divine, but it will be three days before Your Majesty's death." After that, the (in real life) superstitious Louis gave the astrologer all possible protection.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">strongly recommended against this</a>; besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">obvious risks to one's personal security</a>, the high taxes required to support a decadent court tend to encourage rebellions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> told Machiavelli "Screw That" and proceeded to create an Absolute French Monarchy revolving around an extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a> political spectacle with him at the centre, building<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ygic');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ygic" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ygic');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">well, converting from a mere royal hunting lodge to a sprawling luxurious palace</span> the chateau de Versailles and controlling the rebelling French barons Fronde by forcing them to develop an expensive lifestyle that defines French fashion to this very day. It worked for a time, and it certainly put an end to the period of French civil wars and the decentralized power of the nobility; but behind the scenes, Louis XIV was working extremely hard to keep the system afloat, and his successors Louis XV and Louis XVI never fully understood that they, too, needed to work hard (failing to master the "accomplishing much" part of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> would call "the art of accomplishing much while appearing to accomplish little"). Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, and a posthumous I-told-you-so for Machiavelli.
<ul><li> The system of Louis XIV's royal court itself also caused problems for his successors, for instance by increasingly isolating the king and his court as well as a large part of the aristocracy from the reality of life in Paris and the provinces, which contributed to the slowly building crisis that culminated in the Revolution. Also the decadence of the court, which to a large extent was exactly what Louis planned, gradually became a reason for intellectuals of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a> to criticise the court and the aristocracy and caused notable scandals. During Louis' own reign the "Affair of the Poisons" (1677-1682), during which many members of the court and even some of the king's inner circle were implicated and accused of poisoning and witchcraft put the "Deadly" in <em>Deadly Decadent Court</em> as, despite being partially hushed up, it resulted in 36 executions, two persons dying under torture, and several prominent courtiers falling from grace or being exiled.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rei9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rei9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rei9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Among the exiled was the Countess of Soissons; her son, Prince Eugene of Savoy stayed in France, but because his mother was disgraced Louis did not allow him to gain a military command. This led to him to leave the country and enter the service of Louis' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic">Austrian Habsburg</a> enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Where Eugene's leadership was instrumental in defeating France in the War of Spanish Succession</a>.</span> Also the system where courtiers had to vie for the king's favour and conduct intrigues against each other did not always lead to the most competent men being assigned the important state positions. That finance minister Nicolas Fouquet abruptly was stripped of his office and possessions and imprisoned for life is said to have been due to the machinations of his rival Colbert, while it is said of many a French commanding general in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> that they were good at currying Louis XIV's favour but bad at leading an army. And the problems caused by royal favour and support by court cabals deciding who was put into command of France's armies would grow even worse during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a>...
</li><li> His rule also laid the seeds of the French Monarchy's total financial ruin and the revolution. A large part of his efforts to win over the nobility was built on essentially making the nobility and the church tax exempt. A loss in revenue that was ultimately never made up for, but which was compensated for by drastically increasing the number and rates which the peasantry had to pay to the crown. Which was simply added on top of the taxes the peasants already paid to their local church and nobility to begin with. His successors' incompetence is often blamed because things started falling apart under them, but the financial system of the French Monarchy was a ticking time bomb because of him which ultimately resulted in both the Revolution and in the bankruptcy of the state.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s inner circle was full of people vying to outdo the other; they called it the <em>Obersalzberg Kamarilla</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer">Albert Speer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Hitler's chief architect, and later on super-minister of the Third Reich, describes this in great detail in his memoirs, showing that this deadly decadence was a crucial factor in the defeat of Germany. Even as the war grew larger and riskier, and as Germany's armies faced stronger resistance and suffered great defeats, Hitler's inner circle focused mostly on political rivalry and on backstabbing each other, not caring all that much about the war. And going further down the pyramid, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauleiter">gauleiters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (sort of a regional governor with almost-absolute authority) only cared about their wealth and luxury, protecting their share of Germany's income with absolute zeal, even on the brink ot total defeat. Even though his main priority was overseeing the country's military economy, Speer had to distract himself with these political rivalries to keep himself in power. In other words, just like Louis XIV and (probably) Stalin, Hitler planted the seeds of his empire's downfall even before it began to rise.
</li><li> Part of this was because Hitler himself deliberately encouraged infighting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> in the NSDAP and the government, as he thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">it would lead to the most capable people rising to power</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on who you ask, the US President's staff, Joint Chiefs, and various executive underlings qualify. Although the person you ask may say it was worse under one president and not so bad under another.
</li><li> Office politics can be this sometimes, if you replace killing with firing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> had a lot of this, as numerous Legion generals attempted to usurp the throne, Senators attempted to humiliate or murder their rivals, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal">murdering Emperors who didn't pay them enough or upset them in some way</a>, and more. This is a major reason as to why the Western Roman Empire failed: due to Senators and merchants not wanting to pay to support the army, plus would-be usurpers and civil wars impacting the quality of the Legions, the Empire eventually collapsed under its own weight, with only the Byzantine Empire managing to endure despite this.
</li></ul><ul><li> In her letters, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Charlotte,_Madame_Palatine">Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> wrote to her relatives and friends complaining about the increasingly decadent French court at Versailles during the 18th century:
<div class="indent"> I believe that the histories that will be written about this court after we are gone will be better and more entertaining than any novel, and I am afraid that those who come after us will not be able to believe them and think they are just fairy tales.
