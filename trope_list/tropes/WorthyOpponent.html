<p>When the hero and the villain clash repeatedly, over time they may develop respect for their opponent's abilities. After all, their adversary is able to keep rising to oppose them battle after battle. In the heat of battle the hero or villain's true capabilities and determination could be revealed. Or perhaps one of them was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker">looking for a challenge</a>. For whatever reason, the battles have created a sense of respect (which may or may not be mutual).

<ul><li> The DC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds">Elseworlds</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanRedSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanRedSon">Superman: Red Son</a></em>, in which the infant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a>'s rocket ship crash lands in the Soviet Union and Kal-El is brought up to become a Communist leader, the American scientist (and, later, President) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> is Superman's Worthy Opponent, impressive for a man with no superpowers. Their rivalry is much more personal than the international politics they are embroiled in, and though they are constantly seeking to destroy one another, Superman, at one pivotal moment, refers to Lex as "old friend". Lex, the irony lost on him, at one point muses that he and Superman could have been close allies had Superman been raised in America.
<ul><li> Every incarnation portrays their relationship this way. Luthor is the one person Superman can't defeat with strength and Superman is the one person Luthor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">can't control</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">his wealth.</a>
</li><li> This is only true of the post crisis continuity, since the golden and silver age Luthor was a known criminal rather than the perceived philanthropist he is now.
</li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">"Imaginary Story"</a> involved a minor villain named Dimension Master killing Lois Lane, and Superman having to deal with it. Dimension Master then has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> wife briefly disguise herself as Lois just to further torment him. At this, Dimension Master is suddenly defeated by <em>Luthor and Brainiac.</em> Supes asks in astonishment why they are helping him, and they tell him that even though they are his enemies, they <em>respect</em> him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">they couldn't stand watching D.M.'s pointless cruelty.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Cold, the Rogues, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> have this going on, if Cold's lines in Forever Evil and the Rogues Revolution / Rogues Rebellion storylines are any indication. After all, the Rogues are a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillains">blue - collar criminals</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">refuse to kill</a> unless the person was someone who really had it coming or broke their rules, like Owen Mercer, who broke the no killing rule, and Inertia, who made them break it themselves. A lot of their dialogue with The Flash and the fact that they allied with him in Revolution only adds to this.

</div></li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">Charles Xavier and Magneto</a>, despite <em>wildly</em> differing views on mutants and their role in normal (well, for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>) society, get on fairly well. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> blew up Genosha, Xavier even went to help Mags clean up. Since about 2005, and Xavier's slow and self-imposed eradication of his ethics, he's getting some rightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> accusations from his X-Men.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a> is the quintessential example of this in the <em>Batman</em> mythos. Ra's sees Batman as a worthy and honorable foe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotsoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotsoDifferent">someone who ultimately shares the same goal</a> but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiestheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiestheMeans">not willing to do what is ultimately necessary to achieve it</a>. Such is his admiration of the Dark Knight that Ra's, when he is not fighting Batman in a sabre-duel to the death or setting a deadly trap for him, frequently and repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">offers Batman the chance to both succeed him as head of the League of Assassins</a> and to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter">marry his daugher, Talia</a>. He holds the ultimate trump card against Batman - knowledge of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> - but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">above revealing it to his other enemies for the sake of leverage</a>. Batman, however, does not seem to reciprocate these feelings, at least to the same extent, as his stoic and inflexible moral code prevents him from seeing Ra's as anything but a madman and a monster. He does, however, acknowledge and take advantage of Ra's' code of honor, and despite the inherent friction of the situation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">entertains an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Talia</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, to an even greater degree. He sees Batman, not only as a worthy opponent, but as "the only human being that can keep up with him." The feeling is (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">usually</a>) not mutual, by the way. While Batman refuses to kill the Joker because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">his one rule</a>, he just sees the Joker for the murderous psychopath he is and accords him no praise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler">The Riddler</a> <em>lives</em> to go head-to-head with Batman, the only person he believes to be a worthy challenge for his intellect. Some fans believe this makes him stupid for constantly giving away clues to what he's going to do, but the Riddler doesn't care about money or material objects. All he cares about is having his Worthy Opponent's full attention and the thrill of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also an incredibly minor subtext of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>, between Reed Richards and his <strong>ARCHNEMESIS!!!</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>. The two of them regularly top canon and fanon lists of the smartest men in the Marvel Universe, and Reed steps in and out of feeling guilty for what happened to Doom in college<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bz8f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bz8f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bz8f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even though Reed is a complete innocent and tried to warn Doom about a serious flaw in the experiment that scarred him and got him expelled.</span>. Part of it comes from the fact that they don't have to talk down to each other — smartest men in the world and all that.
<ul><li> Doom still does anyway, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">''none possess the luxurious prose and unmatched scientific acumen of DOOM!''</a>. Indeed, a large part of Doom's characterization boils down to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> and his belief that he must prove himself Reed's better. It finally comes full circle during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of the old 616-universe, where Doom finally admits that Reed is smarter than him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan">Iron Man</a> also counts in this. Although Doom's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">never quite forgiven him</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">declining Doom's exceedingly generous offer</a> to become one of Doom's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">minions</a>, he seems to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesUsEven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesUsEven">gotten over</a> that whole "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">destroyed your plans of domination for Camelot</a>" thing, which is pretty impressive, considering that Doom isn't usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">forgiving sort</a>.

He even goes so far as to praise how he fights against Todoroki.

</li><li> While not precisely canon, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhh9BNbyCuM">"The Destiny of the Doctors"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has the Master express this sentiment toward his longtime adversary. Interestingly, he does not feel this way about ALL of The Doctor's incarnations. He talks smack on Four, Five, Six and Seven, but seems to genuinely have great respect for Three. One and Two also seem to fall under Worthy Opponent.
</li><li> The Doctor actually viewed Sec, <em>a Dalek</em>, as this.

<div class="indent"><em>"She's <strong>good.</strong> She's like my nemesis. I've never had a nemesis before. I kinda like it."</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Littlefinger and Varys seem to enjoy verbally sparring with each other and clearly see each other as the only other person on their mental level.
</li><li> Jaime sees Eddard as one in regards to sword-fighting. He admits that he's heard of Eddard's reputation and wants to test his mettle. When he finally gets the chance to square off with Eddard, a guard screws it up by interfering.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jaime:</strong> Brave man that Ned Stark, but terrible judgment.
</div><ul><li> However, he also clearly has a lot of resentment for the "Honorable Ned Stark" for how he thinks he wouldn't even give him a chance to explain why he killed Aerys, and judging him as being a dishonorable wretch for this genuinely well-intentioned and heroic action, despite Ned not being as squeaky clean as others believed.
</li></ul></li><li> Few people manage to hold their own against Lord Tywin Lannister, and he shows a certain respect for each of them in return:
<ul><li> He considers Lady Olenna to be his intellectual equal and recognizes that she's the true head of House Tyrell, as he deals with her directly when arranging a marriage between their two families, and not with her son Mace, who is technically the Lord of Highgarden. Olenna then praises Tywin for living up to his reputation and considers him a quality rival. It's most notable at the wedding of Joffrey and Margaery, and he blows off the rest of the people there to take a stroll in the gardens with Olenna. In spite of being leading figures in separate sides of a civil war, the two are chatting away like old friends. It is one of the few times Tywin looks anything remotely resembling happy.
</li><li> Robb Stark to Tywin, enough that he acknowledges that he badly underestimated Robb and how talented the Young Wolf is as a battlefield technician and that Robb is not going to lose through conventional means. Not bad for a boy of eighteen.
</li><li> While his hatred and contempt for Tyrion son is very evident, he still (ever so grudgingly) is aware of his son's intelligence, perception, and cunning, which is why he was willing to name him Hand in his stead and give him power during crucial times. Later, he names Tyrion the new Master of Coin, which seems like a snipe at the time (and Cersei and Pycelle certainly interpret it as such), but when Tywin's financial problems are later revealed, it's clear that the appointment was really based on his trust in Tyrion's managerial competence.
</li><li> He views his cup bearer at Harrenhal as more competent than all his advisers and she's one of the few people to get away with snarking at him, because Tywin enjoys that she's sharp and gutsy enough to match him. Of course ironies of ironies, what he doesn't know is that she's actually Arya Stark, the daughter of his archenemy. Whether he would have been more impressed with her if he'd known she was the runaway Stark daughter and managed to survive right under his nose, or just angered at her brazenness was never explored.
</li></ul></li><li> Tyrion doesn't hate his adversaries and isn't above recognizing and praising their virtues, which allows him to analytically assess them, unlike the more dismissive Lord Tywin. Despite his tense interactions with the Starks, Tyrion acknowledges Robb's good qualities. Despite suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> tendencies, Tyrion has great admiration for Catelyn, acknowledging that she was a fierce woman who loved her children and he regards her and Robb's fates as a terrible crime. This is used against him during his trial. Several witnesses imply or outright state that he was a traitor because he did not express visible (or any) pleasure at the deaths of Robb and Catelyn. Quite the opposite, in fact. Because, a <em>loyal</em> Lannister would take joy in the deaths of their enemies, no matter how despicably they were killed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tyrion:</strong> I admired her... she wanted to have me executed but I admired her. She was a strong woman and she was fierce when it came to protecting her children.
</div></li><li> Sandor lets Brienne know that he sees her as this when they meet again at the end of Season 7, noting that she came closer to killing him than anyone else.
</li><li> Out of everyone she's had turned to ashes and carbon; Daenerys seems disquieted at losing Lord Randyll Tarly's allegiance and acumen as a commander, even proclaiming that she respects how he will not trade his honour for his life.
</li><li> When he served the Mad King, Ned Stark apparently considered Ser Barristan Selmy this, holding him no ill will. In the present day, they are on the same side, Ned remarks he is glad they never met in combat, as he didn't feel that "a widow's life would suit [Catelyn]." Ser Barristan reciprocates the feeling, telling him that he's too modest and that he thinks that he's also a great warrior. He also says that he's seen Ned cut down 'a dozen great knights', probably at the Trident.
</li><li> The Unsullied are the only foot soldiers the Dothraki have any real respect for, considering their history with them.
</li><li> Stannis Baratheon, ever so slightly with Mance Rayder. He accepts Mance's slightly ominous offer of good luck with a wry smile and a small nod, before burning him at the stake for being both a wildling and a Night's Watch deserter. Stannis genuinely wants the <em>man</em> (not just the King beyond the Wall) to accept his offer to kneel and live.
</li><li> Yara Greyjoy:
<ul><li> She shows shades of this when calling Theon out on apparently murdering Bran and Rickon, noting that the boys' continued resistance of Theon and his Ironborn was a mark of bravery.
</li><li> Ramsay also considers her as one during their encounter at the Dreadfort.

<ul><li> There's a variation. Carl Elias laments that it's hard to find a worthy opponent in prison, then finds one when Harold Finch agrees to visit him from time to time.

</li><li> Again in reference to Finch, Root uses the trope name when she contacts him at the end of 'Root Cause'.

Mahone frequently expresses his professional admiration of Michael, and is the only person that Michael really fears will catch him (out of, you know, the entire United States law enforcement community). However, while he fulfills every other requirement to a T, Mahone subverts one aspect of the trope by being genuinely committed to killing Michael, and offs a fair few other characters along the way.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheProfessionals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheProfessionals">The Professionals</a></em>. Cowley says of a KGB opposite number whom they've just killed; "Terkoff. He was a good man." As his partner has just been shot by Terkoff, Doyle angrily points at where Doyle is lying and snaps, "Yeah? Well, there's a better man back there!"
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em>, master thief Despereaux is impressed when Shawn is the first to figure out that his "robberies" are really just taking stuff so the owners can cash in on the insurance. Seeing Shawn a bit let down by this, Pierre decides to become a thief for real. He and Shawn clash a few more times but also work together as clearly Despereaux appreciates Shawn's smarts and the challenge of beating him.
<ul><li> Wonderfully played with in how Detective Lassiter was convinced <em>he</em> was Despereaux's main rival, having been chasing the man for years. When they finally meet, Lassiter is stunned to realize the thief has absolutely no idea who Lassiter even is.
</li></ul></li><li> Hauptmann Hans Dietrich of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRatPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRatPatrol">The Rat Patrol</a></em>. Though he was rarely able to stop the Allied commando unit, he was smart and always honorable.

Sherlock doesn't seem to mind- in fact, he rather enjoys their game- until his friends' lives are threatened. Also a deconstruction. Moriarty is so smart that only one man can really challenge him: Sherlock Holmes. As a result, he's so fanatically devoted to taking him down that he will go to any lengths to win: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely, ruining Sherlock's entire public reputation, hurting his loved ones, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteHisGun">shooting himself in the mouth</a>.</span>
</li><li> The typical dynamic between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty reflecting this trope is curiously subverted in the 1980s-1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> series starring Jeremy Brett; while Moriarty appears to regard Holmes as this, Holmes appears to view Moriarty with nothing more than fear and contempt.

At the end he's defeated Spartacus' forces <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and lost to Spartacus in personal combat</span>, and is clearly in awe of him. Spartacus for his part, clearly recognizes Crassus as his most dangerous foe and seems to have a grudging respect for that. However, he also hates everything that Crassus stands for, namely Rome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em>:

</li><li> In the episode "The Squire of Gothos", it is clear that Trelane regards Kirk in this manner. Indeed, Trelane treats the entire encounter with Kirk and the Enterprise crew as an elaborate game.
</li><li> It is extremely common throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original series</a> (and its movies) for the opponent to be a Worthy Opponent of Kirk or, at the very least, have a very healthy respect for him (albeit one full of hatred). Most notable of these was Khan Noonien Singh, originally a Worthy Opponent of Kirk— as well as the only one who was also an actual Earth-man (vs. simply a metaphor); in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E22SpaceSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E22SpaceSeed">Space Seed</a>", the two Worthy Opponents parted in mutual respect and honor, with Kirk dropping all charges against Khan and granting him his original wish of a new world to command.

</li></ul></li><li> In "Bread and Circuses", a local ruler captures Kirk and orders him to surrender his crew (as Merik, a previous Federation captain, had done), or else face death in the arena. Kirk chooses death, and the ruler makes it plain that he respects Kirk far more for making that choice—he dismisses Merik from the room with the sneer, "The thoughts of one man to another could not possibly interest <em>you!"</em>

<div class="indent"><strong>Ikat'ika:</strong> I yield. I cannot defeat this Klingon. All I can do is kill him. And that no longer holds my interest.
</div></li><li> The Jem'Hadar seem to hold the Klingons as a whole as a worthy adversary. The first Jem'Hadar encountered by the Deep Space 9 crew was disappointed seeing that a Klingon was not amongst them. What makes this even more impressive is that the Jem'Hadar hadn't even encountered the Klingons yet. They'd simply heard of them through word of mouth from prisoners captured from other Alpha Quadrant colonies.
</li><li> Starfleet Engineers are respected by the Dominion as the undisputed masters of technology, fabled to be able turn "rocks into replicators."
</li><li> Quark views Odo this way, and is eager for the respect to be returned. In the series finale, Quark wants to hear the words "you certainly were a worthy adversary," but Odo theatrically harrumphs and leaves. Kira tries to console him, but Quark is well satisfied.

When Ragnar surrendered himself to Ecbert, they had a drunken feast where they debated about each others gods in Ecbert's hall despite the fact that Ragnar was still his prisoner and was being sent to his death, much to Ecbert's deep regret.

The Khan asks Igor if all is well (<em>Konchak's Aria</em>) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (<em>Polovtsian Dances</em>). In a later part of the opera Igor manages to escape, which makes the Khan respect him all the more.

Hector was an honorable man and considered a worthy foe by many of the Achaean heroes fighting at Troy. Achilles had no such feelings for the man; he spent the early parts of the war pissed at his own leaders and the later parts in nothing less than a homicidal rage toward everyone after Hector killed Patroclus, and spent a lot of time and effort trying to desecrate Hector's corpse. Although he did relent after he'd taken his revenge and cooled down a bit. Achilles actually seemed to think more of Hector's father, Priam, as a worthy opponent (in the overall war) when the latter came to beg for his son's body for proper burial. Achilles agreed to allow Hector the honor he deserved, but Priam's love for his son and his bravery in coming alone to the Greek ships also got to him.

</li><li> Thor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> once visited a Jotun who offered him three challenges to test his legendary strength: to pick up the Jotun's pet cat, empty a largish drinking horn, and wrestle with the Jotun's old nurse. Thor could barely raise one of the cat's paws off the ground, took three superhumanly huge draughts from the drinking horn but couldn't come near to emptying it, and was thrashed by the old nurse. The severely frightened Jotun informed Thor that he had, in fact, just succeeded in lifting the head of the Midgard Serpent, lowered the worldwide sea level, and put up a very good fight against the personification of Old Age. The Jotun told him this while escorting him from his kingdom, upon which he congratulated and complimented Thor and hightailed it home.
<ul><li> This story varies depending on the retelling. Another challenge that is often including (always three challenges, including the drinking horn) is an eating contest, where Thor strips his meat down to the bone, but in the same time, his opponent completely consumes the meat, the bones, and the plate itself. This was the personification of Fire itself.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">college football</a>, few rivalries are as heated as the one between the Texas Longhorns and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, whose fans often sport shirts with the Longhorns' logo's horns sawn off. However, when they aren't actually <em>facing</em> each other, both teams will occasionally show a little in-state solidarity. During the 2006 Rose Bowl championship, when the underdog Longhorns defeated the favored USC, some Aggies fans donned t-shirts with an image of their rival's logo with bandaged horns and the caption "Today Only: Gig 'Em, Horns!"
</li><li> However, the college football rivalry (and to a lesser extent, the rivalry in other sports) between Army and Navy has to be the best example of this. Although the two teams are fierce rivals on the field, and cries of "Beat Army!" and "Beat Navy!" are heard year-round, they have high respect for each other, knowing that in a few years, they could be fighting alongside each other on a real battlefield. At the end of each game, the winning team joins the student body of the losing team in singing that school's alma mater, and then the losers join in with the winners to sing theirs.
<ul><li> The rivalry between these two schools and the Air Force Academy is a lesser, but still strong, example, as is the Division III Secretaries Cup between the Coast Guard and Merchant Marine Academies.
</li></ul></li><li> Some British football rivalries can take this form at times, particularly if the teams in question share a town, such as Liverpool and Everton, or a particular region, such as Newcastle and Sunderland, particularly if fans of each team are playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> in another part of the country.
<ul><li> Rangers and Celtic, both of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Glasgow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, are attempting to recast the Old Firm rivalry as this in an effort to eliminate its historic sectarian overtones, with mixed success. The rivalry in question is rooted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishQuestion">ethno-religious conflicts</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">far older</a> than mere football.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost every hockey fight between two enforcers, whose main job is to fight and add toughness, is this. All of them follow an unwritten code and respect the other player for their efforts.
</li><li> The rivalry between legendary basketball players Larry Bird and Earvin "Magic" Johnson is the ultimate example between athletes. After first meeting in college in the 1979 national championship game, Bird and Johnson revitalized the struggling NBA during the 1980s, meeting in the NBA Finals three times and winning a combined 8 NBA championships and 6 MVP awards between them. Their rivalry was a proxy for multiple cultural issues in the United States at the time: West Coast vs. East Coast, Hollywood glitz and glam vs. blue collar work ethic,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lvxr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lvxr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lvxr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bird and Johnson, both emphatically working-class Midwesterners despite their different backgrounds (Bird being a white hick from rural Indiana, Johnson being the son of a black GM autoworker from Michigan's moderately-large capital), found this somewhat confusing, although they did embrace it to some degree (Johnson in particular loved the LA lifestyle).</span> even the racial politics of black (Johnson) vs. white (Bird). Johnson claimed that the 82-game season was divided into two levels of importance, with 80 regular games, and two games against Bird. Similarly, Bird said that the first thing he did every morning was check the newspapers to see how Johnson had done. However, despite the rivalry, the two had great respect and admiration for each other, and eventually developed into friends (starting around 1986, when they filmed a Converse commercial together). Bird was the man who formally inducted Johnson into the Basketball Hall of Fame during the induction ceremony; on the occasion of Bird's retirement, Johnson attended and described Bird as a "friend forever".
</li><li> Similar to the Bird/Johnson example, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiltChamberlain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiltChamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a> and Bill Russell. They epitomized Statistical dominance vs Championships , <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthusiasmVsStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnthusiasmVsStoicism">the charismatic larger-than-life attitude vs politically militant disciplined stoicism</a>, playing for many teams vs staying with one, and individual brilliance vs the consummate team player. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird faced each other 37 times, Chamberlain and Russell faced each other 142 times. Outside of basketball, they were great friends, though the friendship soured after 1969 and was only revived in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> Many former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a> players express approval at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a> breaking their records, but particular mention must be given to Björn Borg. Borg holds the record for the most number of consecutive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> titles and in 2001 he personally thanked Federer for beating Pete Sampras who had been about to equal that record. Six years later Borg turned up to watch Federer equal the record and publicly congratulated him.
<ul><li> Speaking of tennis, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras played against each other 34 times before they retired, with Sampras winning 20. Especially during Agassi's late career revival, journalists freely admitted Agassi gave it his all every time they faced off. If he lost, it was nothing he did wrong, it was a matter of the better player winning. Even after retiring, Agassi and Sampras remain close friends.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings</a> have one of the most storied rivalries in professional sports, meeting in over 800 games since they joined the league, however their relationship has gradually moved much more towards that of Worthy Opponents in recent years. Despite their history there is a great deal of mutual respect for each other, particularly in contrast with more recent rivalries such as the one the Hawks currently have with the Vancouver Canucks and the Wings had with the Colorado Avalanche in the 90s, each of which are/were much more overtly hostile. The outrage over Detroit moving to the Eastern Conference following the 2013 season was rooted greatly in a belief by fans of both teams and even the sport as a whole who believe that meetings between them almost always result in the best hockey anyone will ever watch. The one thing that people are almost universally happy about with the realignment is the potential for the two to meet in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup">The Stanley Cup</a> Finals which has not happened since 1934, in the Original Six era.
</li><li> In the NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens. The two teams are rivals in the AFC North, and they really cannot stand each other - their rivalry is said to be one of the most bitter in the NFL. However, both teams are also willing to admit that the other is generally a very tough team to beat and that Ravens/Steelers games are always hard fought. Some even say that the rivalry helps to keep both teams at the top of their game, and that's why both teams have been among the NFL's most consistently successful franchises since the mid 2000s. And oddly, the longer the rivalry endures, the less bitter it gets - although the teams still can't stand each other, they both take great pride in how the Ravens/Steelers rivalry is considered hands down the best rivalry in the NFL, and the Cincinnati Bengals have, for various reasons, become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">more hated enemy</a> of both teams.
<ul><li> Also helping matters is the fact that Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward and Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, each a player that the other team could not stand, have both since retired. Following their departures, the rivalry has become a bit more respectful in recent years.
</li><li> Prior to the Ravens' formation, the Steelers had their intense rivalry with the Cleveland Browns, who the Ravens were born out of a plan to move the Browns there<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jreq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2jreq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jreq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Long story short: In 1995, Browns owner Art Modell planned to move the Browns to Baltimore, but after the city of Cleveland objected, a compromise was settled where the Browns' players would move to Baltimore, but the Browns' records and history would stay in Cleveland, before reviving the Browns as an expansion team in 1999.</span>. Steelers owner Dan Rooney was one of only two NFL team owners to oppose the move, and in their last matchup in the 1995 season, Steelers fans wore orange armbands to honor their rivals.
</li></ul></li><li> Springing up after the 2016 World Series. The Cubs and Indians were both overcoming major long-time losing streaks and finally had a shot at victory. Things were tied in Game 7 going into extra innings when the Cubs finally saw an opening and won. Many Cubs fans expressed admiration for the Indians and their fans. Even thought the Cubs hadn't won in over a century, they said the victory wouldn't have been as sweet if they hadn't gone down to the wire against an equally talented team.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> and Joe Frazier, despite an extremely bitter rivalry, were very complimentary of the other's skill. After their legendary trilogy of matches, Ali stated that Frazier brought out the best in him as a boxer, and that if he ever got called to a holy war, wanted Frazier fighting right by his side.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">fourth game</a>, Apollo Justice gets his own Worthy Opponent, Klavier Gavin. While Klavier insults Apollo and refers to him as "Herr Forehead" quite a bit, Klavier never intentionally hides anything from Apollo, never tries to screw him over, and willingly helps Apollo as much as his duties as a prosecutor allow him to.

The reason being that the murder victim (a bodyguard) was one of the very few people badass enough to <em>stop</em> a de Killer assassination, not to mention actually broke his arm in the process. This really struck a chord with de Killer, who is usually able to kill his targets without getting a scratch on him, and he wanted to help get justice for such a skilled opponent.
</li><li> In the third case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dane Gustavia</span> is deeply disappointed that Jeff Master was the one suspected of the murder, since they deeply respected Master <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a fellow pastry chef</span> and considered him a worthy opponent.

Since dying in battle and going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Valhalla</a> is something very desirable for Vikings, Aku, being the asshole that he is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">did not kill the Viking</a> but instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">sealed him in an unbreakable crystal prison where he would live forever</a>, then stuck the crystal in the middle of a mountain for good measure.

He then turned the inside of the mountain into a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a> to ensure that only a warrior strong enough to beat him would ever be able to reach him, so he can go to Valhalla at last. That warrior turns out to be Jack, of course.
</li><li> Another episode had Aku travelling to an alien planet and enlisting some of its inhabitants, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Hunter Race</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">cat-men</a>, to capture the elusive samurai.

This respect does <em>not</em> extend to the other Crystal Gems, as she initially refuses to fight "a defective Pearl, an overcooked runt, and a Fusion" personally, and later talks Garnet down before their duel on her ship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">for being a Fusion of two "weak" Gems trying to be strong</a>.

Tellingly, many of Xanatos' schemes in the series consist of creating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a> of Goliath that will serve him, ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> that look like Goliath, a personal suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> that looks like Goliath, pseudo-Gargoyles, and finally an outright clone.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Macbeth</a> is also one of these; he is one of the only humans who can match Goliath in hand-to-hand combat, but he also shares a similar code of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">warrior's honor</a> and though he has clashed with the gargoyles on several occasions- and would likely do so again if his goals called for it- there is little real malice, and a good deal of respect, on both sides.

And after Arthur shows himself still worthy of wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Excalibur</a>, Macbeth accepts the defeat without a fight.

They butted heads multiple times in political debates, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/james-carville-mary-matalin-recall-finding-love-101333">but wound up getting married in 1993,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> since, though they admit they do <em>not</em> talk politics at home.
</li><li> Politicians almost always invoke this trope when acknowledging an opponent they've just defeated, and occasionally under other circumstances such as their opponent's retirement or death. In 2010, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was ousted after a successful leadership challenge by his deputy Julia Gillard. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott described Rudd as "a worthy opponent" and said "he deserved better".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> genuinely despised one other, even referring to each other as their nemesis, but they still respected each other's respective talents and were willing to work together when they had a common goal. The most well known example of this was in 1790, when the two men negotiated for both the foundation of the National Bank and moving the capital to its current location in Virginia. In fact, Hamilton endorsed Jefferson in the presidential election in 1800, actively convincing his Federalist allies to elect him instead of Aaron Burr, and after Hamilton's death Jefferson referred to him as "honest and honorable".
</li><li> George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev called up Bush to tell him it was his last day in office; his resignation meant the end of the Soviet Union. Still, Bush related, "There was a kind of sadness. Of course it was Christmas time, and I felt that a friend was hurt, and I wasn't happy about that."
</li><li> Barry Goldwater and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>: Goldwater was looking forward to running against Kennedy in the 1964 election, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnecmOWI-s">was crushed by the assassination<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The two were such good friends outside of their jobs that there was even some anecdotal evidence that the two planned to campaign <em>together</em>, having a long series of debate-style campaign stops.
</li><li> Goldwater, an amateur photographer, always cherished a candid photograph he took of Kennedy during a White House reception. Goldwater sent Kennedy the photo, only to have the President return it to him with a friendly inscription urging Goldwater to become a professional photographer!
</li></ul></li><li> In the convention of U.S. Presidential and other races, once the final results are published and the loser phones the winner to concede defeat, in this conversation they are expected to treat each other as worthy opponents - whether or not they actually feel this way. The losing candidate's voters also tends to respect the winner of a presidential election and gives him a "honeymoon" period. A few elections subverted this trope, either because of incumbency, intense personal animus towards the victor (1860), legitimacy questions (1824, 1876, 2000), or both of the latter two (2016).
</li><li> Shawnee chief Tecumseh resisted the westward expansion of the United States and died in 1813 fighting as an ally to the British in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a> at the Battle of the Thames. Yet his name was soon given to several people — notably Civil War generals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Napoleon Jackson Tecumseh Dana</a> — and also to at least two U.S. Navy warships, eight towns and townships in America, and a mountain in Vermont.
<ul><li> Simon Kenton, a renowned American frontiersman, was called upon to identify Tecumseh's body after the Battle of the Thames. He knowingly identified the wrong body in order to prevent Tecumseh's from being desecrated by souvenir-seekers, attracted to the legend which had grown around the chief.
</li></ul></li><li> The French Marshal <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilippePetain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilippePetain">Philippe Petain</a> collaborated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and headed the Vichy regime. After the liberation of France in 1944, Pétain was taken by the retreating German Army and brought to Germany. However, he refused to further collaborate with the Nazis and insisted upon being allowed to leave. Finally, he was escorted to the Swiss border. Rather than try to seek asylum in neutral Switzerland, Pétain proceeded directly to the French border and gave himself up to the new government in his homeland - knowing that he would face treason charges. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, Petain's staunch foe, conceded that Pétain's decision to return to France to face his accusers in person was "certainly courageous". That might have contributed to De Gaulle's later decision to have Petain's death punishment commuted. He eventually died in prison, six years later.
</li><li> Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa was seen as this by the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_commune">Free Communes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Northern Italy who rebelled against his rule, even giving him his nickname (meaning "Red Beard" in Italian) because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">his red beard was just that awesome</a>. They respected him so much that after (barely) defeating him in battle they <em>refused to go for full independence</em>, instead settling for a large autonomy that was somewhat <em>less</em> that what they had when Barbarossa started trying to impose his absolute rule.
</li><li> When Ron Dellums, a far-left Oakland Representative, retired from Congress in 1998, many Congressman, even his political opponents, expressed admiration for him. Tom DeLay, yes that Tom DeLay, said ,"one of the most giving, open and stalwart, a real stalwart man when he was Chairman".
</li><li> In 1909 the Indian independence activist and revolutionary <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madan_Lal_Dhingra">Madan Lal Dhingra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was studying in England, assassinated a senior British official, Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie. At his trial he refused to express any regret or contrition, repeatedly declaring that he regarded his act as morally justified. His last words, when he standing on the gallows, were quoted as: "I believe that a nation held down by foreign bayonets is in a perpetual state of war. Since open battle is rendered impossible to a disarmed race, I attacked by surprise. Since guns were denied to me I drew forth my pistol and fired. Poor in wealth and intellect, a son like myself has nothing else to offer to the mother but his own blood. And so I have sacrificed the same on her altar. The only lesson required in India at present is to learn how to die, and the only way to teach it is by dying ourselves. My only prayer to God is that I may be re-born of the same mother and I may re-die in the same sacred cause till the cause is successful. Vande Mataram!'' ("I praise thee mother!"). British politician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who was then serving as First Lord of the Admiralty, privately expressed admiration for Dhingra's act and called the above last words "The Finest Statement ever made in the name of Patriotism". Churchill's fellow politician David Lloyd George (who later served as prime minister) was also reported to feel a similar level of admiration for the patriotism expressed by Dhingra.
</li><li> Many Republicans, especially supporters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, feel this way about Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as detailed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/30/aoc-congress-republicans-1134065">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They admire her determination and her ability to energize people, even though they strongly disagree with many of her ideas. Some have even expressed a willingness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">cooperate with her</a> on issues where they have common ground.
</li><li> John McCain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, opponents during the 2008 presidential election, to the point where Obama gave McCains eulogy at the latters funeral a decade later. McCain would also become this to many Democrats during the administration of Obama's successor, Donald Trump, being seen as a more reasonable and honorable man who embodied the values of the Republican Party that Trump lacked.
</li><li> Despite Ron Paul being among the most right-leaning members of the U.S. House of Representatives for many years and Dennis Kucinich being among the most left-leaning, the two Congressmen and their supporters had high regards for each other, perhaps even higher than they had for some more centrist members of their own party. Both were praised for standing up for their principles even when it meant going against their party, and they were frequently the only members, or among the very few, to vote against a measure that passed the House nearly unanimously.

When released, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Worth</a> heard about the Pinkertons' public relation problems due to their aid in strikebreaking and helped them retrieve a famous painting he'd stolen.
</li><li> Similarly to the above, Charles Earl Bowles, A.K.A "Black Bart" (who despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">name</a> was considered a "gentleman thief" known for his politeness, his non-violent ways and his tendency to leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingCard">poetry</a> at the sites of his robberies) was once described in a police report as follows: "A person of great endurance.

He approached Sony, but the deal fell through when Sony decided it didn't want to support two operating systems.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesTheFirst">James the First</a> expressed admiration for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GuyFawkes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GuyFawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> for his steadfast manner during his interrogation.

</li><li> When RAF fighter pilot Douglas Bader was taken PoW, Nazi ace Adolf Galland paid him the large compliment of allowing him to sit in a Messerschmitt <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bf109" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bf109">Bf 109</a> as a guest of honor - and also kept a gun discreetly pointed at him just in case Bader took it into his head to start the engine and effect a daring escape. The two men remained friends for the rest of Bader's life and Galland was a guest at his funeral.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, they even share a spot in the Tropes Pantheon.
</li><li> During the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union astronauts and cosmonauts alike apparently viewed each other this way, seeing and appreciating the similar risks each took in the frontier days of manned space exploration. They've even sent expressions of mourning for when spacemen from either side died in the course of their work. Similarly, a lot of scientists and engineers often felt honest admiration and some envy for when their counterparts in the other program figured out or achieved something they hadn't quite gotten around to first.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasMore">Thomas More</a> is famous for two reasons: Writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia">Utopia</a></em> (and outright coining the term in the process) and sticking to Catholicism up to the point of martyrdom when his boss and friend King Henry VIII created the Church of England. Come 1980, More, along with Cardinal John Fisher, were officially recognized as martyrs to be venerated by the Church of England itself, likely out of respect to their steadfast faith.
</li><li> On a more minor level, athletes who frequently compete against each other will often establish this dynamic with each other, even if they're on teams that are bitter rivals.
</li><li> Diogenes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> were known for their rivalry, as Diogenes was known to debunk Plato's ideas through mockery. For example, when Plato claimed that man was "a featherless biped", Diogenes plucked a chicken and threw it into one of Plato's lectures, stating "Behold, I've brought you a man!" This caused Plato to revise the definition and say that man is "A featherless biped with broad flat nails."
