</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">not the touchy-feely sort</a> that usually dominates this trope, but he definitely seems to have shades of it — possibly because his own childhood was cut off in such a nightmarish manner. Look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a>, whom Bats adopted solely because he needed it.
<ul><li> He shows similar tendencies in the graphic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em> and several other sources, most likely due to his orphaning at such a young age. He does NOT like people to mess with kids.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">No Man's Land</a></em> novel, he tells Gordon that he won't interfere if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he kills Joker, Joker having just shot Sarah, Gordon's wife. However, he also just kidnapped and violently endangered 30-something babies</span>. In that same arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a> also fulfills this trope. She takes over the Gotham City Park, but winds up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">making it a refuge for all the children orphaned in the earthquake</a>. When the police try to force her out, and are willing to destroy the whole place if they have to in order to defeat her monstrous plants she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/BatmanNoMansLand">eventually turns herself in without a fight so that one of the children can get urgently needed medical attention</a></span>.
</li><li> Batman practically runs an orphanage with the way he keeps taking on kids under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">wing.</a> The list includes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Dick/Robin/Nightwing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Barbara/Batgirl/Oracle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleChildSyndrome">Jason/Robin II</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Tim/Robin III/Red Robin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Damian/Robin V</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Cassandra/Batgirl II/Orphan II</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Stephanie/Spoiler/Robin IV/Batgirl III</a>. Even in the world of <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">it got worse</a> with Dick, Batman still has Carrie Kelly as Robin "DKR." Cynics might point out that all of the aforementioned kids Batman takes in become Robin or/and Batgirl at some point, but Batman has fostered kids temporarily and returned them to normal life. Possibly the best known example of this is in the "You Should've Seen Him" story (Batman #423). Batman finds a brother and sister orphan pair dumpster diving to survive, and works as Bruce to reunite them with a surviving relative. In most cases, the kids <em>insist</em> on joining Batman's crimefighting crusade over his protests. He provides them training, support, and equipment to maximize their chances of survival.
</li><li> One of the most recurring things about Batman is the fact that he's never scary to children, despite being downright <em>blood-chilling</em> to criminals. "The Batman Nobody Knows" (Batman #250) takes this to its logical conclusion. Bruce takes some inner-city kids camping. Naturally they swap scary stories around a campfire, and this being Gotham, all the kids talk about Batman. Their exaggeration makes Bats seem like part demon, part giant, and also "Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Shaft, and Superfly all rolled into one!" Finally, having slipped away during the last story, THE Batman leaps into the firelight. Not only are the kids not scared, they recognize him as Bruce!mu
</li><li> Alex Ross' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Justice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Justice">Justice</a></em> shows what the superheroes would do if the world was ending. Batman would round up as many children as he can and take them to the Batcave for shelter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier">DC: The New Frontier</a></em> used this as an explanation as to why Batman adopted a friendlier look and took in Robin during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>. He didn't like it when a child he tried to rescue ended up being even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrifyingRescuer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrifyingRescuer">more scared of him than the thugs who kidnapped him.</a> When Superman asked him about the changes, all he would tell him is that he intends to scare criminals, not children.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Like her cousin Bruce, Kate Kane also loves kids. She's rescued groups of them on different occasions as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a>, and they always willingly follow her, so they clearly don't find her scary. She's even been attacked by brainwashed children a few times, and has never fought back when it happened, instead electing to evade them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> violent killer. But due to the fact that Deadpool has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">mentality of a child</a>, he often gets along well with children. In fact, most of his heartwarming and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments usually involve children (even though some children may be uncomfortable near him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">good reasons</a>). Try to hurt children in his presence, and he'll come after you like a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">deadly serious</a></em> violent killer.
</li><li> Subverted by a one-off villain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a></em>. She had a good reputation with children and many of them came over to her house to play. How she kept this reputation when kids kept disappearing isn't explained. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After being crippled she sells her soul to a demon that she uses to hunt down more children.</span>
<ul><li> Played straight with Ghost Rider himself being a burning demonic skeleton he is as terrifying as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> as they come, but innocent little children are never victims of his wrath and worthy of his protection.

However, once Marius learns that his target is sacrificing children, he changes his tune.

<ul><li> It usually involves his seeing them as his own kids that he was unable to protect. In one of his more awesome moments, he's tasked with retrieving a little girl in Russia whose blood contains an experimental supervirus along with another Special Forces guy, slaughtering the Russians sent to prevent that from happening. After he escapes (in a nuclear missile), he boards the pickup submarine and refuses to let anyone approach her, resulting in the virus decaying until it's unusable. When Frank is greeted by a large army unit and the general behind the operation, the soldiers are rather iffy about shooting him. Then Nick Fury (who gave him the mission in the first place) stands next to Frank, and the soldiers give up.
</li><li> In another story, Frank is just getting ready to snipe a crime boss from a shooter's nest he'd set up in an alley off Times Square when he hears a noise and turns around to see a little girl asking if he can please help her find her dad. Frank's on a tight schedule because the crime boss won't be in the open for long, but stows his gun immediately and helps the girl. While walking through Times Square he holds her hand, lets her ride on his shoulders, buys her a doll, and keeps her very close. Even when he has to take his eyes off her in order to check his target, he always asks her a question to get her talking so that her voice will let him know where she is. This whole time, he is having <em>very</em> strong flashback memories to being with his own daughter before she died. When they finally find her father in an area that's a little off the beaten path, they run to each other. The dad looks up to Frank, thanking him profusely and saying that he'd just looked away from her for a minute, then just about <em>shits his pants</em> when he realizes he's looking at a scarred, heavily muscled and grim-faced man who's wearing a skull t-shirt and unslinging a sniper rifle. Frank tells the man to stand up and hold still, then uses his shoulder to rest his rifle in order to get a better shot at the crime boss. Frank shoots the crime boss while the man tightly hugs his daughter in order to keep her from seeing what is going on. His mission accomplished and the girl safe, he stows his rifle back under his coat and starts to walk away. Then he pauses, turns around, and tells her father one last thing: "Never look away, <em>not even for a minute.</em>"

Nevertheless, he's got a soft spot for kids. For example, he'll call his former landlady a whore to her face... but not in front of her children.

When Warsaw's Jewish Orphanage was forced to relocate to the municipal Jewish Ghetto in autumn 1939 he moved into the Ghetto to be with them. In August 1942 the Jewish Council of Warsaw deported a number of unproductive demographics in response to the (German) Generalgouvernement's demand that they hand over a certain percentage of their population for 'deportation to the east' (i.e. euthanasia). The orphanage was written off. Even though he was not to be deported and was guaranteed protection by the Jewish Council, Polish Resistance, and reputedly the German Order Police (some say they simply wanted to avert a potential PR disaster, others that they had read his books to their own children), he and his co-director, fellow pedagogist, and lifelong friend Feiga Lipschitz voluntarily accompanied the 192 orphans to keep them calm. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">They were processed by the Treblinka extermination facility on the 6th-7th of August.</a>

Some children who were kept as servants by the German army were trapped in such a building, and called out in fear. The Soviet soldiers who found them immediately formed a defense perimeter and escorted them to safety. Some of the children were adopted into the unit because they were orphans. Years later, one child related:
<div class="indent"> "The one who found us shouted, 'Lads, there are kids in here!' I had never seen men cry."
</div></li><li> Another WWII example: A fairly anti-semitic Polish policeman, known in his town for arresting lots of Jews, was sweeping an abandoned ghetto with other policemen and the Nazis, looking for any hiding Jews. Seeing a ladder leading up into an attic, he climbed the ladder to find a Jewish mother and her children hiding there, picking them out with the light of his lantern. He could have gotten massive rewards and a promotion. But when the SS officer in charge called to him from below to ask if he had found anything, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">he replied, "No," and left.</a> We do not know what happened to that policeman, but the family survived and remembered his action that day.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> song "Lenningrad" tells the story of Viktor (an actual person whom Joel met while touring the Soviet Union in 1987), a former member of the Red Army who, after seeing the horrors of war, became a clown, and found happiness bringing joy to children.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> tried to give himself this image, claiming that his charity work and eccentric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> nature was partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">he hadn't much of a childhood himself</a>. Unfortunately, multiple accusations of child molestation brought against him ruined that, and though he was never <em>actually</em> found guilty of such crimes in court (and friends like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin">Macaulay Culkin</a> vouched for his innocence), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion">they left a black mark on his reputation</a> until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">he died</a>. Bringing up this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">Elephant in the Living Room</a> issue now, instead of just celebrating him for his music and charitable work, inevitably leads to condemnation from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of his fanbase.
</li><li> Similar to Jackson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll">Lewis Carroll</a> was very well known for spending any time he wasn't busy writing (and occasionally time he was) playing with the local children in his garden. And like Jackson, this has given rise to the rumor that his interest in them was more of a pedophilic nature as opposed to a friendly one, especially due to his collecting of naked photos of them once they were finished playing. However, it has been mostly agreed upon that it was more just part of the era of the 1800s that children often played with few to no clothes on, as few could afford play clothes and dirtying their dress clothes would ruin them. It is also reported that Carroll always asked the respective child's parents' consent before photographing them.
</li><li> Actors who play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Doctor</a> are especially known for this, but special mention goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> - both were known for clashing with production staff, and both struggled with mental illness, but <em>always</em> were sweet and lovely to their young fans.
</li><li> Fred Rogers, a man who devoted his life to children, and helped raise a generation of them via <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>. Over the past decade, she's criss-crossed the globe on behalf of UNICEF and UNHCR, often in the company of her significant other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>, and regularly takes time out from her movie shoots to work on some project involving children or refugees (or refugee children). She often keeps her work low-key so as not to have her celebrity status distract from the matter at hand; for instance, at the time of this writing, she and Pitt have visited Bosnia to look into the issue of civilians who haven't been able to return home even 15 years after the war's end, but are making no public appearances.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>. During the last decade of her life, she did tremendous work for UNICEF, virtually becoming the face of the organization. Several months before her death she visited Somalia at the height of that country's famine; the stark photos taken during that event (a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">heartbreaking</a> one showed her, with an incredibly grim expression on her face, cradling a child dying of starvation) helped raise world awareness of the disaster. She was strongly influenced in her work by memories of the hardships (including starvation) that she herself had to endure as a teenager in Nazi-occupied Holland.
</li><li> Actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretHamilton">Margaret Hamilton</a>, best known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">the Wicked Witch of the West</a>, started out as a kindergarten teacher and later during the 1950's, she taught at Sunday school for a time. She actually loved children and doted upon them. Afraid of being typecast, she once appeared on a pair of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></em> episodes as Margaret H. Witch when she helped to clear up any misunderstandings that arose from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> as she "transformed" into a witch by putting on makeup and a costume, showing them that who she was in real life shouldn't be confused with the character she played.
</li><li> Marge Schott, the somewhat-bonkers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10apb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10apb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10apb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">By which we mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacistGrandma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacistGrandma">wildly racist</a></span> owner of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Cincinnati Reds</a> 1984-99 loved kids (despite having no children of her own), and would let them run around the outfield before games at Riverfront Stadium.
</li><li> A non-human variant: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">Grandpaw</a> Mason is an aging feral cat who loves to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZiJkicepzM">snuggle and play with the foster kittens his caretaker brings home.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In fact, working as a foster grandpa most likely helped extend his life (along with the love and care of the human who took him in).
</li><li> Also from the world of baseball, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BabeRuth">Babe Ruth</a> was famous for his love of children and involvement with children's causes. Ruth was notorious in his time for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">drinking, womanizing, carousing, and gluttony</a> (to the point that his only child was an illegitimate daughter), but there's no doubt that he sincerely loved children. Many suspect these had a common cause — Ruth never really properly grew up himself, as he had a hard childhood and then was flung into fame and glory at a young age.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings">Jim Cummings</a> will call children in hospitals and brighten their day by talking to them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a>. And part of the reason he wanted to be involved with Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em> was because he claimed that Tiana (the movie's lead character) looks exactly like his adoptive daughter.
</li><li> 1930s gangster/bank robber John Dillinger once apparently carjacked a family with kids in the back, but made a point of not hurting anyone and patted one of the kids on the head before getting out while reassuring the parents "Don't worry, we like kids."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein">Ed Gein<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, of all people. He was proven to be behind some truly disgusting acts (and suspected of worse), but when it came to kids? Before he was found out and arrested, his neighbors would hire him as a babysitter. He was consistently described as caring and benevolent to the children placed in his care.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a>, in a much less screwed up way than his character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a>. You only have to put on a random VLog or commentary to see how much he cares about children and hates movies that treat them like idiots.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DiamandaHagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DiamandaHagan">Diamanda Hagan</a> is an aunt and loves to spoil her nieces and nephews.
</li><li> There's a reason that most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>'s fanbase consists of children. In fact, he's granted over 500 wishes for the Make a Wish foundation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> veteran Bob McGrath fits this trope to a T, by all accounts; both on- and off-camera, he is as gentle and sweet as can be around the little ones. Naturally, since becoming involved with the show, he has been a devoted advocate of organizations dedicated to children's causes, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrymzwUrpU&amp;feature=share">even once appearing in a PSA for UNICEF<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Interestingly, he started his career as a 50's-60's pop singer, gearing towards a slightly more adult audience; after his first couple of decades on <em>Sesame Street</em>, however, he found some success recording albums of kids' songs.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters">John Waters</a> has talked about teaching a 1st grade class where they do improvs of airplane crashes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> vampire movies. In his own words, "I'm good with kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Even though I look like a child molester.</a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> was, by all accounts, a doting parent and a grandfatherly figure. His academic colleague George Sayer once discovered the professor surrounded by a group of neighborhood children; Tolkien explained quite seriously, "We're playing trains. I'm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>. Puff, puff."
</li><li> Oddly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>. He was very fond of kids and would spend hours playing with them — when his friends came to visit, he loved playing with their children. He and his wife never had any, but given that both are recorded to have been quite sad that they never had any offspring of their own, it's suspected that they simply couldn't. (Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Stalin</a> twisted this by consistently portraying Lenin as a friend and protector of children in his propaganda, even though Lenin, who despised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">personality cults</a>, would have been appalled by the extensive use of his image by Stalin's regime and particularly by the manipulative tactics of having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">child-abuser</a> Stalin use his image this way.)
<ul><li> Subverted in the execution of Alexei Nikolaevich, heir to the Russian throne (who was only thirteen years old, and was completely innocent), as Lenin approved of it after the fact and did nothing to punish those responsible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Leon Trotsky</a> even suggested in his journal that Lenin ordered the execution of the Russian royal family himself, though to this day there is no definitive proof.
</li></ul></li><li> During his stint as the Mayor of Carmel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> would use the position's modest salary to host ice cream parties for the town's children.
</li><li> Yet another WWII example: in the last year of the war, Soviet planes bombed facilities in the German countryside in support of military operations. During one such run it happened that two Wehrmacht soldiers went to their home village and on the way found several children playing in the woods. When they noticed the planes approaching, rather than leave them alone they gathered them and attempted to flee, which then turned out futile. So they simply shielded the children with their own bodies. The two soldiers died but the children (fortunately) managed to survive. The grave marking this action still exists near the ruins of Castle Falkenstein.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> <em>adored</em> children. Tragically unable to have any themselves, he and his wife hosted frequent parties for any and all children in the neighborhood where they lived.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff">Boris Karloff</a> loved kids and used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor">dress up as Santa Claus to deliver presents to a children's hospital</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EijiTsuburaya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EijiTsuburaya">Eiji Tsuburaya</a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">Ultra Series</a></em> fame. He cared deeply about children and worked very hard to make his work kid-friendly. He was quoted as saying to his crew "Remember, children will be watching, don't show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">anything too cruel</a>," and "Don't destroy the dreams of children".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder">Gene Wilder</a> recognized just how iconic his role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka</a> was and adored how children always lit up when they recognized him. For the last three years of his life, he suffered from Alzheimer's but this was not made public until after he died. Why? Because he wanted them to still feel comfortable approaching him and not feel sorry for "poor old Mr. Wonka." He didn't want to be responsible for one less smile in the world. It especially applied to his relationship with the child actors for <em>Willy Wonka</em>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship">became close friends with Peter Ostrum</a> (who played Charlie). When it came time to shoot his infamous outburst at the end of the film, Wilder desperately wanted to tell Peter just how mad he was going to be, because he didn't want to ruin their friendship. Julie Dawn Cole (who played Veruca) and Denise Nickerson (who played Violet) absolutely adored working with him as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MasterChef">MasterChef</a> Junior. Despite how he acts on Hell's Kitchen, in real life, he's actually a very nice and friendly mentor, and he's generally much more kind and friendly with child-contestants, and even lets them stick his head in guacamole if they win a challenge. Hes also got five kids of his own.
</li><li> Despite his self-admitted reputation as a "cantankerous old man" (his own words), Prince Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh (husband of Queen Elizabeth II) adores children, and has sponsored over 200 children's charities and schools in Great Britain, and loved "playing footie in the garden" with his kids and the dogs when they were all younger.
</li><li> It's fairly well-known that a lot of the same convicts who have committed the most heinous of crimes are pretty fond of kids, to the point that if a convicted child abuser (or worse, child <em>molester</em>) isn't put in solitary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">he's likely to get shanked</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">or worse</a>.
<ul><li> It's for this reason that both prison guards and former inmates will readily assert that child murderers and molesters are better off if they get the death penalty, which usually means being segregated away from the general prison population. When these people are placed in with the prisoners, they very quickly find out that not only do all the other prisoners want to kill them, but also to make <em>damn</em> certain that they suffer a lot before they die...
</li><li> Two murderers had been placed in the same cell, and were together for a year. The only difference was that one had murdered adults, while the other had raped and killed a little girl. When the adult-murderer found out <em>exactly</em> what his cellmate had done, he proceeded to beat him to death.
</li><li> Similarly, communities that otherwise might come across as hostile or indifferent to the police will often step up if a child was victimized.
</li><li> According to a lawsuit filed against a Midwest prison, a man who spent years raping his young stepdaughter was himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">raped multiple times by a cellmate</a> specifically to make him feel like his victim.
</li><li> Two Words: Katie's Revenge. A man in Indiana was convicted of molesting and killing a girl named Katie. After his fellow inmates found out about it, they held him down and gave him a nice tattoo: the words "Katie's Revenge". Across his forehead. In huge letters.
</li><li> Similarly, it's said that women who are jailed for abusing or killing children (double if the kids are her own) are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PariahPrisoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PariahPrisoner">the absolute lowest of the low</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsBehindBars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsBehindBars">women's prisons</a>. Understandable, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">many of the prisoners are mothers themselves</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt">Chris Pratt</a>'s pastimes includes visiting children in hospitals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot">Gal Gadot</a> seems to share the character she's most well known for playing's love for and gift with children. While filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em>, she visited a children's hospital in her costume to spend time with kids. She took time at San Diego Comic Con in 2017 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-XZiaEDuY">to comfort a little girl who was crying because she was so excited to meet her hero.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a> liked to portray himself this way, having created a reality show <em>Jim'll Fix It</em> that was about him using his wealth and connections to make peoples wishes come true, mostly children. In interviews however, he always admitted that he never actually did like children all that much. A year after his death, it was discovered that he was actually using his show to get close to children to molest them.
</li><li> Surprising to some, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Axl Rose</a>. Likely due to his crappy childhood, he tends to go out of his way to treat kids well, even hosting Halloween parties at his home (even if he couldn't resist the urge to troll them by making them think that people are supposed to set up Halloween trees and get presents). A concert in 2017 showed that he won't hesitate to scream at security being too rough with a child, even if he has mellowed out in his age.
</li><li> Supposedly, Rex Garrod, the Suffolk inventor who designed the car from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brum">Brum</a></em> and participated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em> with the robot Cassius. While competing as the captain of Team Cassius, Rex was known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">gentlemanly competitor</a> who would take on the house robots to stop them damaging the competitor's robot if a child was on the opposing team - he wanted to encourage children to get into engineering and didn't want them to be demoralized by their creations being wrecked. Rex sadly passed away in April 2019 after a long battle with Alzheimer's, aged 75.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland">Tom Holland</a> frequently visits children's hospitals in costume as Spider-Man and will often times do tricks and flips for them.
</li><li> The late Israeli singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OfraHaza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OfraHaza">Ofra Haza</a> had always been fond of children and had truly wanted to become a mother. She even recorded an album called <em>Songs for Children</em>. Seven years after her death, part of the public park in the Hatikvah Quarter (where Haza grew up) in Tel Aviv became known as "Gan Ofra", or "Ofra's Park", and it even has a playground to honour her love for children and her connection to her old home.
</li><li> Hồ Chí Minh built up an image of this. Several of his famous photographs are of him being affectionate towards and/or surrounded by children, feeding them, celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival/Children's Holiday with them, etc. Allegedly this is because (in his words) he had neither family nor children, and considered the Vietnamese people his family. He wrote poems about children and their education, as well as letters (which includes the creed of the Young Pioneer Organization), and mentioned the importance of their education and happiness throughout his career and in his will.
