Well...so what? That doesn't mean you can't still enjoy their company in <em>this</em> one. Of course, people might think you're a bit <em>strange</em> if you dress your beloved's corpse in formal attire, tape a spaghetti fork to their hands and try to have a nice, one-sided conversation with them every evening over dinner, but they just wouldn't understand, not having suffered such a crushing loss themselves. Decomposition? What decomposition? Your loved one looks just as good as they did the day they... stopped moving for themselves and became less talkative. But they're still alive! Yes, they <em>are.</em> Anyone who tells you anything different is <em>obviously</em> confused, or jealous of your relationship. Yes...that's it...they're jealous, and they must be destroyed as soon as possible...before they're able to spread any...<em>nasty</em> rumors about you...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>As you can probably see, the (living) people at the center of this are usually not "firing on all cylinders" â€” assuming, of course, that they still have <em>any</em> cylinders left to fire. This is usually because they just can't accept the loss of someone who was close to them, and would rather live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">in an alternate self-created reality where that person is still alive.</a> This loss, of course, can be even <em>more</em> crushing if <em>they themselves</em> were responsible for their beloved's death in some way.
</p><p>The lover or "protector" of the corpse will frequently speak to them and imagine them speaking back, although this is not to be confused with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation">Dead Person Conversation</a>, which is a conversation that <em>may actually be taking place</em> between a character and a spirit from the next world. Or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead">Talking to the Dead</a>, where a character expects no answer but has to vent. No. In order for a situation to qualify as Mummies At The Dinner Table, one of the participants must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTropes">stone-cold dead</a> and the other must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessTropes">stone-cold crazy</a>. Needless to say, the living one will often come across as a bit creepy to other people, even those who know nothing about their cosy little private life. Sometimes, however, the obsessed mourner will appear to be absolutely normal and personable â€” up until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABooCorpse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABooCorpse">Peek-a-Boo Corpse</a> moment when the heroine accidentally walks into the room where their "beloved" is sitting. Then the mourner will go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, and a classic horror chase will follow which may or may not end in the death of the hapless discoverer.

This is often played for comedy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">the shows where this kind of thing is apt to appear</a>.
</p><p>There is also an evil variant, with a mortal foe instead of a friend or lover. Note that these cases only fit the trope if the keeper treats the corpse as if it were a live captive; more commonly, the villain knows perfectly well that the victim is deceased and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay">keeping the body around</a> as a memento, a trophy, and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">a warning to others</a>.
</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneHorror">Mundane Horror</a>. Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">I Love the Dead</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic">Necromantic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoveToDismember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoveToDismember">A Love to Dismember</a>. If the character can't believe or accept that someone has just died, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp">Please Wake Up</a> (if the denial grows into systematic self-deception, that trope can evolve into this one). If the character deceives <em>other</em> people while knowing the truth himself, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorpseHesAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorpseHesAlive">Of Corpse He's Alive</a>. If the target is not dead but merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">pining for the fjords</a>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">Dude, She's Like, in a Coma!</a>.
</p><p>This trope also does not apply to a person who is fully aware that the loved one is dead and treats the corpse as simply a(n often disturbing) form of memento. Such behaviour usually indicates mental problems, but of entirely different sorts.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> has an episode where a woman in a fishing village, fearing her sister will move away and leave her, kills her and keeps her corpse tied up in a shed. The woman then forms an equally creepy obsession with the murdered woman's daughter, who barely manages to avoid being killed and preserved in the same way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>, briefly: After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Soi takes a sword for Nakago</span>, he rides around with her body for the next while. The example might be too subtle for the trope if this treatment weren't considerably better than anyone <em>living</em> had ever received from him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</a></em> uses this in its first chapter: After a pop star fulfills a suicide pact with her boyfriend, her father (who had prevented them from being together and triggered their suicides) steals her corpse and keeps it in his home. It soon transpires he was so obsessive with her that she likely would have killed herself <em>without</em> the pact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RequiemFromTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RequiemFromTheDarkness">Requiem from the Darkness</a></em> has an example with guilt and denial.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> Profiles book there is a bonus manga (and <em>Brotherhood</em> OVA) where an alchemist returned a girl to life, losing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eyeballs</a> in the process. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In reality, the girl...<strong>may</strong> have come back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">in a way</a>, but the girl Ed and Al meet is someone the family picked up from the orphanage who looked like their daughter. The real girl was brought back as a wizened husk, which can still...sort of move or at least breathe, meaning this may also fit nicely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>. The family refuses to get rid of their corpse daughter and refuse to let the blind alchemist know he failed.</span>
</li><li> Instead of a love interest or stalkee, in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess">Scrapped Princess</a></em> book, it's the beloved daughter of an early villain, whom he thinks is still clinging to life.

She eventually starts talking to the corpse as if it were alive once everything starts to crumble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em>, Yuno <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> keeps her parent's dead bodies in a cage (that they kept <em>her</em> in to punish her), and frequently talks with them about the stuff that happens to her during school</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>, Hibana is shown talking with her dead mother (who is shown to be a skeleton hanging) at home, apparently "taking orders" from her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itsuki and Sensui's last scene ever has both of them inside an alternate dimension, with the still-living Itsuki gently speaking to Sensui's dead body as if he still was alive.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Snifff...</a>

The corpse of Fai's dead brother Yuui (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">or rather, Yuui's dead brother Fai</a>) is kept preserved in the hopes of possible resurrection. This also involved the creation of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> in the image of the twins' mother, whose purpose was to look after and take care of the corpse, though the extent to which she did so was never elaborated on.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RayearthOVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RayearthOVA">Rayearth OVA</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zagato sacrificed himself in a ritual to try and prevent the downfall of Cephiro. He failed. Now his perfectly-preserved corpse sits upon his throne at the very heart of Emeraude's castle, and the Princess herself fawns over him, but she's too far gone to realize he's dead.</span>
</li><li> Faust VIII of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> embodies this trope quite well. After his wife Eliza is shot and killed in a break-in, he spends all of his time trying to find a way to resurrect her but in the meantime, he still carries around her whole skeleton around with him. He refers to her as his 'Dear Eliza' and even holds hands with her reanimated skeleton on occasion...Suggesting to him that she's dead forever is...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Not a good idea to say the least</a>.

It's not clear if she actually believes them to be alive at times, or if she's just messing with the still-living victims though.
</li><li> A funny "dead animal" example of this trope appears in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StartTheRevolutionWithoutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StartTheRevolutionWithoutMe">Start the Revolution Without Me</a></em>. One of the Corsican Brothers, Phillippe de Sisis (played by Gene Wilder), has a psychotic attraction to his stuffed falcon.

Same concept). He talks to them and even introduces them (in caveman grunt-talk, 'Ugh! Schtemlo! OOgh! Eshtablio!' etc.) to the heroine, Roxy (for whom Eegah has the major hots) and her dad, both whom he has captive.

The serial killer in the movie kidnaps teenage girls, puts them in a soundproof room, puts them in an elegant gown or dress, and THEN duct tapes their feet to a concrete block, afterwards he proceeds to take them out into the middle of the lake, and then drop them to the bottom to sink. He also likes to scuba dive out to his "garden" and clean away any detritus accumulating around them and makes sure to straighten up their clothes. The conditions of the bodies range from skeletal, to decomp, to recently dead.

</li><li> Nancy Etchemendy's <em>Cat in Glass</em> is a collection of short stories that range from inventive and appealing to downright macabre. In <em>Lunch at Etienne's</em>, a woman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets her toddler ready to go (he's mad and won't speak to her, and she has to carry him), gets annoyed by the quantities of dust on the coats in her wardrobe, can't get out the blocked front door (why <em>hasn't</em> the landlord fixed it yet?), walks down the street (are her neighbors <em>still</em> not speaking to her? and what's all this white stuff on the ground, it's too early for snow), enters her favorite restaurant, and meets her best friend for lunch (speechless). She catches a glimpse of the mirror, which reflects an old woman in rags sitting next to two corpses in the broken rubble of what used to be a restaurant. Stunned with horror, she shakes it off and goes back to talking with her best friend about how the service at this place is always <em>horrible</em>.</span>

He claims that she hasn't decomposed at all, though whether this is true or just his delusion is never revealed Â– either way, it's disturbing.
</li><li> In an R.L. Stine novel, <em>Halloween Night 2</em>, the heroine is afraid that her (previously psychotic) friend is still assaulting her. Meanwhile, her new friend on the block is getting REALLY into Halloween, including these two really realistic-looking skeletons for decoration. Needless to say, it turns out that the previously psychotic friend is harmless, her NEW friend is psychotic, and the skeletons are her dead parents. The girl alters between sly lies ("They're just Halloween decorations my parents put up") and complete obliviousness as to her parent's real state of physical health (not to mention decomposition).

Sadly, while they can keep her moving and give her some protection, by the time the series focuses on the problems with Merolyn, the dead Queen has become quite fragrant and partially decomposed. To make matters worse, the King has gotten over his wife's death, but cannot end the charade due to political reasons that would plunge his city into chaos or see a despot on the throne. The fact that it was originally punishable by death to mention the Queen's "condition" means that everyone else has to go along with the horrific charade. It's actually a relief to the King when Joram's anti-magic darksword destroys the enchantment, "killing" the Queen.

The princess isn't living in denial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">she is completely ignorant of the concept of death</a>. As a result, she believes that her pet rabbit Herman is still alive and fusses over him constantly, even dragging him on a leash for walks.
</li><li> Played hilariously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em> when Eric moves into a great apartment with a nice though eccentric guy who doesn't seem to care if Eric pays rent (there's also a hot girl next door who routinely locks herself out of her apartment while wearing a towel.) Eric is somewhat disturbed when he finds that the guy treats his (dead) stuffed parrot like a live pet; he finally bolts when the guy starts talking about bringing out his mom. We never see her, but it's heavily implied that she's dead, too.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror">Masters of Horror</a></em> episode "Family" has a variation of this trope, whereby George Wendt's character kills random people, melts off their flesh, and uses their skeletons as mannequins to create his vision of the perfect family. This counts as an example due to the repeated conversations and arguments he holds with them, including when he "murders" his "wife".

The song's chorus features the line, "Last dance with Mary Jane."
</li><li> Casket Casey's album <em>Coffin' Up Bones</em> focuses on a female necrophiliac named Casey, with songs like "Cold Flesh and Blood", and such cheery lyrics as:
<div class="indent"> Have you met my groom?

</li><li> In Jimmy Cross' "I Want My Baby Back", which parodies "teen tragedy songs", that were popular in the '60s, the narrator digs up his girlfriend's grave, (who died in an accident) crawls into her coffin, and closes the lid. Complete with sound effects.

They reconcile in hell, however, and come back to get married and engage in mass murder.
</li><li> The music video to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a>'s "<em>Inside The Fire</em>" involves the character (lead singer David Draiman) doing this with his then-recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> girlfriend.

"Even in Death"'s opening verse:
<div class="indent"><em>Give me a reason to believe that you're gone.</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>I see your shadow so I know they're all wrong.</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Moonlight on the soft brown earth,</em>

</div><div class="indent"><em>Steadying my hands through the blistering pain.</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Anxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you,</em>

</li><li> "Her Clockwork Heart" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VernianProcess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VernianProcess">Vernian Process</a> is about an inventor who creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">clockwork heart</a> for his dying lover. She lives on...sort of.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTigerLillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTigerLillies">The Tiger Lillies</a> have (among other things) the song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH2VayGYd5I">Larder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", about a dead girl in a larder:

SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER. SHE IS THERE SHE IS THERE IN THE LARDER.</em>
</div></li><li> Creature Feature's song <em>A Corpse In My Bed</em> is about a man saving the corpse of his old girlfriend.
<div class="indent"> <em>Her Skin Is Dry And Body Full Of Dust <br/>One Day I'm Afraid She Just Might Combust <br/>I Could Never Think Of Leaving Her Side <br/>Even Though It's Been Years Since She Died</em>
</div></li><li> Insane Clown Posse built a career out of this trope. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15fCvyz_xT8">"Cemetery Girl"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejge52JAISI&amp;feature=related">"Dead Body Man"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being prime examples. "What kinda SICK FUCK WOULD STEAL FOUR DEAD BODIES ANYWAY? Details at Eleven."
</li><li> Melodic Death Metal band The Black Dahlia Murder has at least two songs of this, both prone to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerkers</a>, <em>A Vulgar Picture</em> and <em>Deathmask Divine</em>.
</li><li> Gnarls Barkley's "Necromancer" is about not only keeping the body but being the killer as well, although some lyrics mention the idea of suicide. Includes the lines "Did you hear what I said?/With this ring, I thee wed/A body in my bed/She was cool when I met her, but I think I like her better dead." Although the lyrics make it clear that the dead person in question is only metaphorically dead, having been consumed by an addiction to drugs.
</li><li> Played for laughs by country artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie">Joe Diffie</a> in "Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox," when he requests that the audience do this for him when he's dead. He even asks for a stiff drink and a suitable date: a blonde mannequin. In the music video, a pair of friends do exactly this for their deceased buddy, breaking into the funeral home and carrying his body out between them. They make the corpse nod to the waitress, wave at a blonde a the bar, and clap to the music, while passing off his tendency to fall over as ordinary drunkenness, before finally leaving the corpse propped against the bar's jukebox at closing time.
<div class="indent">Well I ain't afraid of dying, it's the thought of being dead.
</div><div class="indent">I want to go on being me once my eulogy's been read.
</div><div class="indent">Don't spread my ashes out to sea, don't lay me down to rest.
</div><div class="indent">You can put my mind at ease if you fulfill my last request.
</div></li><li> There's an old Spanish folk song about a man having a romantic night with his newlywed wife, who just happens to have deceased several years ago. The last lines are more or less translated to:
<div class="indent"> He took the skeleton to the valley
</div><div class="indent">whispered sweet nothings to her under the stars
</div><div class="indent"> and then fell asleep forever
</div><div class="indent"> holding his beloved's rigid skeleton.
</div></li><li> The Kisschasey song 'Black Dress' somehow manages to be a fairly sweet song about this. It opens:
<div class="indent">I dug you up this morning and took you home,
</div><div class="indent">To have you here beside me cold but close.
</div><div class="indent">I made my mind up last night
</div><div class="indent">That heaven just can't have you.
</div></li><li> There's a Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds song called Dead Man In My Bed, where a woman is complaining to a singer about the titular dead man. (He's smelly, inconsiderate and doesn't want to <em>do</em> anything.)
</li><li> Mirel Wagner's "No Death", in which she takes the part of a man making love to his lover after she has died.
<div class="indent">I move my hips
</div><div class="indent">In her I am home
</div><div class="indent">I'll keep on loving
</div><div class="indent">Till the marrow dries from her bones
</div></li><li> Possibly happens towards the end of "The Doctor's Wife'' by The Steampunk Quartet; by this point the narrator's patient is legally dead, her organs kept viable by a bunch of machines, the rest of her body "destroyed", and he still hears her pleading for him not to let her go.

Since then her boyfriend has been spending his time roaming the world looking for a magic item that can bring her back from the dead (a task that would appear to be futile given that the game's world hasn't seen magic for a thousand years), visiting her corpse, and projecting her onto every woman he meets. His persistence does pay off without him having shown any signs of insanity, so... that's okay then? She is able to return, briefly, late in the game, long enough to ask him to move on and forgive himself for her death, before passing on again.

</li><li> Perhaps the squickiest real-life example: Carl Tanzler, a radiologist in 1930s Key West, Florida, who developed a morbid obsession for one of his young female patients. After she died, he built a mausoleum for her, but apparently, that wasn't enough, so he carted away her body, hid it in his house, preserved it as best he could, and lived with her "as man and wife" for many years until her family discovered the body. Tanzler was arrested for graverobbing but was ultimately released, because the statute of limitations on the crime had expired. (Which shows you just how long the "relationship" went on...)
<ul><li> A similar case took place in Japan in 1959. Dr. Karsuaburo Miyamoto was unable to accept his wife's death, so he embalmed the body and kept her in their conjugal bed for ten years before he was caught. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.trivia-library.com/b/strange-history-and-news-of-weird-trivia-1959-to-1967.htm">Source<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Peavey family of New Hampshire had a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,297495,00.html">mummified stillborn infant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a sort of heirloom for 90 years until a child let the secret slip and the state ordered that the body be buried. Though the family engaged in some playful acts with the body, like giving it cards on holidays and a dried fish for a pet, they never fully enacted this trope. (Someone in the past might have, however, considering the body was left unburied so long).
<ul><li> Someone dug out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gnsBYieDL6mf_U5L8W7RFhNoo6BwD9FG8QL80">the grave<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of that unfortunate corpse
</li></ul></li><li> Ed Gein, the inspiration behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Norman Bates</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">Leatherface</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">Jame "Buffalo Bill" Gumb</a>.
</li><li> Then there was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_of_Castile">Queen Juana of Castile<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, queen regent in the early 16th century, who was said to have kept her husband's body around for years after his death, and definitely did so for several months until the church stopped her. Otherwise known as Joanna the Mad. Her husband was known as Philip the Handsome though. So the defining attributes of either could be at fault for her actions.
</li><li> Similar to Queen Juana, it is reported that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Raleigh">Elizabeth, Lady Raleigh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> carried her husband Sir Walter's embalmed head around with her until her death.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.perpetualpet.net/">Perpetual Pet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a company that will freeze-dry and mount your pets if you can't bear to let them go.
</li><li> Gustav II Adolf's wife kept his embalmed corpse around for far longer than was considered proper. When he was buried she had apparently removed his heart and kept it in a box. Eventually, the royal council had to step in, take the heart away and send her daughter off to be raised by someone a bit saner.
<ul><li> Gustav was well aware of his wife's mental state: Before leaving for Germany to be made into this trope, he made it clear to his royal council <em>that under no circumstances</em> was his wife to have any say in the Regency. Before chalking this down to simple 17th-century misogyny, recall that this was the father of Sweden's Queen Christina who had arranged for her to succeed with absolute power.
</li></ul></li><li> Animals occasionally do this with their dead infants. It's slightly less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> than when humans do it, for some reason.
<ul><li> Maybe because the other animals' reaction is much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> as they eat the corpses of their infants.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a tale (probably apocryphal) about a drearily melodramatic stage play that ended the first act with the male lead cradling the corpse of his beloved and asking the rhetorical question "What should I do?". The second night, a wag in the audience shouted back "Fuck her while she's still warm!". On subsequent nights, many members of the audience repeated the riff. According to the legend, the play closed after a week.
<ul><li> So, like an ancient version of what people do at showings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em>?
</li></ul></li><li> Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, was dissected after he died, and his skeleton was outfitted with a wax head and stuffed into his clothes filled out with hay. The 'body' is kept in public display at the University College London. It has been brought out to meetings of the College Council on at least two occasions, where Bentham was listed as being "present, but not voting."
</li><li> Former Senator Rick Santorum's wife gave birth prematurely and their son died two hours after his birth. Santorum decided to take the corpse home with him for a day and introduced it to his living children as their brother (he returned the body the next day). Santorum still speaks of his late son in the present tense. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61804-2005Apr17?language=printer">Article here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Capuchin catacombs of Palermo: Originally the catacombs were intended only for dead Capuchin friars. However, in the following centuries, it became a status symbol for locals to be entombed into the Capuchin catacombs. Some of the bodies were embalmed and others enclosed in sealed glass cabinets. Monks were preserved with their everyday clothing and sometimes with ropes they had worn as a penance. Relatives (including children) would visit to pray for the deceased and also to maintain the body in presentable condition. In their wills, local luminaries would ask to be preserved in certain clothes or even to have their clothes changed at regular intervals.
<ul><li> One of the most touching residents of the catacombs, and definitely the cutest, is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalia_Lombardo">Rosalie Lombardo.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> King Herod of Judea (a.k.a. the one that tried to kill Jesus as a baby in the Bible) grew so paranoid later in his life that he had his beloved wife, Miriam, executed for treason. He deeply regretted this and supposedly had her corpse preserved with honey.
</li><li> In the earliest days of photography, exposure times were so long that taking clear pictures of young children was virtually impossible, as they just couldn't sit still long enough. One morbid sideline for early photographers was taking pictures of <em>dead</em> children, dressed up and posed as if alive so that bereaved families could have a photograph to remember their lost child by.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> actually take it one step further - when <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kutschera">Franz Kutschera<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was killed a week before his wedding, they didn't bother with a funeral and simply put his corpse at the altar nonetheless. Since it was all about the "perfect race" and the bride getting pregnant beforehand, no one saw any problem with that.
</li><li> Legend has it that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_of_Portugal">King Peter I<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portugal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portugal">Portugal</a>, whose lover InÃªs de Castro was murdered by nobles due to some court intrigue, grew so mad with grief that he exhumed her corpse, had her dressed like a queen and seated in the throne forcing the nobles to kiss her hand (likely to humiliate them) and the clergy to marry them so that she could become queen posthumously. No wonder he was also known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Peter the Cruel</a>"...
</li><li> The extremely macabre story of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Moskvin">Anatoly Moskvin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: as a deep believer in celtic druid practices of "talking to the dead", he would sometimes sleep on the grave of recently deceased children and whenever a spirit "mentioned it wants to live", he would dig the body out, dry it with salt and baking soda, then carry it home. There he would wrap them in cloth, put wax masks colored with nail polish on them and thus create "dolls" with which he would eat, sleep and play, celebrate their birthdays, read stories and sing songs as well as watch cartoons. He did this for about twenty years, finally getting caught with 26 "dolls".
