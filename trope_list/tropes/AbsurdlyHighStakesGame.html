But, as anyone who's watched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a> on television can attest, the same games that are fun to play can be painfully boring to watch, as spectators have no stake in the proceedings and do not experience the thrill of winning.
</p><p>Therefore, storytellers will crank the stakes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by causing characters to bet enormous sums of money well above the table limits of a casino game. Cars, houses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostHimInACardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostHimInACardGame">family members</a>, organs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">their life</a>, or other non-liquid assets they can't afford to lose will be wagered by a desperate, cash starved gambler.
</p><p>The item wagered is usually not appraised, with no agreement made about what reward the player should receive in the unlikely event he does, somehow, win the game. (Especially common in poker, where the rule that all "holding" players must have contributed equally to the pot is easily ignored.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Losers will honor the bet even though there is no legal grounds compelling them to follow through. This is usually justified by setting the game in an underground gambling facility, possibly operated by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMillionaire">Eccentric Millionaire</a>, where unconventional bets are accepted and violence can be used to collect on debts.
</p><p>Players are rarely <em>forced</em> to play these games or make the absurdly high wager.
They are generally given a choice of whether or not to participate, even if the alternative is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">another bad situation</a>. Often, the wager is made due to overconfidence, or an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByGamblingDebts">escape from gambling debts</a>.
</p><p>The games are usually based on skill, not simply luck. When the player inevitably loses, they will invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> to avoid paying out.

She has played thousands of games of Gungi and <em>never</em> lost once, near the end of her life becoming skilled enough she was for all intents and purposes impossible to beat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Daniel J. D'arby in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em> has the power to take the souls of whoever loses to him in a game, which he uses successfully against Polnareff and Joseph. When Jotaro faces him in a game of poker, Jotaro loses half of his soul on one hand, then ramps the stakes up massively for the second. Jotaro bets his own soul, Avdol's, <em>and</em> Kakyoin's to get back the ones taken. Jotaro then bets the soul of <em>his mother</em> (because she would die if their mission was a failure), against D'arby revealing the power of DIO's Stand (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier">and facing a certain, horrible death</a> as a consequence). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jotaro wins only through magnificent bluffing, putting this all on a hand he didn't even look at. D'arby is so shocked by Jotaro's confidence that he himself becomes too afraid to call Jotaro's bluff. He passes out, thus forfeiting. Jotaro's hand turned out to be worthless.</span>
</li><li> Later on the heroes encounter D'arby's younger brother Terrence, who has a similar power but prefers to play video games. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jotaro has to cheat to win this time, because Terrence's Stand gives him the power to "read" a person's aura, letting him predict what his opponents will do by asking them simple "yes or no" questions. He gets around this by having his grandpa Joseph control the game secretly using his Stand so that Terrence can no longer figure out his strategy.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Part 4</a> features two examples.

Unfortunately, the alien has no idea of subtlety, resulting in increasingly improbable rolls. Rohan knows Josuke is cheating, but isn't sure <em>how</em>, and raises the stakes to betting <em>fingers</em>. Rohan almost completely chops off his pinky and says that Josuke can heal it if and only if he can keep cheating successfully, but if Rohan can suss out his trick he'll be chopping off one of Josuke's fingers as punishment <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i54l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0i54l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i54l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Josuke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit">Stand</a> Crazy Diamond can restore things to their original state, including injured people, but he can't heal himself so this is a major risk for him</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The day is ultimately saved when Rohan's house catches fire due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarPoweredMagnifyingGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolarPoweredMagnifyingGlass">misplaced magnifying glass</a>; Josuke quickly heals Rohan while he's distracted and beats a hasty retreat. He walks away with nothing, while Rohan pays 7 million yen to repair his house and his hatred of Josuke gets even stronger.</span>
<ul><li> Later in the series Rohan encounters one of the super-powered assassins created by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yoshikage Kira's father using the Stand Arrow</span>: a boy whose Stand lets him steal another person's Stand if he can beat them three times out of five at Rock-Paper-Scissors. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It comes down to the wire, but Rohan wins in the end by physically beating the boy to damage his confidence.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Part 6</a> has Miraschon, whose Stand allows her to automatically collect the wager of a bet whenever her opponent loses. The problem is that if you don't have enough money to pay her, her Stand will take your body parts (like your liver) to cover your bet - and is completely invincible while doing so. On top of that, she can freely cheat all she wants; but, if her opponents even <em>thinks</em> of cheating, they automatically lose. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, if Miraschion falls unconscious, her Stand automatically deactivates. So Jolyne beats her up and recovers the stolen liver</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em>: The entire premise of the show revolves around this. Over the course of the show the main character bets his freedom, his life, and various body parts, in order to win money. <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/kaiji-25.jpg">These fingers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> are being bet on a game of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drawing lots from a tissue box!</span>.
</li><li> The central setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kakegurui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kakegurui">Kakegurui</a></em> has a vast underground gambling scene where millions and occasionally <em>billions</em> of yen are wagered on a daily basis on everything from poker to roulette to rock-paper-scissors.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em>: Throughout the story, the stakes have never been more than money. However, the money involved ranges from hundreds of millions to billions of yen, and the losers are expected to pay back <em>every</em> yen they lose, with the Liar Game officials promising they will do "whatever is necessary" to collect on those debts.
<ul><li> At one point the characters discuss the possibility that the company would be willing to enslave their debtors, which is more befitting this trope; one character states that if she loses, Nao might be forced into prostitution to pay her debts.
</li><li> Played with in "24-Shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a>", which was played with a special prop gun and "bullets" which only make a loud bang without actually firing any projectile. However, a player who fires one has to pay 50 million yen. And the game continues until all 6 "bullets" out of the 24 chambers have been fired. It's obviously better than dying, but each team is looking at potentially racking up 300 million yen (over US $3 million) in debt.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LifeIsMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LifeIsMoney">Life Is Money</a></em>, the losers die violent deaths and the winners make more money with each death. (Note: Nobody is required to lose the game. If everyone lives, they will all win 50 million yen.) For Meguru, the stakes are even higher; if he doesn't win 100 million yen (or at least enough that it will be 100 million yen combined with what he's already earned) his younger sister will never receive a surgery she needs to survive.

<ul><li> The entire world of Disboard revolves around this trope. Tet, the One True God of Disboard after the great war, forbade all robbery, war and murder after he rose to power. Disputes are decided by games - enforced via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract">Magically Binding Contract</a> - where both participants wager things they agree are of equal value. These things can be anything from money to servitude to entire kingdoms.
</li><li> One of the first thing that Sora and Shiro do after becoming king is bet Imanity's Race Piece—meaning that if they lose, Imanity will <em>lose their rights as a sapient species</em>, and no longer be protected from robbery, war, and murder. Worse, what they get if they win is relatively minor in comparison, just some lands that they don't need and lost years ago. Their people are understandably upset about this, and riots break out. Turns out the whole point was to bait the enemy into a game they otherwise wouldn't play, because it would be far too suspicious to pass up such a good bet.
</li></ul></li><li> The game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OneOuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OneOuts">One Outs</a></em> is technically just baseball. However, the main character is a pitcher with a bizarre contract that grants him money for every strike, and penalized him hugely for every run he lets through. This leads to some intricate and convoluted ways of 'winning'.
</li><li> The Davy Back Fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a series of contests between pirate crews. After each game, the captain of the winning crew gets to take something, <em>anything</em>, from the losing crew- Whether it be personal property, their Jolly Roger, or even crew mates! "Silver Fox" Foxy has built a massive crew of at least 500 by winning people in these games, and actually won Chopper for a short time before the Straw Hats won their doctor back. Furthermore, he's a total cheat who goes out of his way to rig things in his crew's favor, whether its interfering in a race, or having a crooked referee for a ball game. Ultimately, Foxy loses to Luffy in the final boxing match, and Luffy (Not wanting any of Foxy's crew), takes Foxy's flag, leaving a horribly-drawn replacement.

The man then offers to play Jin- if Jin wins, he gets a large pouch of gold; if he loses, the man wins his life- the phrasing is ambiguous as to whether that means slavery or immediate death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Since he needs the money</a>, Jin accepts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral">Spiral</a></em>: There are a few Absurdly High Stakes Games throughout the series, but the most obvious example would be when the hero wagers that he can guess which card his opponent is holding. If he wins, he will receive crucial information, but if he loses, he will have a swarm of deadly bees released on him.
</li><li> At the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SummerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SummerWars">Summer Wars</a></em>, a game of Hanafuda is played with avatars as currency.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. Weirdly enough, in the manga, Atem has a policy of not playing the Duel Monsters card game with an ante because he doesn't want bet his precious cards on a wager, but he is perfectly fine to bet his and Yugi's life to compensate the lack of Star Chips... only to instead inflict penalty games on evildoers, where if they cheat they suffer psychosis or death.
<ul><li> Later, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Duel Monsters</a></em> series has no qualms about not only introducing an ante rule for both rare cards, Star Chips, and Locator Cards for tournament progression, but the villain plans often include wagers of souls. The most bizarre stakes often belong to minor antagonists, though. Especially during the arc where an entire city has its streets taken over 24/7 by holographic card games:
<ul><li> If the protagonist loses, they're burned alive, or trapped in a cave forever - Pegasus' Eliminators Panik and the Brothers Paradox, respectively
</li><li> The loser gets their death by bleeding out from having their ankles severed by a buzzsaw (or sent to the Shadow Realm via Dark Energy Disk, in the dub) - Marik's Rare Hunter Arkana
</li><li> The loser is dropped through an exploding glass skydeck, through a busy shopping mall, to their death (or dropped into a portal to the Shadow Realm, in the dub) - Marik's Rare Hunters Lumis and Umbra
</li><li> The loser is drowned after being tied to a giant weight - Marik forcing Yugi and Joey to duel each other
</li><li> Losing any monster cards causes an important person to be wiped from the player's memory - Marik, vs. Mai
</li><li> The loser's body is forefeit to the winner's mental possession, while the loser is trapped in a digital world - The Big Five
</li><li> Losing any monster cards causes physical pain - Marik, vs. Joey
</li><li> The loser loses their soul to fuel a giant demon - DOMA and the Seal of Orichalcos
</li><li> Playing a counterfeit Egyptian God Card will cause a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Bolt of Divine Retribution</a></em> to descend from the sky, knocking the victim and possible bystanders into a coma

Whether he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> by the villain or not when he made the bet is unclear, but he certainly was after he lost. Even worse, Saiou's ante was the Destiny Hero cards, which <em>he didn't even have</em>, meaning it was a wager he couldn't have kept.

<ul><li> When Yuusuke's gang broke into Tarukane's mansion to save Yukina, Tarukane invited his friends from the Black Black Club to place bets on the outcome of the eventual fights. When Yusuke and Kuwabara were about to fight the Toguro brothers, Sakyo waged so much on the heroes' victory Tarukane had to risk practically everything he owned in order to accept the bet. Too bad for him the Toguro brothers were actually working for Sakyo. When Team Toguro and Team Urameshi later became the finalists of a tournament, Sakyo and Koenma waged their lives in the fight that decided the tournament. It was not the first time Sakyo bets his life but became the first time he lost. Also, during other stages of the tournament, some other people wagered their wealth and lost.
</li><li> The word game Kurama plays against Kaito is bet with souls.
</li><li> The video games against Game Master can count as well. If they don't win quickly, they'll be too late to seal the tunnel to demon world. They don't die or lose as long as they don't quit. By becoming the heroes of the video game brought to life, Yusuke's group can play the game again if they lose but will die if they let it go to game over. Also, Game Master took the place of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, meaning that if he loses he'll die, as stated by the video game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Kurama made him realize this to unnerve him and win the game faster</a>.

To distract a pirate crew that boarded Moya (as well as alleviate his own boredom) in one episode, Rygel played a low-stakes game of Tadek with the crew's captain. When Rygel accidentally revealed Moya had recently hosted a fugitive the pirate's were hunting, the game suddenly turned extremely high-stakes with Rygel forced to wager the location of the man (and their shipmates) in exchange for his life. The pirate captain won, but it turns out that the entire thing was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> and that Rygel intentionally threw the game (which itself was quite a challenge because his opponent was a <em>horrible</em> player) once he realized that unless the pirates thought they would leave with something of particular value, they would have simply killed everyone aboard when they departed regardless of an earlier promise to leave them in peace. For good measure, Rygel had pilot change their Comms frequencies the moment the pirates boarded, and the frequency he gave to pay his wager was a fake, leading the pirates on a wild goose chase far from their actual target.
<ul><li> Rygel is less than successful on other occasions, however, having been defeated when gambling for food in a later episode. In the novel <em>House of Cards</em> he also loses Moya to a local despot entirely.

Rather than surrender to the Romans, the Jewish rebels arranged themselves in a circle and killed every seventh man (#6 killed #7 since suicide is a sin) until only Josephus remained. Although not technically a "game", the situation and his ingenious solution has been studied by mathematical game theorists for centuries. Josephus himself claimed that it was God who made him survive, but since it was Josephus who came up with this plan in the first place after Plan A (surrendering to the Romans) failed, more cynical historians and mathematicians have assumed that he figured out which person to start counting at.
