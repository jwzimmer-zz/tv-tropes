This trope is easier to observe rather than analyze.
</p><p>This trope <em>arguably</em> makes the most sense when considering time travel from a scientific point of view, see the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">Novikov self-consistency principle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xtml');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xtml" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xtml');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Novikov's self-consistency principle was named "the Law of Conservation of History" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> in his short piece "The Theory and Practice of Time Travel," published at least ten years prior to Novikov's work. Of course, Larry Niven is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> writer, which may explain why nobody cares. Alternatively, this is an illustration of something called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy">Stigler's Law of Eponymy: nothing ever gets named after the first person to discover it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span> However, the number of time-travel plots that it allows for are extremely limited and the logic gets complicated <em>very</em> quickly. This, however, also has the side-effect of creating a '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">self-correcting universe</a>' usually by a slew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidences</a> (e.g. if you try to shoot your grandfather the gun will jam; if you try poisoning him he will recover; if you try strangling him you will be overcome; if you wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a> from the future you will have second thoughts; if you try sending a bomb back through time and detonating it directly inside his chest the time machine will break down). This can also lead to a scenario where the <em>only</em> reason why the past is not changed is because someone else says 'you cannot' and you take his advice. Meaning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">the advice itself</a></em> is a part of the universe's self-correcting nature.

This makes less sense, but it makes for a narrative convenience. If a You Already Changed The Past plot is used, the time travel will probably be a one-off thing, since repeating it would most likely get tedious.
</p><p>The Ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greeks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse</a> <em>loved</em> the notion that You Cannot Change The Future, and their works heavily imply that they believed in this specific notion of time (which even the Gods were trapped in). Although they used predictions rather than time travel, the effect is the same. Many first-time readers of the classics who don't buy into this notion of time, or don't realize this is <em>why</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> in the classics, have a hard time accepting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist">The Fatalist</a> behavior of classical Greek and European heroes.

She tries to keep a low profile, but events result in her obtaining the valuable Iron ore for the Empire, as well as gaining power. Yuri thinks that she's changing the past in ways that it shouldn't, but her being sent back is what resulted in the events of history as it's known in her original time.

<ul><li> In one, Lum goes into the future where she brings back Ataru's diary. He reads it and believes things will go right for him, but attempting to cause them makes everything go horribly wrong. It's later found that when writing the entry about everything that went wrong, his tears blur the ink, causing it to look like he wrote about things going well.
</li><li> In the other, the cast goes back in time to prevent Mendo from getting claustrophobia and nyctophobia. As a result, young Mendo pisses off the modern Mendo, causing him to attack his younger self. While hiding from his older self, young Mendo was trapped in a dark jar, causing him to grow deathly afraid of dark and tight spaces.

Details would be massive spoilers, but suffice to say that time travels differently in different universes, and something the heroes do midway through in a world that later turns out to be their own past sets up the very premise of the story, as revealed in the finale.
<ul><li> Also, one character who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> halfway through is fated to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> back, given that his future self, who actually reincarnates in the past is the protagonist's father. Yeah...see, all grammar is useless.</span> In fact, depending on which angle you see it from, the whole story wouldn't have happened if the past had not already included the influence of the future.
</li><li> However, the first instance of tinkering with time that we knew of was <em>not</em> an example of this - the group visits the world of Shara twice, before and after visiting Shura which turns out to be the past of Shara; and the effects of their actions are quite visible.

Haru made it very clear to the knight that the criminals he brought had invaded the castle ten days earlier, and that the knight was to take credit for catching them, which we see him talking about at the time Haru gave 50 years later. Getting Resha kidnapped enforced the king's decesion to have her fake her own death, leading her into the future where she get's amnesia and meets Haru, and ditching Sieg in the past leads to him being there to set the whole time loop up and make sure they mess with the past like they're supposed to.</span>

<ul><li> Doctor Doom's debut in Fantastic Four #5 has him send the heroes back in time to collect the treasure of Blackbeard the pirate for him. In order to do this, they don disguises and the Thing distinguishes himself so well at the swashbuckling that the pirate crew rally around him, electing him to captain the ship and give him a pirate nickname to match his appearance: Blackbeard!
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade">Blade</a></em> series had Doctor Doom lure the Daywalker to his castle, where Doom then proposed Blade with going back in time and saving his mother from a vampire attack. Blade asked him why he should do it, and Doom replies with "Because I've already seen you do it in the past." Doom is nice enough to give him a serum which would suppress his bloodthirst though.
</li><li> An issue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> series had an storyline where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loki sends himself back through time with the aid of Hela to accomplish certain tasks that had already been mentioned in a previous issue, but with certain details left unclear. Turns out that Loki was responsible for many of the major events in Asgardian history, but it's left unclear whether they still would have happened had he never gone back in time. Even he isn't completely sure. He lampshaded this trope, saying that he cannot change the past and make the future play out a different way, but he can make sure it will go the way it did.</span>
</li><li> In the "Dead-End Kids" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, the team is sent back in time to the 1900's to avert a catastrophic gang war. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only reason the gang war boiled over was <em>because</em> the Runaways went back in time; as it turns out, one of the gangs back then was under the control of Gertrude Yorkes's time-travelling parents, and when they discovered that their daughter was dead, they decided to fire up the gang war in hopes that the other Runaways would be killed.</span>
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em> volume 8, the title character is blasted into the 1800's, in spite of his long-held belief that time travel is impossible (due to the speed at which planets are constantly moving). He spends the first few years terrified of changing things and causing a paradox, but when pushed to act he settles on this trope.
<div class="indent">"Don't do <em>anything.</em> Except for what you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">were always will have done</a>. It's <em>not</em> a paradox if I was <em>already</em> part of the past."
</div></li><li> The time travel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a></em> is like this, specifically of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> variety - the war that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brainstorm</span> invents time travel to prevent turns out to have been DIRECTLY caused by time travel. On top of this, he was created <em>because</em> of the war, and had sold himself to the Decepticons to fund his project, which was why our heroes on the Lost Light believed he was going to kill Optimus and so followed him...
<ul><li> Then they threw in a few Stable Time Loops of their own - To go into all the ways the Crew mucked up the future by travelling back in time to fix it/stop it from being changed would take up the best part of this page
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brainstorm</span> tries again to stop the war by going further back, but the Crew follow him to stop him again (still thinking he's after Optimus in some way), and they all just create more time loops that keep any loops in the future on track. When they all return, nothing in the past has changed and time is as much on track as ever. Except there's now a parallel universe, of course.
</li><li> The most notable example is how Time Travel is the cause of the legend of the Sparkeater - because Whirl took a gun from Brainstorm's lab that turns people into Sparkeaters, which was only created because Brainstorm met a Sparkeater early on in the comic (which had been made by his gun millions of years ago, no less).

When they fail to kill him, the present Wildcats and Spawn agree to go with them into the future to defeat the Ipsissimus, but it turns out this was part of a predestination paradox, as the Ipsissimus uses the opportunity to give Spawn the medallion that corrupted him and caused him to turn evil to begin with. When back to the present, the influence stats, and Spawn starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a>... until the future Wildcats realize their mistake and make a last attempt to modify a minor action in the past.

</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">Terminator</a></em> film follows this exact method (the second movie and on go for different rules of time travel). It also gives a rare example of the good guys directly benefiting from the immutability of time. The machines sent back a Terminator to kill Sarah Connor before her son John Connor was born, in response, the rebels send back... the guy who becomes John's father. Also, in a deleted scene, it turns out that Cyberdyne, the company that built SkyNet and the original Terminators, acquired the remains of the Terminator. The sequel shows that they'd begun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">reverse engineering the Terminator</a>, which would presumably have led to the creation of the Terminators had the events of the sequel not occurred, so it happened on both sides.

Although this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">contradicts how time travel is usually portrayed in the series</a>, it does fall into line with the one episode of the original series that also used the "slingshot around the Sun to visit 20th century Earth" method.
</li><li> This gets covered regarding the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyAccidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyAccidents">Happy Accidents</a></em> very well <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mjyoung.net/time/happy.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deja_Vu_Timeline.png">diagram showing at least four runs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of the timeline are needed to explain how the events of the movie are possible, perhaps several trips of smaller changes adds up to one big enough change.</span>
</li><li> An interesting case is the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck">Paycheck</a></em>. What happens to the protagonist (he is administered a procedure which would erase all of his memories from the coming two years; when he is finished, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">told these two years already happened</a>) would be a perfect example of this trope. Only there's no time travel (though the plot revolves around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotChangeTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotChangeTheFuture">future-seeing machine</a>).

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, where Marty goes back in time and introduces 1985 concepts to 1955, but the movie implies that he only changes the source of the original idea without actually altering their progression into the modern day. He didn't invent skateboards but he introduced skateboarding to Hill Valley earlier than would have caught on naturally, and he didn't write Johnny B. Goode, but hearing his guitar solo inspired Chuck Berry over the phone. Since these things don't actually <em>change</em> the future, it looks like they were always that way. His comment also inspires the busboy Goldie Wilson to go into politics, although Wilson is still mayor in the original timeline, meaning he would have found inspiration elsewhere.

Thinking that Godzilla was simply a living, but otherwise ordinary dinosaur until a hydrogen bomb test in the 1950s mutated him into a monster, the Futurians go back to the 1940s and move the dinosaur far away from the test, then head to 1992 to see if Godzilla has ceased to exist. It turns out all they did was cause history to play out the same way it already had: the spot they moved the dinosaur to is contaminated by radiation from a wrecked nuclear sub some time around 1979, mutating the dinosaur into Godzilla and causing him to attack Japan in 1984 right on schedule. The Futurians never seem to realize that they were trying to undo events that they themselves caused.

<ul><li> It is established fairly early in the story that it is impossible to change anything that the hero knows about what will happen. Every attempt he makes to save his father (who died in WW-II) is prevented in some way.

<ul><li> In <em>Dragonflight</em>, F'nor returns from the past to warn his friends that an expedition they're planning is going to fail. Unfortunately they now know that if they <em>don't</em> go it'll create a paradox because the guy who warned them won't come back in time to warn them... so his warning has exactly the opposite effect. Knowing they're going to fail they have to set out anyway.
</li><li> And of course we have the situation where there are too few riders in the present due to many of them having suddenly disappeared in the past. So someone travels into the past to gather some more, thus causing the shortage. (Although it's not as futile as it sounds because their numbers would have declined anyway due to a coming period of long inactivity. This way their disappearance is useful.)
<ul><li> This is without even mentioning events from a more recent novel in which a Gold somehow randomly jumps to a few centuries in the past after being given a BAD mixture of gene-altering medicines in an effort to cure a plague running through the dragons themselves, which results in said Gold crash-landing in a time when one of the last trained geneticists is still alive, thereby resulting in the creation of aforementioned medicines when they would not have otherwise been made, but had already been made anyway because in the past the sick dragon had already crashed....good god my head hurts.

</li><li> This was true in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeTravelersWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeTravelersWife">The Time Traveler's Wife</a></em> by Audrey Niffenegger. The main character was constantly going into both the past and future, but everything was pre-set. Everything he did when he went into the past, he had "already done", and once something happened, he could never change it; in situations where he already knew what was going to happen, he had to act in the way he had already acted, he didn't have any choice.

In the second book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a></em>, while stranded on prehistoric Earth with an exodus' worth of incompetent aliens who are plainly going to begin colonizing, Ford Prefect tells Arthur Dent "This doesn't change the past, this is the past."
<ul><li> Then again, Ford and Arthur's presence in the past is almost completely negligible. For example, they simply show up in the alien ship. It was already supposed to crash on Earth and they had nothing to do with that.

<ul><li> The short story "The Red Queen's Race" has a character who tries to <em>make</em> this trope happen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was asked to translate several modern books on physics into ancient Greek, with the work being beamed back into humanity's past.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity">The End of Eternity</a></em>. Despite changing history themselves all the time, the Eternals are certain that the existence of their organization is guaranteed by this trope—how can they eliminate their own existence? The exception, an Eternal who is certain that time loops are intrinsically unstable, turns out to be correct, and Eternity eliminates itself.

The private eye's secretary is surprised when her boss curtly turns down this chance to get drunk on someone else's money. The private eye explains that he's already taken the assignment three times, and each time the time travelers sent him back to this point in the time line, with a massive hangover from drinking too much German beer. There's no way he's getting another hangover piled on top of the previous three, not for any amount of money!
</li><li> <em>The Skull</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a>. An assassin is sent back in time to kill the founder of a subversive religion before he gives a famous speech, only to realize that the Founder is himself — the 'miracle' that inspired the religion's creation was him appearing after he'd been killed (he'd arrived at the wrong point in time) thus 'coming back from the dead'. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> supposedly given by the Founder never actually happened, but was a result of history being embellished after his death.
</li><li> Happens quite a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CountAndCountess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CountAndCountess">Count and Countess</a></em>, in which the two eponymous characters exchange letters with each other despite living more than a hundred years apart. Notably, Elizabeth, living in the 1500s, knows that her ancestor Matyas Hunyadi (in the 1400s) held the throne of Hungary for a very long time. In an attempt to save Vlad Dracula's life, she warns him not to try to make a grab for the throne, or he will probably be killed. As a result, Vlad stays as far away from Hunyadi as possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Which gives Hunyadi plenty of time to rouse the Black Forces against Vlad and stop him in his tracks.</span>
</li><li> Happens at the very end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfTheImmortalNicholasFlamel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretsOfTheImmortalNicholasFlamel">The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</a></em> books.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem">Stanisław Lem</a> pumped this to the max by time travellers creating the whole world from the physical constants up. What started as an attempt to make things better for everyone ended with our reality because of bureaucracy, competition, attempts of personal gain, human mistakes etc.
</li><li> This is how most of the wizards decide time travel works in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em> ("In fact, history <em>depends</em> on you treading on the ants you've already trodden on.") There's no real evidence they're right, but it's simpler than Stibbons attempting to explain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">Butterfly of Doom</a>. It does seem to apply in Fourecks, where Scrappy tells Rincewind that things he's <em>going</em> to do will affect the past, but in Fourecks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> is in full effect.
</li><li> This is how Time Travel might work in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Magic20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Magic20">Magic 2.0</a></em>, at least, as far as they know. Nothing seems to change the future, past a certain point. For instance, time travelers who went to live out Arabian Nights caused medieval England to have glass windows, but the future is unchanged. Shown in more detail in the second book, where two of the same person are there at the same time, and the older one insists on this trope. Then again, since all of reality is a complex computer program, "time travel" is being played out in accordance with the program's logic. Time travelers are specifically forbidden from going to their own future, implying it doesn't exist yet, even though they know people who have come from a later date. Some theorize that traveling to the past results in the program merely creating a separate version of reality (i.e. a separate virtual world), in which they can do whatever they want without affecting their original "world".
<ul><li> Interestingly, in the case of the same person existing in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> with herself, all the predictions of her older self turn out to be spot-on, and any even where it seems things will work out differently are actually orchestrated by her to make it seem this way.
</li><li> Good luck convincing Phillip of that, though. He rejects any idea that his fate is not his to control, which is what first endears him to Brit the Younger (who has been forced to live alongside her older self Brit the Elder for decades, constantly being looked down upon as an immature child). Phillip posits that Brit the Elder is merely a construct of the program, created to maintain the illusion of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> and that she's not really the future version of Brit the Younger.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan">Greg Egan</a> plays with this trope every which way from Sunday (<em>except</em> straight) in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orthogonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orthogonal">Orthogonal</a></em> trilogy — mostly just because everybody accepts that it would be impossible to change the past, so nobody tries.

After the explosion, they find what looks like writing etched into a newly-exposed part of the rock, which seems to be a message from the ancestors (the inhabitants of the homeworld). Because of the planet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinSickness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinSickness">Merlin Sickness</a>, the message must have been carved at some point in the future. The obvious assumption is that the message means the journey is successful; the <em>Peerless</em> makes it home, and at some point the ancestors visit Esilio and carve the message as encouragement to the travelers. But Ramiro decides that he wants to have a hand in fate, so he plans to go out and "carve" the message himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tarquinia prevents him from doing so — and he then realizes that <em>she</em> is going to carve the message. He spends most of the rest of the book under the impression that she did — only to discover after the climax that she tried to carve it, but no matter what she tried, the message stayed there, which means that she didn't do it either. The book ends with an implication that one of the characters who returns to the homeworld in the epilogue is the one to go to Esilio and carve the message.</span>

Meanwhile, they're also trying to get back to their own time period, which will apparently require a nuclear explosion, and so they steal a nuke from the Nesk. This causes the Nesk to leave the planet angrily, but not before diverting the path of a comet that was originally going to narrowly miss the Earth so that it crashes into it instead. Most of the Animorphs want to use the nuke to destroy the comet and save the Mercora, but Tobias has Ax sabotage the nuke in a way so that the Mercora won't realize it's a dud until it's too late, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous-Paleogene_extinction_event">having realized that the evolution of mammalian life as they now it depends on that comet striking.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

The events leading up to that appearance are explained in the two-parter "War Without End," in which we find out that Babylon 4 was taken to the year 1260 AD (or so) to help the Minbari and their allies gather to fight the Shadows. To prevent this from happening, the Shadows sent a big bomb to Babylon 4 just as it was about to come on line in 2254. However, the White Star also goes back in time (because Delenn, Sinclair, Sheridan, and Ivanova see it in a recording), destroys the bomb, and (as it turns out) takes it back in time as well. However, this is not before the time device (sent by Draal and transported by Zathras) malfunctions, dropping Babylon 4 into 2258, leading to the events of "Babylon Squared." Sinclair then realizes (having received a message from Valen before the journey) that he must take Babylon 4 back in time himself, and then uses the triluminary device to turn himself into a Minbari—specifically, Valen, who led them in the First Shadow War, organized their society, and effectively became the main prophet of their religion.</span> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> is fully completed, so to speak, by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Valen dies, he eventually gets reincarnated as Sinclair.</span>

The Minbari <em>think</em> he is Valen reincarnated when they encounter him at the Battle of the Line because he has Valen's soul; not knowing about the time travel, they don't see that Sinclair will <em>become</em> Valen in the future before travelling back to the past.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em>: This is a recurring theme in the time travel episodes of the Nicholas Prentice arc.
<ul><li> In the episode "Tribunal", history professor and Holocaust scholar Aaron Zgierski is taken back to Auschwitz by time-traveler Nicholas Prentice (who turns out to be Zgierski's own great-grandson). While there, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape">rescue Aaron's "older" sister</a> (who is only eight at the time) by bringing her into the future to live out her life free of Nazi oppression. History recorded Aaron's sister as dying at Auschwitz after being "dragged away" by a couple of guards, who were actually Zgierski and Prentice in disguise.
</li><li> In "Gettysburg", Prentice wants to <em>change</em> the past by convincing a Civil War buff (who has pro-Confederate views) of the wrongness of his convictions by taking him and his friend to just before the Battle of Gettysburg. Originally, the buff was going to assassinate a black President in his own future. Instead, the buff takes this opportunity to try to alter the course of the battle in the Confederate favor. He accidentally uses Prentice's time machine (shaped as an old-fashioned camera) to transport a Confederate general through time. His attempts at preventing the (from his viewpoint) catastrophe result in him getting shot for cowardice. Prentice takes the friend back to his time, and the latter finds an old newspaper with the picture of his dead friend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture">Meanwhile, in the Future</a> the transported Confederate general appears at the moment of the original assassination, and he ends up being the presidential assassin (he was actually aiming for a man dressed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, who was standing next to the president).
</li><li> "Time To Time" subverts this when a new recruit into the temporal agency goes back in time and prevents her father's death due to eco-terrorists' bomb going off prematurely. This results in another member of the agency suddenly vanishing. His colleagues figured out that, without her father to tamper with the bomb, it went off as planned and killed a lot of innocent people, including an ancestor of the temporal agent who disappeared. Reluctantly, the girl has to let her father sacrifice himself. However, she does alter her mother's fate somewhat by giving her a coping mechanism (in her timeline, her mother's a wreck; in the altered one, she is an accomplished artist).
</li><li> Another episode (not part of the arc) involves a scientist building a time machine and traveling several days into the future, where he sees his wife bleeding out from a gunshot wound in their living room. Distraught, he goes back and does his best to prevent this from happening. Not only does he sound crazy to everyone around him (including his wife), but his time travel has also unhinged him, slowly driving him crazy for real, until he accidentally shoots his wife with the gun he got to <em>save</em> her from being shot. The episode then promptly subverts this by having him go back to the day he first met his wife and killing his younger self before the event, himself vanishing due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox">Grandfather Paradox</a>. Then we're shown his future wife, who appears to be depressed and preparing to commit suicide (it's implied that meeting him would have helped get through the depression).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> was somewhat inconsistent on this trope. It's the trope namer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, but Sam and Al always remember how things used-to-be even as Sam changes the past (Al keeps track of the current timeline's history using his handheld computer-link to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>). In episodes that directly impacted Al or Sam, they would have the entire memory of both things happening.
<ul><li> Sam <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> successfully</span> tries to save his brother's life in Vietnam, which alters history and results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Al still becoming a prisoner of war. Al allowed him to save his brother by not telling him he was one of the prisoners</span>.
</li><li> The series finale had a somewhat omniscient bartender asking Sam if there was anything that he wanted to do differently. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sam remembers when Al was invisibly dancing with his first wife, Beth, who became heartbroken when she thought Al was killed in Vietnam and married someone else by the time Al was released. Sam then travels to that moment and tells Beth that Al is alive and coming home - the next leap only shows a black screen, with epilogue text stating that Al and Beth had celebrated their 39th anniversary and Sam was never seen again.</span> Supposedly, this is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, since the creators did not expect the show to be over at this point. When the news came about the show's cancellation, they hastily added a blank screen (so hastily they misspelled Sam's last name) as a half-assed attempt to wrap up the show.
</li><li> In one episode, Congress is reviewing Project Quantum Leap's funding and leans on Al (acting as the project's representative) to have Sam alter history in ways beneficial to the US. Al tries to get Sam to prevent the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident">U-2 spy plane incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but Sam is in the past protecting a young attorney. At the end of the episode, the Congressman in charge of the committee is about to cut the project's funding when, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture">in the past</a>, Sam unintentionally corrects the attorney on a key piece of Constitutional law which she had wrong and she says could have made her fail the bar. Cut to the present, where the obstructionist Congressman is replaced by an older version of the attorney, who approves the project's funding for another year. It's never made explicit, but Al's surprise at the sudden change suggests that he's aware of the change.
</li><li> However, in the episode about the Kennedy assassination, while Sam can't prevent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">himself</span> from killing JFK, it then appears the reason he was sent back there was to prevent Jackie Kennedy from being killed, which most viewers would have assumed had already happened, whether Sam had anything to do with it or not.

<ul><li> Though it seems SG-1 held to the "Alternate timelines/universes" first. The 20th episode of Season 1 had the "Quantum Mirror" which put Daniel Jackson in an alternate timeline/universe. "1969" was the 21st episode of Season 2.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum">Stargate Continuum</a></em> shows the present universe being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedRippleEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayedRippleEffect">erased</a> by Baal's actions in the past. As a part of the SG-1 team consciously try to outrun the phenomenon, the stargate wormhole somehow shields them from it. So, while there are alternate realities in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>, those may be unrelated to time travel.

<ul><li> This actually ended up being shockingly accurate to the viewer's timeline. The episode tells us they're visiting the year 1968, and Spock indicates that on the day in question, there will be an important assassination and that the US will launch an orbital weapons platform (the latter of which becomes the basis of the episode's plot). On March 4th, 1968, six days after the episode aired, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated, and the US launched Apollo 6, which crashed...the same fate as the unnamed platform at the center of the episode

He then finds himself back in time to the night of Abraham Lincoln's assassination. He desperately tries to warn everyone that Lincoln will be assassinated, but he's brushed off as drunk and a man named Wellington (who late turns out to be John Wilkes Booth) takes him in. While in his care Wellington drugs him and goes to assassinate Lincoln. When the engineer wakes up, the president is shot mere moments later and he discovers the man who drugged him was in fact John Wilkes Booth. When he goes back to his original timeline, he discovers he did actually change one thing. The police officer who believed him and tried to save the president got promoted to chief of police then a councilman and later became a millionaire allowing his descendant (who in the original timeline was an attendant at club the engineer was a part of) to inherit his fortune.
<ul><li> Played straight in "No Time Like The Past" where after a scientist fails several times to change history, he decides to go back to a time where there were no issues, 1888. Upon realizing there will be a fire at the school so he tries to stop it, but when a horse and buggy swerves to avoid hitting him, it launches a lantern which hits the school causing the aforementioned fire.

Kennedy volunteers to go back to set things right but the historian instead sends Kennedy to the future and takes Kennedy's place in the motorcade, being assassinated in his place. A colleague of the historian then tells the Secret Service agent who helped him that "Even the act of traveling in time is part of history" and that the historian's sacrifice was part of the "correct" timeline.

She agrees to take a one-way trip to the past to kill Hitler as a baby (it's not clear why the future people think that the new reality will be better). She pretends to be a new maid and ingrains herself into the Hitler family, realizing that Hitler Sr. is the one who taught his son to hate the "lesser races". In the end, she grabs the baby and jumps into the river (also unexplained why she had to jump herself, possibly guilt for killing an as-yet-innocent baby, though it was mentioned in the beginning it was a one way trip so it's not like she could get back to her original timeline). The other maid, takes a homeless gypsy's baby and passes it off as young Adolf. So yeah, if this is believed, Hitler was one of the "lesser races" he hated so much.

<ul><li> There <em>are</em> some indications Germanic mythology played with this, however, in that while one couldn't alter their own fate, because the fates of all beings are intertwined with one another, everyone <em>else's</em> actions can affect another's fate.
</li></ul></li><li> The concept of Predestination. This concept is prevalent in all Calvinist churches (Reformed, Presbyterian, Baptist, congregational, Pentecostal), and in nutshell means that the life and final depository of a human being is preordained and predetermined by God and he or she can do nothing to avoid it. In other words, people are selected either to Heaven or Hell before they even were born.
<ul><li> This same concept is prevalent in Islam. The only way to avert the predestination is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">get killed in Holy War</a>, which earns you an automatic admission to Paradise. However, most Muslims believe that Allah only <em>sees</em> what people will do ahead of time, but doesn't cause it (whether or not that really allows for free will can be debated of course).

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series uses this as an important plot point; more than one character has goals achievable only by finding ways to subvert this. Interestingly, while two entire games in the series take place in the past, <em>while this trope is in effect,</em> it still manages to have one of the most complicated sets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> ever. One of the protagonists <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>is himself</em> a walking subversion, and thus finds himself endlessly manipulated by pretty much everyone, because he's the only one who can alter time in their favor.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Kain:</strong> "Suppose you flip a coin enough times. Suppose one day...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it lands on its edge.</span>"
</div><ul><li> Interestingly the first game in the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain">Blood Omen</a></em>, used a different kind of time travel - the kind where you go back, do something, and return to the present to find the effects of your actions having taken place. This was played straight with no mention of the paradox that would ensue from this kind of time travel. Two games later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKainSoulReaver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKainSoulReaver2">Soul Reaver 2</a></em>, when time travel was reintroduced as a much more significant plot element, the rules were established <em>around</em> this instance of time travel, and it turns out Kain's original trip back to the past, as depicted in the first game without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">RetCons</a>, already met the criteria for how someone can achieve a true alteration to the time line.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> ending has this trope, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimecia giving her sorceress powers to Edea in the past and Squall suggesting the SeeD idea at the same moment, setting up the organization that Squall is raised by.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect">TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</a></em> is an example of this situation. Sergeant Cortez does, at least once per time period, meet a future version of himself that saves him, then when he reaches the period the future version is from, he then goes back to save his past self, fulfilling the time loop. EX: in the stage "What Lies Below", Cortez is saved by himself from the future, then has to defend his future self from zombies while the future self kills ghosts. Shortly afterward he wants to follow his future self, but his future self tells him "but where would you be if I hadn't shown up?". Future and Past Cortez part, then Past Cortez finds the ghost gun that Future Cortez found, steps into a wormhole, and ends back up where he was before, becoming Future Cortez. Now Future Cortez (who is controlled by the player) must kill ghosts while past Cortez shoots the zombies. When past Cortez asks to stay in a team, future Cortez tells him exactly what he heard from himself at this point. "Where would you be if I hadn't shown up?". The two part, and Cortez continues.
<ul><li> This does create an odd situation however in the "Scotland the Brave" stage, where Cortez finds a locked door, and his future self gives him a key, telling him to pass it on when he's done. When he reaches this point, he finds his past self, and he gives him the key, and tells him to pass it on when he's done, then leaves. The question remains however: where did the key come from in the first place if Cortez was passing it between time periods but never stopped to find it?
</li><li> This is explained in the final boss fight, which actually also reveals this trope was being subverted the whole time. Halfway through the fight Cortez realizes that he's outgunned and decides to go back in time and aid his past self to defeat the boss. This would be fine except that "future Cortez" never showed up to help you defeat the boss in the first place. Anya's talking of "creating a time loop" suggests that every prior instance of "looping" was caused by an alternate Cortez <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">doing something significantly different</a> (like say, deciding to make his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Alternate Self</a>'s job easier by passing a key he found.) and only now is the player-controlled Cortez getting to be the "Starter", which also conveniently means the Player doesn't have to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> twice ("Past" Cortez isn't seen after the battle, because he presumably went back to help <em>his</em> past self battle Crow).
<ul><li> The game actually features two completely different forms of time travel, and it is implied that use of the first tore the universe a new one enabling the second.

He defeats the Empress of Time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> only to discover that she <em>is</em> the sands in corporeal form, and that the events that led him here were of his own making.</span> The second half of the game is about the Prince deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and subvert this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, the evil Orochi was defeated by a legendary hero named Nagi and a miraculous white wolf, who died in the attempt. The wolf was actually Amaterasu in physical guise, and was resurrected a century later as you, the player character. But then you travel back in time and discover — you were the one who defeated Orochi then too, and the wolf who died was a different version of you.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a></em> seems to avert this; when the past is changed, it sends a measurable 'ripple effect' back up the time stream, which can be detected and is used to alert time agents to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>. However, it's theorized that there are some changes to the timeline that are actually <em>supposed</em> to happen, which don't produce these ripples and thus can't be detected and averted.

<ul><li> "Eyes of the Idol" has an emissary from the Council of Mages tell the Flying Squirrel that the Nazis have attempted to travel back in time to the middle ages and conquer the past. However, a known issue with time travel is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> and most people who travel back or forward in time quickly die because they have no immunity to the sicknesses of the age and vice versa. This can be accounted for and avoided, but the Nazis never learned how. As a result, the Nazis who went back all died and, in the process, caused the Black Plague; their attempt to establish the Thousand-Year Reich a thousand years ago was always a part of the timeline.
</li><li> In "The Honoured Dead", the Red Panda and Flying Squirrel are supposed to recover an artifact that disappeared ten years ago. They decide to go back in time and steal it, on the assumption that this was how it went missing in the first place. While there, they stop a man from committing a rather explosive suicide. Only after the fact does the Red Panda realize the man they saved is someone they know in the present day.
</li><li> In "The Chimes at Midnight", a pair of would-be assassins come to 1945 Toronto from the future to murder the man who would become the Black Eagle on the day he becomes a superhero. They <em>think</em> that's because it's the day he gets his powers, but all they actually do is confirm that the Black Eagle becomes a name for the history books; much to the Red Panda's and Flying Squirrel's chagrin, since the Black Eagle is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry Kelly, an agent of theirs they've known since he was a little boy who, thanks to this event, knows to lie about his origin story to ensure it happens</span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played mostly straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Roswell That Ends Well", where Fry and his crewmates end up in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, where his grandfather Enos was stationed in the military, and he spends half the episode just trying to make sure his grandfather is not harmed. After the Professor warns him not to change the past <em>unless</em> he was already destined to change the past, Fry's extreme caution (and stupidity) result in his grandfather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">being vaporized by an atomic bomb</a>. Although Fry previously recognized both of his grandparents from childhood, subsequent events and episodes nonetheless make it clear that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">man Fry killed was not actually</a> Fry's biological grandfather, and that his real grandfather is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fry himself</span>.
<ul><li> Later episodes of the show reference this example as played straight, with "The Why of Fry" confirming that Fry was born with a genetic strength/defect (lacking a certain kind of brain wave) due to the events referenced, However, it may be mildly zigzagged as a previous episode seemed to imply Fry's father knew his father, and/or that Fry knew his grandparents, and he seems to recognise them in "Roswell That Ends Well". It could be partly explained by the infuriated Professor giving up all attempts at subtlety and launching a full-blown assault on Area 51 with the Planet Express ship to retrieve the parts necessary to get home...
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Professor</strong>: Choke on that, causality!
</div><ul><li> Also, Zoidberg is the Roswell alien, and Bender's body was the (alleged) remains of his spaceship.
</li><li> The movie "Bender's Big Score" tinkers with this a lot, for example Bender was responsible for the destruction of New York seen in the first episode, the real-life election of George W. Bush as President, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for the previously unexplained fossilization of Fry's dog, Seymour, from "Jurassic Bark"</span>. This gets especially weird when Bender travels back in time and turns out to be responsible for giving the secret of time travel to himself.

<ul><li> Goliath tried to convince Demona in the past not to turn evil, and she seems to take it all to heart. Unfortunately, one guy, even the love of your life, telling you to "stay good" is trumped by centuries of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">brutalized by humans</a>. It's a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> to realize that Demona and Goliath were once really and truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>.
<ul><li> During the same incident, Demona also tried to warn her younger self of the destruction of her clan in order to turn her against the humans. Demona is in massive denial, however; she herself was one of the major causes of that very destruction, in one of her anti-human plots.
</li></ul></li><li> Xanatos uses this to his advantage. He gives two period coins to the Illuminati, along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteBackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteBackToTheFuture">with a letter</a>. The coins are like pennies in the past, but by the present they're very valuable and are the coins that started his fortune. The letter, of course, is to tell him to do just that.
</li><li> Later, Goliath attempts to use the time-traveling Phoenix Gate to save Griff from being killed during the Blitz in WWII London, after being accused of abandoning or murdering Griff by his companions. With incident after increasingly improbable incident occurring that indicates the universe has decided Griff is its new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a>, Goliath ultimately concludes that fate will not allow Griff to get home and uses the Phoenix Gate to bring Griff back with him to the present, thus causing his original disappearance.

</li><li> Goliath winds up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, and various characters suggest using the Phoenix Gate to fix it; Goliath repeatedly points out it doesn't work that way. In the end he is finally willing to try it, only to discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this whole thing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo">Puck</a> as a ploy to get Goliath to hand the Gate over</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Used on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>. Brainiac 5 imports heroes from the past because history mentioned an incident where heroes traveled to the future. He tries to avoid mentioning how it turned out, of course, just to be sure things go the way they're supposed to, with only two of the three returning. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nobody dies.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> episode "Paraducks", Gosalyn warns Darkwing not to interfere into the past when they went back in time to his childhood. At first he doesn't and returns to the present, only to find that S.H.U.S.H. doesn't exist, the King, a two bit thug from Darkwing's childhood has taken over St. Canard and he serves as the King's cowardly lackey, never became Darkwing Duck. They go back and time and shut down the King for good and give little Drakey Mallard (Darkwing) the courage he needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> special "The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker": Timmy and 21st-century Cosmo were the ones responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making Crocker lose his fairy godparents <em>and</em> giving him the opportunity to partially get around the ensuing mass mindwipe thus causing his obsession with fairies</span>, which also indirectly led to his own birth due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the disappointed scientists at Crocker's presentation in the '80s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">investing in Dinkleburg's parachute pants</a> and causing him to break up with Timmy's mom, thereby getting his parents together.</span>
<ul><li> Of course, in the original timeline, 1970s-era Cosmo would have exposed himself and Wanda as fairies due to his own stupidity. In addition, the original timeline Crocker did not have a functional scanner nor build one. Here, Crocker stole the one Timmy got from AJ before putting Cosmo's hair and having an effective fairy detecter, though not any more success.
</li><li> This is also "confirmed" by being tied to a real-life history example, as Jorgen warns Timmy he is not allowed to interfere with March 1972 ever again after the episode's events, but suggests he is free to interfere with the rest of the year as much as he wants, as long as it does not hurt "President McGovern". In real life, Sen. George McGovern lost that year's presidential election in one of the most notorious landslides in election history, suggesting this is Timmy's doing as well.
</li><li> Later episodes zigzag this example, by featuring a completely different version of Crocker's fairy godfamily, his childhood behavior, and how he loses them, as the show increasingly adopted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">negative continuity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> episode "Bad, Bad Rubber Piggy" had Zim send a rubber piggy into Dib's past at crucial points to kill him, only he survives by an inch each time (though every time he comes close to death, he's given robotic body parts from his father due to losing his own) and after his tampering with the past results in an angry Dib in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> bent on killing him, he sends his last piggy to the past to warn him not to send any piggies to the past in the first place. This returns the timeline to its original state, but because the piggies replace objects in the past, the plan only worked because the piggy replaced Zim's <em>brain</em> (he got better).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> Mojo Jojo goes to the past to kill the adolescent Professor Utonium before he can create the Girls. The Girls pursue him. It turns out that in the past Professor was a lazy ass and a bully with no interest in becoming a scientist and creating the Girls, if it weren't for Mojo's interference and the consequent encounter with and rescue by the Girls that gave him inspiration.
<ul><li> Mojo should be glad for this, considering that the Chemical X accident which created the Girls also gave Mojo his super intelligence. If he succeeded in his plan, then he'd just be a regular monkey. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox">But then he wouldn't be able to go back and kill the Professor, therefore the Professor would survive to create the Girls and make Mojo super intelligent, therefore Mojo would go back and try to kill the Professor</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> In the season 2 episode "It's About Time" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Twilight Sparkle is visited by her future self (from a week later, looking entirely worn) and told "whatever you do, don't..." with the sentence being cut off. Past Twilight then spends the whole week worrying about and trying to prevent whatever happens during the next week, with each incident causing her to gain the looks of Future Twilight, indicating she hasn't changed the future at all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She only then learns later that nothing actually happens. So she goes back into the past to tell her past self "Whatever you do, don't... worry about the future" only to end up being pulled back into the future right where it cut off for Past Twilight, setting the events into motion for the whole episode.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>. After discovering that they're all on prehistoric Earth, Dinobot's mind becomes consumed with the question of whether he actually has free will, or whether this trope is in effect and all of his actions in the past are predetermined. His question is answered when he spies on Megatron and sees him experimenting with altering the future by blasting a mountain and checking an image of the future version of the mountain. When the image changes before their eyes to show the chunk missing, Dinobot realizes that the future can indeed be changed. Ironically, the knowledge that he is indeed free to make his own choices causes him to feel like he has no choice but to invoke the trope <em>anyway</em>, because Megatron wants to change the future for the <em>worse</em> and he's the only one close enough to stop him before it's too late, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">even if it costs him his own life</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dinobot:</strong> The question that once haunted my being has been answered: the future is not fixed, and my choices are my own. And yet... how ironic, for I now find that I have no choice at all! <em>[transforms to robot mode]</em> I am a warrior... Let the battle be joined....
</div><ul><li> Played with again in the finale. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dinobot II, being influenced by the original Dinobot's spirit</span> sends the Maximals information concerning an Autobot shuttle docked in the Ark. Blackarachnia points out that the historical records never mentioned that the Autobots had a shuttle. Rhinox then exclaims that history is still being made, and uses the shuttle to save the day and take everyone home, which explains why the Autobots supposedly never had it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha">¡Mucha Lucha!</a></em>: in <em>Woulda Coulda Hasbeena</em>, Señor Hasbeena uses a time portal to go back to 1972 and prevent a flash of light that briefly blinded him and killed his career as a professional luchador. Ricochet, Buena Girl, and Flea try to stop him because his time travel is altering the present and, in the ensuing fight, present-day Señor Hasbeena uses a signature move that creates the very flash of light that ruined him in the past.
</li><li> Invoked and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>. Starfire ends up 20 years in the future, and the time-traveling criminal responsible for this explains this trope. Then she gets back to her time and finds that something <em>has</em> changed.
