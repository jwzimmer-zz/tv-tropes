<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em>: Pandora's Guardian, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">giant, armored, demonic, fire-breathing zombie minotaur</a>, fights Kratos in a narrow corridor with some sort of ballista mechanism at one end of it; Kratos can use the ballista bolts to chip away at its armor, and eventually defeats it by impaling it on the door at the other end of the room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">God of War II</a></em>
<ul><li> Perseus' preferred tactic is to use his helm of invisibility, then either sneak attack Kratos with his sword or take potshots with his sling. Unfortunately for him, he is forced to fight Kratos in a room with a shallow pool of water, meaning you can use the ripples and splashes to help figure out where he is.
</li><li> Clotho fights in an arena filled with deactivated traps that aren't at all suited for hurting someone the size of a normal human. Kratos, of course, uses them to kill her in an elaborate puzzle boss battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII">God of War III</a></em>: Heracles is wearing armor made from the pelt of the Nemean Lion, whose golden fur is nearly impregnable. Heracles by extension would also be invincible, were it not for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">his tendency to stop</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">bellow loudly</a>, and drop his guard with a bum rush long enough for Kratos to counter it and slam him into one of the walls of spikes set up around the arena that keeps him in place long enough for Kratos to remove his armor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em> has at least 3 such bosses. The first one is a Cyclops blocking your way. You are at a high cliff and the guy reaches from below, grabs the ledge with one hand and uses the other to smash you if you try to bypass him (why he doesn't try to climb up the cliff is anyone's guess). All attacks against him are useless. The solution? Keep slashing the hand grabbing the ledge and he'll fall off the cliff. Idiotic indeed. The second one is an invincible (to swords and chakram) fire breathing giant dragon that can only be killed by dropping stalactites on it. Admittedly, said stalactites are not unique to this level, you do get to make use of them to bypass obstacles in LATER levels, but still... The final boss is also invincible and constantly charging at you, and the only solution is to lure it to charge at the supporting columns. When enough columns are smashed, the ceiling will collapse and kill the boss while you hide under an uncollapsed section (if you have enough sense to rush there, that is.)
</li><li> The fourth boss in <em>Super Bomberman</em> can only be damaged by being shoved into an electric fence with your bomb blasts.
</li><li> In <em>Superman: Shadow of Apokolis</em>, Superman has to defeat Livewire at Stryker's prison. Like the TV series, Livewire is made of living electricity and is vulnerable to water, which there's plenty of in the arena.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Action/Adventure </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has plenty of examples.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>: Ganon is virtually invisible <em>and</em> invincible in the dark, but then there are torches in the room that Link can light up and expose Ganon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Seasons</em>: The Dodongo fight is like the original, but you need to use the Power Bracelet to throw him into the spikes after he swallows the bomb. Why are there spikes there? There's also the random giant metal spike ball in the area of the fifth boss, Digdogger. Good thing you got those Magnetic Gloves beforehand, and no, the spike ball doesn't reappear later. Both Agahnim and the Poe Sisters would have fared better if they didn't fight in areas with torches.
</li><li> <em>Ages</em>: Smog averts this by making you play a 'game', changing the arena to try to get his separate parts together. The game, being more puzzle-oriented than Seasons, avoids this.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> 3D</em> (but not the original game), Odolwa's only weak spot is on the back of his head, and arrows are too unreliable to really finish the battle. Lucky for you that there are Deku Flowers scattered around the floor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">and that he just stands around and patiently waits for you to drop a Deku Nut on his head and stun him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>:
<ul><li> Armogohma fights you in an arena filled with giant, hammer-wielding statues, which are the only way to kill it and the only such devices in the game.
</li><li> Stallord fights you in a circular room that conveniently has grooves spiraling up it, allowing Link to ride up using his Spinner and attack.
</li><li> Argorok fights you on a rooftop with towers in each corner that Link can use to Clawshot his way up to where Argorok flies around.
</li></ul></li><li> Fraaz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em> takes a rather different approach; upon noticing that Link has been using the two torches in his chamber to damage him, he simply reaches over and smashes them apart. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">he starts using attacks that can be used as replacements for the torches to damage him</a>, making it only a little harder than before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gohma is invulnerable to grapple and sword attacks, because she is shielded by a thick layer of armour. Handily, the boss fight takes place in a cavern with a weak ceiling and a dragon's tail poking through it. Putting a little bit of weight on the tail causes part of the roof to crash down, destroying her armour. This is at least somewhat justified by the story, since Gohma is living in that exact spot in order to harass the dragon you can drop on her, making it more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>.
</li><li> Fighting the boss Jalhalla involves hitting him with light from holes in the ceiling and throwing him into spiked pillars around the room.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Being a game composed entirely of boss battles, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> naturally employs this trope.
<ul><li> A memorable example is the eighth Colossus (Kuromori, the lizard), who you fight in a ruined Colosseum. He has incredibly powerful lightning attacks, and there is no way to damage him at first. If he stood still, he would be invincible. But, if you aggravate him and hide, you can get him to climb the walls to try to hunt you, at which point you can shoot him to make him fall down, leaving him vulnerable.
</li><li> Both of the "dogs", smaller and faster Colossi that chase you around, are beaten this way. The first is said to be afraid of fire (the only one that is) and lives in an abandoned temple... that has torches around (the only place that has them, mind) so you can scare him with them to push him off a ledge and destroy the armour. The second chases you around as you bait it into knocking over pillars to you can hop onto a ledge, which it crashes into. The final pillars cause the ceiling to collapse onto it, destroying that armour as well. Had they traded locations at least the first one would have been impossible.
</li><li> Also memorable is the 16th Colossus, Malus. His lightning attack is even more powerful and has strong knockback. Although he holds the high ground in his arena, the arena is also filled with defensive walls and tunnels you can hide in, to approach his blind spot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Draygon's lair is surrounded by turrets that fire balls of plasma at intruders. A few missiles render them inoperable, however, leaving behind bare high-voltage circuitry that can be used to electrocute Draygon in four seconds flat. The boss can also be defeated the old-fashioned way with loads of missiles, but frying it is easier and considerably faster.
</li><li> Crocomire would be completely invincible were it not for the conveniently placed acid pit behind him.
</li></ul></li><li> Flaahgra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> has the misfortune of having grown at the center of a mechanism that happens to expose its weak points. When it's stunned, Samus can enter one of the tunnels of the mechanism as a Morph Ball to hurt the boss with a bomb.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in the Mr. Freeze fight: Freeze didn't design his hijacked lair (an old GCPD forensics unit), but once you've used the environment to land a stealth attack on him, he promptly alters it via his suit's mechanisms so you can't use that trick again. You need to find about seven (ten in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>) different methods of weakening him.
</li><li> However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clayface's</span> boss fight resembles this. One of his attacks is to roll into Batman: if done right, you can have him roll into the explosives set in the corners of the room and severely weaken him.
</li></ul></li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico">ICO</a></em> saw fit to decorate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her throne room</span> with movable, mystical stone pillars that nullify <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her instant-petrification spell</span>. All it takes is for Ico to drag them around the room and hide behind them at regular intervals until he can get close enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">take the sword she's vulnerable to and stab her with it</span>.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> bosses.
<ul><li> <em>Blood Omen 2</em>:
<ul><li> Faustus stands atop furnaces in a room full of mist, which you can use to become invisible and sneak up close enough to turn the furnaces on and burn him.
</li><li> The third boss, Sebastian, isn't so much Boss Arena Idiocy as it is he's plain stupid — he crawls along the walls and leaps at you, and there's a laser in the center of the room. If you stand on the other side of the beam, Sebastian will leap <em>into</em> it to try and hit you, and hurt himself in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Soul Reaver</em>:
<ul><li> Melchiah's chamber has retractable portcullises you have to lure him through and impale him with, and he's finished off after being pinned beneath a giant meat grinder installed in the ceiling.
</li><li> Zephon's chamber contains the corpse of a vampire hunter equipped with a flame thrower, allowing you to ignite the eggs he lays and throw them back at him to burn him.
</li><li> Rahab is even more vulnerable to sunlight than most of his vampire brothers, and makes his lair in a chamber full of boarded up windows which Raziel can shatter with telekinetic blasts to incinerate him.
</li><li> Dumah has spent so long in the spectral realm gathering strength that he is completely invulnerable to all of your attacks and would be unstoppable... if he didn't chase you into the blast furnace, or the one room in the fortress with something in it that can kill him. Weirdly, despite immolation being the only thing that can kill him, he's still completely immune to the fire and sunlight glyphs.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Defiance</em>, Turel's chamber has four gongs that ring loudly and stun him when rung.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first boss, Tiamat, would be unbeatable if her arena wasn't surrounded with torches and bomb flowers. The second boss, the Griever, is defeated with a freight rail carrier that War can punch into her gut. Straga's own weapon and the floor of his own arena are both used to kill him.
</li><li> In the Griever's case, it's not technically her fault — she has no idea you can move something that big. Tiamat can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">allegedly</a> be defeated using only your Crossblade without the bombs.

<ul><li> The Last Elephant-bot enemy fought in the <em>Freakshow</em> can't be damaged by Dan's normal weapons, but the cranes can be used to crush it by dropping spare parts on it.
</li><li> The Count suffers from both this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>; the first stage of the fight requires you to use mirrors to reflect his spells back at him, and the second has you aligning them so that they reflect sunlight onto him, causing him to burn.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> has several bosses like this.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">Spider Queen</a> is completely immune to your attacks, her only weakness being her eyes inside her abdomen. But all around the arena are conveniently placed flowers that are here for no reason at all and that you can use to grab her hooks and open the Queen's abdomen, exposing her weak point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">Ninetails</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Lechku &amp; Nechku</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Yami</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom">Boss Rooms</a> are also full of lava, water, and thunder without which you wouldn't be able to do a thing to them.
</li></ul></li><li> The boss of the theater level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em> is slightly smarter than most in that he destroys the spotlights once you've used them to stun him. He's still not smart enough for basic pattern recognition, and ignores the other identical spotlights who are all within spitting distance of each other. Even after you successfully used the first two on him, he doesn't think to destroy the third.
</li><li> A number of bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a></em> movie crossover games suffer from this, too; and at least one of which, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Rancor</a>, is also such in the movie where it came from. At least in the movie, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as being put there by its owner, Jabba the Hutt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII">Dungeon Siege II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first act-boss battle is against a three-headed hydra out in a large courtyard. The Hydra heads' breath is quite deadly. However, it just so happens that there was a convenient piece of thick wall right in front of the Hydra's position, which your characters can hide behind while recharging their powers.
</li><li> The first part of the battle against the dragon in The Northern Reaches has the dragon alternating between aerial attacks and long range attacks from various perches around the rampart you're standing on. There also happens to be a large ballista that can be turned toward said perches which is the only way to damage the dragon at this stage. Partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as the tower was set up for defense, not as the dragon's lair.
</li><li> A straighter example is the fight with Valdis at the top of Zaramoth's Horns. Near the four corners of the room are "Eyes of Zaramoth", small statues with wings and a single eye that will fire a very powerful beam shortly after being struck. Naturally, this is the only way to hurt Valdis at this stage. The fight concludes with a giant version being gradually uncovered that Valdis must be positioned in front of.

<ul><li> Like his <em>World of Warcraft</em> counterpart below, Razuvious wields a runeblade that will kill you in 3 (2 on Heroic) hits. Thankfully, you start with a Mind Control Crystal that steals two Understudies from him to soak the damage until you can stabilize.
</li><li> Lady Deathwhisper has 30 Health and 90 Armor. However, you start with a 30/5 Dragon that can't attack or be attacked while damaged, giving you a serious powerhouse so long as you keep her healed up. This is somewhat justified since Deathwhisper was experimenting on the dragon when the fight begins, but is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by the Lich King as to why she didn't bring any cards to finish the dragon off.
</li><li> Boommaster Flark's gimmick involves you keeping minions between two live wires so they don't connect and damage your hero. The boss lampshades why he gave <em>you</em> the wires, since his whole plan is to use them to activate a bomb and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>, and the player actually has a chance to stop him now.
<ul><li> Occasionally fights will look like this on Normal... only for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Heroic</a> version to be "do it again, <em>without</em> the Arena Idiocy".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></em> features Onaga, who is stunned when you destroy (touch) one of six objects called kamidogu, which are the source of his power. Naturally, he places them along the fringes of the arena, spaced 60 degrees from each other.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    First-Person Shooter </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em> has at least two of these. The first chapter boss is completely immune to all damage apart from two adjustable columns that can shoot lightning between them. The final boss is impervious to everything except a floaty teleporty doohickey. Neither of these unique architectural features can be found anywhere else in the game.
</li><li> Two bosses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying">Clive Barker's Undying</a></em> have this:
<ul><li> Aaron wields a chain that he uses as a whip against you. The only way to defeat him is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to position yourself in front of one of the rings on the wall and dodge his attack. His chain will get trapped in the ring, and you can attack him while he's busy trying to get the chain out</span>.
</li><li> Ambrose is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> invulnerable because he grabs your magic Gel'ziabar stone and puts it in his axe. He's only killable when a giant Gel'ziabar dog comes out of nowhere and attacks him, and then you can only kill him by first shooting the stone out of his axe. If you don't rush up and kill him right away, the dog will vanish, and he will pick up the stone, put it back in his axe, and resume being invulnerable until the next dog attack</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nihilanth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> is invincible by drawing upon the power of (and expending) energy orbs floating around its head, which get replenished by easily destroyable crystals on the walls of its chamber. Once the crystals are gone, the orbs eventually run out and the Nihilanth is toast.
</li><li> You reach the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> with no offensive weapons at all, only a Gravity Gun, so the game provides a dispenser of plasma balls to fling at the boss.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII">Doom II</a></em> is a giant invulnerable face in the wall of an arena which spawns endless monsters from the hole in its forehead; its only weak spot. You can shoot rockets into the hole to kill it, but such a task would be impossible if not for the arena providing a convenient elevator that reaches the height of the brain hole.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaPrime">Alpha Prime</a></em> follows the "boss recharging from arena items" example - specifically, when damaged enough it retreats to a mined area through which some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> glows and replenishes its health. Emphasis on "mined": the laser drills used to do that are still in place, and when activated will kill the boss in one hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NosferatuTheWrathOfMalachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NosferatuTheWrathOfMalachi">Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi</a></em>:
<ul><li> The way to beat the Foul Beast Vampire is to run into the tunnels. It will then run after you and park itself in front of the entrance you ran into, allowing you to run out another one and hit it with a Stake from behind.
</li><li> Isn't it convenient that the creature that can only be killed by the Sun at dawn is performing a ritual that must be done at dawn? And isn't even more convenient that he doesn't try to avoid the rays of sunlight?
</li></ul></li><li> In the final boss battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediOutcast">Jedi Outcast</a></em> it is possible to kill Desaan without once hitting him, by collapsing multiple pillars onto him. It is also possible to overcome him by main force and skill, but using the environment is much easier.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Hack And Slash </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>, the battle with Nightmare. He first appears as a completely invulnerable pool of black goo which swallows Dante up if he touches it. Hitting the switches that surround the arena enough causes him to take on a more solid form which, while more dangerous, is also vulnerable after it attacks.
<ul><li> Apparently, those were installed to control Nightmare and make it do what the makers wanted. Considering how powerful Nightmare was, it's understandable. Possibly, they actually PREFER Nightmare in "Battle" Mode as the alternative doesn't really...do anything.
</li></ul></li><li> Lyran, a Lich in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance">Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance</a> 2</em>. The first time you meet him, he's completely invincible, and you're forced to fight your way through his castle while keeping your distance from him and dodging his spells. Eventually, you find the ossuary where his one weakness (his mortal remains from when he was alive) is stored, and he decides to lock you in the one room where he's vulnerable so he can do battle with you properly... Needless to say, it goes poorly for him.
</li><li> The scarecrow boss in the Plague Town level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a>: Seven Sorrows</em> seems to have left a number of giant pots of flaming oil sitting around so you can tip them over on him.
<ul><li> And the final Sorrow, Caldera, saw fit to decorate his arena with several huge ballistas pointed right at himself.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Mecha Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a> 3</em>, the higher ranked Arena opponents either frequently use their Overboost or take to the skies and will keep boosting upward even when they hit the ceiling which usually gave you two easy ways to kill them. One was in the desert arena where you could trick the OB-saavy opponents to dash right out of bounds which counts as an automatic forfeit. Or you could go to the parking lot where their movement will be limited to a few feet in the air so you can pound them to death with the strongest weapons and they'll just float there and take it all.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    MMORPG </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> It would be nearly impossible to defeat Anub'arak in the Crusader's Coliseum save for the conveniently placed frost orbs floating around his lair which, when knocked down, form icy patches on the floor that prevent his minions from burrowing and stun him when he runs into them.
</li><li> Karsh Steelbender in Blackrock Caverns is almost invulnerable to player damage unless he's lured into the molten metal conveniently pouring down out of his forge. Of course, doing this also causes him to inflict massive fire damage to the entire party.
</li><li> In Naxxramas Instructor Razuvious hits hard enough to make him nigh-untankable. However, his nearby students can be mind-controlled by priests and sent to soak up his hits. It's even worse in the 10-man version, where for no particular reason (save for the fact that a 10-man raid may not have people who can mind control) there are <em>mind-control orbs</em> sitting right there that anyone can use. That's just asking for trouble.
</li><li> Professor Putricide in Icecrown Citadel would kill the entire party with pools of ever-growing slime if he did not conveniently have a bottle on his desk that transforms the person who drinks it into a mutant monster that eats this slime.
</li><li> The Ulduar Flame Leviathan and indeed the entire section leading up to it would be impossible if a bunch of siege engines hadn't been left right by the entrance. The Flame Leviathan would also be much harder if there weren't barrels of pyrite floating all over that can be shot down and it tricked into running over or shot at it by the vehicles.
</li><li> Brann and the other allies who show up built the siege engines from salvaged Titan technology.
</li><li> The blind dragon Atramedes of Blackwing Descent makes the mistake of fighting your group in a room where the walls are lined with shields that can be smacked like gongs to deafen and disorient him. It goes without saying that this is the only way to beat him.
</li><li> Also from Blackwing Descent, Chimaeron is a boss that deals massive amounts of damage for his level -Massive enough that the fight would be impossible if not for the Bile-O-Tron, a device that prevents Chimaeron's attacks from killing anyone who has more than 10,000 health. This case is partially justified in that the Bile-O-Tron was built by a gnome Nefarian was keeping prisoner and was not supposed to be there, but then, one has to wonder how Finkle managed to build it while caged in the first place (or sneak it in when he was captured, if he'd done so already).
</li><li> Magtheridon has five cubes that must be used to banish him when he uses Blast Nova. Justified in that Illidan's forces were keeping him prisoner there.
</li><li> Razorgore the Untamed has a mind control device in his room, which you need to use to make him destroy the eggs before you can defeat him.
</li><li> Bloodlord Mandokir is able to instantly kill any player with almost all of his attacks. Good thing he chooses to fight you in an arena surrounded by benevolent spirits who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">can resurrect you and make you stronger</a>.
</li><li> Morchok from Dragon Soul is another example. He summons huge earthen spikes right before casting Black Blood of the Earth. The spikes themselves don't serve any purpose except for the players to hide behind to completely avoid damage from Black Blood of the Earth, which, if stood in, will kill you after a fairly short amount of time. Basically, he'd easily wipe the group if he didn't also summon those spikes for no apparent reason. In a similar vein, the final boss of Sethekk Halls charges up a massive Arcane Explosion that does fatal damage, but is easily blocked by hiding behind one of the several pillars he has in his room.
</li><li> The Spine of Deathwing fight takes place with the entire raid riding on Deathwing's back. At various points in the fight, he will attempt to shake the players off by rolling. This is potentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> on the entire raid, but it can be avoided by using the numerous tentacles sprouting from Deathwing to secure yourself to his back. Though Deathwing didn't put the tentacles there intentionally (the sheer amount of power he's absorbed is causing his body to mutate and collapse) one has to wonder why he does not simply slam his back into the ocean he's flying over and crush/drown the players.
</li><li> Goroth creates massive spikes around his arena. Players use them as shield against his more powerful attacks.
</li><li> The Desolate Host has mechanics that impact both the physical and spirit world. If it weren't for a set of braziers that allow players to freely shift between realms, the spirit enemies would be safe from attack.
</li><li> The Antoran High Command has three bosses who rotate in and out of pods capable of spewing high damage attacks. Not only would they be safe from attack if they stayed in the pods and just rained hell down on the players from there, but they also leave the pod open. The special abilities granted to players by the pods are the only reason the fight is possible on higher difficulties.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights">Spiral Knights</a></em>: The Snarbolax is invincible unless the Beast Bell in his boss room is rung when he's close enough for it to stun him. The Roarmulus Twins are immune to Knights' weapons, but not their own missiles; the Twins are placed directly across from each other with switchable walls between them.
</li><li> The Undead Lich in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a> Prophecies</em> chooses to fight you in the one place where his immortality can be stolen. On a lesser note, he doesn't even bother stepping <em>away</em> from the nearby lava, sometimes even teleporting <em>into</em> the lava, causing him to burst into flames.
</li><li> Scarlet Briar's Hologram fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> is only possible in the first two phases due to it creating energy puddles that allow you to do full damage. In the third phase these disappear, but are replaced by small holograms that are much easier to kill, damaging the main hologram.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>: The All-Seeing Eye in Dzemael Darkhold is invincible unless it is floating above an area illuminated by purple crystals. Guess what you can find in the area where you fight it? Purple crystals. Made worse by the fact that the boss has to actually be in the purple illuminated area within the arena, so if it simply stayed outside these zones and used ranged attacks on players (it has several) then it would be fine. Either that, or it sends the adds that spawn throughout the fight into the area to deal with the players. There is no helping some bosses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDivision2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDivision2">The Division 2</a></em>: Boomer is a big armored guy that awaits you in a room fitted with shield generators that make nearby minions invincible. Fortunately, both Boomer and the generators are vulnerable to the mounted miniguns on the sides. He will wise up eventually and destroy them if the group takes too long, at least.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>: The boss battles are quite notorious for this.
<ul><li> Several fights against Bowser in platformers are winnable only because he challenges Mario in battlefields that have mechanisms working against him:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">The Lost Levels</a></em>, Bowser (and each of the fakes) stands on a bridge. On the other side of the bridge is an axe. If Mario can pass Bowser and get the axe, the bridge and Bowser fall and you win. And in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em> games, the fight is the same, but the axe is replaced by a large button with a skull on it. The tradition is continued in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand">Super Mario 3D Land</a></em>, once again with a button (only this time <em>it has his insignia on it</em>). The most that can be said for Bowser here is that in the DS game, once the player gets past him he will at least turn around and run for the button.

Unfortunately, Wario is on the other end of this in games 2 and 3 — most boss rooms make it easy for the boss to kick Wario out somehow.

Earthwake would be invincible if it didn't conveniently fight near the Dreamy Wakeport habour, leading to scenes like those in the battle with the Tower of Yikk from Bowser's Inside Story (aka you get to knock it in and smash the hell out of its head with a hammer). And Giant Bowser would be invincible at the end of his battle had the fight not took place in a lava filled wasteland that he could be easily knocked back into.

In Sonic's version of the battle, <em>Eggman himself</em> dispenses the robots, then complains when you're able to use the robots against Chaos.

In the case of Puftoss, there are electric pillars that can be activated by Lanky to harm the boss with a big electric charge. In the case of King Kut Out, as it's just a large cardboard, its related example is attributed to the stupidity of the Kremlings who built it, as they chose to assemble it in a tower protected by sevral wooden cannons which the Kongs can use to launch themselves to the boss when it's not attacking. Mad Jack can't help it either, as it's thrown from a Reject bin into a battlefield made of platforms that have buttons capable of electrifying them (which is what Tiny uses in-battle to hurt the boss).

However, the former was glitched so that Psychic-types resisted Ghost instead, and no powerful Bug-type moves existed. The Gen III remakes had Ghost work as intended, but the only Ghost-types in the region were also Posion-types, meaning that they were still weak to Psychic. Bug-types still had no powerful moves, and while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Dark-types</a> had existed since Gen II to give Psychics another weakness, no Kanto creatures were retroactively given the type.

</li><li> A couple of bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> are in arenas with areas they're too big to fit into. Fafnir can't fit behind the rocks and Yiazmat can't fit on the stairs of their respective arenas. Keeping your party in these areas will limit these bosses to only using ranged attacks (this is even more effective for Fafnir as its only ranged attacks can be reflected, making it possible to defeat it without even attacking).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em> has a partial example of sorts, mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>: Around the boss arena in the Moon level, there are barrels of an unspecified liquid lying around, which the boss (a minotaur) will attempt to drink. When he does, you can shoot them with Osmond, causing them to explode and damage the boss. However, the "idiocy" and "suicide" elements of this are downplayed by the fact that, should you fail to do so, the liquid has the same effect as a Stamina Drink, causing the boss to inflict double damage and take half damage.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a></em> the boss dwells in an area with a very obvious trap: There is a wall niche full of treasure with an absolutely enormous blood stain in front of it.

<ul><li> How about the Hind-D battle? He decides to blow up the whatever-they-are-tanks on the roof with his last missile... after his helicopter is already going down. Had he done that much sooner, he'd have taken out the only cover you had and you'd be at his mercy.

He's a guy who's covered in bees. The only place where you can't be hurt by his insect 'brothers' (though all worker bees are females without the reproductive capabilities of the queen) is in water. So where does The Pain, in his infinite wisdom, choose to ambush you?

<ul><li> From the same game, The Fear. There are two massive mistakes he made in choosing his ambush spot: first, it's the same place he tested his poisons, thus the rabbits there drop antidotes. Secondly, the place is littered with poison dart frogs. Given that The Fear will eat any food in the arena when his stamina drops, shooting a frog makes the fight even easier since they will poison him, dropping his stamina further.

Whenever you face them, they either can be sneaked past, or they are standing next to a moving platform that can be activated to send them to their doom. The Alpha bases also contain military robots that cannot be destroyed using conventional attacks; however, they can always be pushed into an electric barrier conveniently placed nearby, destroying both the robot and the barrier.

And when it possesses a giant suit of armour... the two carpets are perfectly placed to trip the giant knight up in one go.
<ul><li> The Big Boo in Treacherous Mansion has this too, in much the same way as Boolossus in the last game.

<ul><li> Chef Soulfflé has some melons in his kitchen that can be used to knock his frying pan out of his hands, though this is not the only way to make him vulnerable.
</li><li> Clems arena has spikes around his pool of water, and since he spends his fight dueling in an inflatable tube, Luigi can take advantage of him getting stunned and launch him into the spikes, sending him to the rim of the pool and knocking him out momentarily.
</li><li> Johnny Deepend would be untouchable since hes in a pool, but the pump for the pool is in the area, and thus the pump can be turned off to trap him in the drain.
</li><li> But perhaps the biggest ghost who made the mistake of choosing a poor arena is Ug. Ug possesses a T-Rex fossil to attack Luigi, but there are dinosaurs eggs that can be shot into the fossil to destroy it. To Ugs credit, he does catch wise and smashes one of them after taking the first hit, but theres another way to damage him that he doesnt expect.

</p><ul><li> In the original book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em>, the mop and bucket were part of a feint; the Witch had enslaved Dorothy (being unable to kill her or worse due to the North Witch's protection spell), and she was trying to get the Silver Slippers by having Dorothy trip while washing the floor. She just hadn't expected Dorothy to finally lose her temper.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkLordOfDerkholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkLordOfDerkholm">Dark Lord of Derkholm</a></em> where the Dark Lord stands by a bottomless pit full of magic fire and makes threats until the Pilgrims attack and knock him into it. It's all stage direction, though, the Dark Lord is an illusion who dies to set the final triumph on a tour.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">Exploited</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em> by Count Bela de Magpyr. His castle is designed to make him easy to defeat - he keeps stores of stakes, holy water, and lemons (along with instructions on how to use them), his decorations can be easily twisted into holy symbols, and he has large windows with easily removed curtains. None of these methods will permanently kill a Discworld vampire, merely reduce them to dust until blood splatters on them and they rise again. Ultimately, he and the townsfolk treat the whole experience as a ritual - every few decades, the Count rises and kidnaps a fair maiden. A young man from the town comes along to rescue her. The Count is 'killed', which gives him a few more decades of rest, and the young man is hailed as a hero. The book opens with his relatives who <em>don't</em> do this moving in to take over the region, and ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that extended family getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, because unlike Count Bela, they were a genuine threat to the community.</span>
</li><li> Grendel's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em> can't be harmed by any human-forged weapon, but has a giant-forged sword decorating her lair which Beowulf steals and uses to decapitate her.

Xylan, the villain, knowing that one of his enemy's most powerful weapons relies on her manipulating dirt, deliberately <a class="urllink" href="http://legendofmaxx.com/archives/1383">removes all dirt from his throne room and seals it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, making sure none can be brought in from outside. <a class="urllink" href="http://legendofmaxx.com/archives/1384">It doesn't work,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of course, but it was a good attempt.

</p><ul><li> Invoked in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> episode "Dungeons And Wagons". While playing an MMO, Jeff and Haley are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">trying to get an amulet that can resurrect Steve's character</a>, and must contend with a massive, nigh-invulnerable monster. Jeff notes that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">They always put in a way to win</a>," and spots... a scuba tank on a ledge in the room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">They throw the tank into the monster's mouth, and Haley shoots it with an arrow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">causing it to explode</a>. Worth noting that there is no conceivable reason for the tank to be there. It's an ancient ruin, nowhere near water, and the tank was high up the wall in a random alcove.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>, the Joker tries to kill Superman with a big hunk of kryptonite. He chooses to do this in a room filled with canisters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid">Hollywood Acid</a>, which Batman uses to dissolve the kryptonite.
</li><li> From the 1958 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KnightyKnightBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KnightyKnightBugs">Knighty Knight Bugs</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YosemiteSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YosemiteSam">Yosemite Sam</a> clearly didn't know that one of the towers in <em>his own castle</em> was full of explosives, and that he just brought his frequently-sneezing dragon in there...
