One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">The Oldest Ones in the Book</a>, named for the famous deceased in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRaven">The Raven</a>". In short, the three defining criteria are:
</p><ul><li> A love interest of a prominent character
</li><li> Is dead (or some equivalent of dead or occasionally just genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovMIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovMIA">believed to be dead</a>) before the story begins or dies relatively early in the story
</li><li> Their death has significant ongoing impact, consequences, and relevance for the remainder of the story
</li></ul><p>In determining whether a character who dies during a story can be classified as a Lost Lenore, the third criterion above is the most important: in order to fit this trope, the character must have just as much, if not more, importance to the narrative dead than they would alive. For example, Anna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em> is the hero's love interest and dies at the climax of the story, but she is not a Lost Lenore as all that happens after she dies is that Van Helsing is cured, lays her to rest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedHappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedHappilyEverAfter">sees her happy with her family</a> in the afterlife and roll credits. She does more for the story alive than she does dead.

However, in order to qualify for this trope, it must be clear that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">grieved strongly for her</a>, and that overcoming their grief and learning to love again is a significant part of character/plot development. Sometimes subsequent love interests never entirely replace Lenore. It can go all the way to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>.
</p><p>The Lost Lenore's mode of death can vary but popular choices include:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">Incurable Cough of Death</a> or other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease">related</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease">terminal illnesses</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">Stuffed into the Fridge</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li></ul><p>Lenores can also become lost through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystander Syndrome</a>, a tragic accident, or Random Act of God.
</p><p>If she left children behind, the children often have considerable emotional baggage to deal with, including a father (or father-figure equivalent) whose grief can render him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">overprotective</a>, neglectful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">absent</a>. The children may feel, or even be told explicitly, that they are either too much like the Lost Lenore, or else not enough like her. Angst ensues.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>If the Lost Lenore was murdered and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">Stuffed into the Fridge</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> usually ensues. Which leads to a crucial identifying point: many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie">Gwen Stacys</a> are also Lost Lenores, but not every Lost Lenore is also a Gwen Stacy, as someone explicitly blaming themself for the Gwen Stacy's death is an identifying criterion for this trope, whereas this is not always the case for a Lost Lenore.
</p><p>After her death, whether it occurs before the story begins or during its course, the Lost Lenore is present in the thoughts, dialogue, and actions of living characters. Her memory may motivate the living characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChainBeyondTheGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChainBeyondTheGrave">follow the example she set in life</a>, or she can be a dynamic presence within a story through the use of Flashback and/or direct interaction with living characters in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>. Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">forces of evil</a> may evoke the memory of the Lost Lenore, or even masquerade as a manifestation of her, in order to manipulate living characters.
</p><p>Sometimes living characters encounter another living character who for whatever reason strongly reminds them of the Lost Lenore. This new character could be a relative, reincarnation, or even just an uncanny doppelganger. In this instance, a romantic relationship may develop, but this is always based primarily on the character's resemblance to the Lost Lenore and, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a> can ensue. In some cases, the character may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">name a weapon or belonging after the Lost Lenore just to remember her</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">even develop a bond with them</a>.
</p><p>Occasionally, due usually to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">dramatic twist</a> Lenore turns out not to be dead after all, or dead for reasons by means other than previously believed. The Lost Lenore can sometimes be brought back to life through an act of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">by magic</a> but her death must be treated as a real event within the story. However, even if the audience knows or characters subsequently discover a twist in the tale, she must still satisfy the major criteria of having been loved and her perceived loss being of ongoing significance in order to qualify for this trope.
</p><p>Not to be confused with the comic book character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LenoreTheCuteLittleDeadGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LenoreTheCuteLittleDeadGirl">Lenore the Cute Little Dead Girl</a> who tends to cause death to other people rather than experiencing it herself.

Because the story starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a>, this technically happens before the story begins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue">during a flashback</a>, not to mention that even though Casca is not dead, she has been insane for most of the series and her insanity has played a bigger role in the course of the story than when she was sane (much to the chagrin of the fanbase), since A) her insanity caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Griffith violently raping her in front of Guts</span> drove Guts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">revenge</a> the most; B) the loss of love and affection that Casca provided Guts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass">constantly anguishes him</a>; and C) the entire drive of the story as of recently is Guts trying to find a cure for Casca's insanity, thus trying to make her "unlost."
</li><li> Saya, in the anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>, similar to the stuffed in the fridge example. You get tiny snapshots of her battle with Creed, but she is only found dead by Train. Train doesn't really recover till the finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he has a vision/encounter with an almost identical girl that seems to give him the realization that she wouldn't want him to grieve and obsess like he is currently</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Masaki Kurosaki, who is the entire reason we have a show. Everyone in her family (her husband, son, and daughters) all loved her, and treated her as "the center of [their] universe". Her death — and Ichigo's powerlessness to stop it — is exactly what prompts him to be the tough-as-nails badass we come to know him as. Masaki's death also had a profound effect on her husband Isshin, and her daughters Karin and Yuzu. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And this is before we learn that she was a <em>pure-blooded Quincy</em> whose death is connected to the death of Kanae Katagiri, another Lost Lenore.</span>
</li><li> Hisana Kuchiki, of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a> variety. Without her, much of this manga would never have unfolded the way it did as her death is the reason for the Byakuya/Rukia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">relationship</a> and all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother">consequences</a> that have come from that. In fact, BOTH of Byakuya's conflicting vows in the Soul Society Arc stem from his marriage to Hisana, because it was his defiance of custom (in marrying her and adopting Rukia) that led to his second vow (to never risk the family honor again) and the start of all his problems.

However, while being in grief, constant longing and waiting for his lost love, Habaek met and fell in love with Soah. Unfortunately, even though Habaek is already completely in love with his current bride, he still continues to long for Nakbin that when he reunited with her resurrected form, he reaffirmed his desire to be with her even if she was not the person to whom he was connected with the red string. After Nakbin's "second death", Habaek also promised not to love anyone the same way he loved her by telling Soah that his one eye will be used to look only at her, instead of looking at her with both which were used to look only at Nakbin. Though Soah had accepted the fact of being a replacement wife to Habaek, Nakbin's significance which was never denied by the god continue to bring troubles to the couple.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, Kirito is extremely haunted by the deaths of his former guild, the Black Cats of the Full Moon, but especially that of Sachi, the lone girl in the group, since the two were clearly attracted to one another and he had promised that he wouldn't let her die. The fact that he was unable to keep that promise still weighs heavily on him, and he still remembers her in dire moments, since she left him a message to assure him that he wouldn't blame him if she died and encouraging him to keep on living.

She suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a>, being deceased for five years before the events of the series. The promise he made to her is one of the two main reasons (the other being wanting his daughter to think he's 'cool') that Kotetsu doggedly continues with his job as a corporate-sponsored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> despite having to leave Kaede behind with her grandmother, keep his occupation a secret from her, and endure the manipulations of his money-hungry sponsors.

</li><li> Kasuka Mado, the deceased wife of Kureo Mado. Her death fuels his hatred of Ghouls and thirst for revenge, and after his death, it's shown that he still wears his wedding ring a decade after losing her.

His personality takes a pretty drastic change into a more serious one and he becomes considerably more knowledgeable and skilled in the area of magic/supernatural as he takes on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yuuko's</span> role. He also makes it a habit of going into moments of melancholy reminiscence for her.

Her death led to him leaving the Avengers, spiralling into a deep depression and living in the middle of nowhere, hunting animals to eat. He eventually returned to civilisation after an old mentor helped him to realise that Bobbi wouldn't have wanted him to live that way. Her death still lingered with him, though, and his ideal life in House of M involved being in a relationship with her.

She died of tuberculosis at the age of 24, and Poe never quite got over it. Any of his poems with a dead young woman — such as "Annabel Lee", "Ulalume", and "Lenore" — are believed to have been about Virginia.

Joe always takes the day off on the anniversary of the accident.
</li><li> King Henry VII of England felt this way toward his queen, Elizabeth of York. She died in 1503, and Henry went into seclusion following her death (on her 36th birthday, giving birth to a child who also died); for several days he would allow no one to come near him except his own mother. It's also worth noting that while their marriage was political, it was unusually happy, with no recorded instances of Henry even being suspected of adultery (unlike many kings of the era). After a time he did allow his courtiers to look for a new wife for him, but his description of what he wanted was almost identical to Elizabeth and, of course, no one could be found who came close. He died six years later, in 1509, having never remarried nor taken a mistress.
</li><li> Their son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>, also experienced this.

He also began hunting for wife number four only days afterwards. He only retroactively began treating Jane Seymour as a Lost Lenore years later when it became obvious none of his following wives would produce another son.

It was customary for the bereaved to seclude themselves for a few months, and for widows to wear black for two years. But Victoria wasn't even seen in public again for nearly two years afterward; she even watched the wedding of her son, the Prince of Wales, from a hidden alcove where people couldn't see her. She also wore black widow's weeds — black veil and all — for the rest of her life<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20snf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20snf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20snf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">except for her Diamond Jubilee, for which she wore a white gown</span>. She commissioned her iconic small diamond crown because she could wear a small crown over her mourning cap (unlike the full-size Imperial State Crown she would have otherwise had to wear to State Openings of Parliament) and because silver and diamonds, being white, were acceptable for mourning wear. For years after Albert's death, the household maids were instructed to lay out his clothes and personal effects as though he were going to get ready for the day. Even the contemporary British population — which had an unhealthy fascination with death — felt weirded out by her behavior; the high-water mark for British republicanism was in the 1860s, and the monarchy mostly held on through the efforts of the aforementioned Prince of Wales, the <em>bon vivant</em> Albert Edward, who did his best to keep up the positive image of the royal family and (gradually) get his mother to participate in public life.

Moore never got over her death, saying later in life that "there was no one else for me ... second best is no good for me ... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." Moore's hatred for Germans lasted his entire life; he never forgave them for her death.
