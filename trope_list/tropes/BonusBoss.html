</li><li> In the remake, Helmasaur King is a Mini-Boss in the Palace of the Four Sword. This one is more durable and it can regenerate its mask; what's more, it can summon Helmasaurs to impede Link, has to be hit with a Light Arrow before Link can strike it with his sword.
</li><li> Arrghus is another Mini-Boss from the Palace of the Four Sword. This one replaces the Arrgi with regular Bari (that instantly electrify themselves once they get hit with the Hookshot), and summons Kyamerons in its second phase.
</li><li> Mothula is the third Mini-Boss in the Palace of the Four Sword. This one is much faster, has a Doppleganger Spin, and can summon bees to attack.

He's not very hard, though, seeing as how proper use of Melio Scutum and any slashing Glyph would easily reduce his 6000+ HP down to nothing. Though this boss is interesting in the fact that when he dies, a seal is placed on his face, but if you break it off with an attack, he comes back to life, allowing you to fight him again as many times as you want.

In order to get to her, you had to beat the game as Sol or Ky, without using any continues — once you get to her, though, you can try to win as many times as you like, and if you do, you unlock her as a playable character. Considering the extreme difficulty of defeating Justice the first time, and the first game's broken instant-kill mechanics, this was quite a task beyond the calling of most casual players.
<ul><li> <em>Slash</em> and <em>Accent Core</em> also added in Order Sol, a past version of protagonist Sol Badguy, as one too. Fighting him in the latter requires having half of your victories (depending on the number of rounds set) be Overdrive/Instant Kill finishes before facing I-No; after which she will then teleport them to the past to fight him, which will no doubt end poorly considering how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">overpowered he is</a>. Fortunately, unlike Baiken above, Order Sol is available to use from the start so you don't have to subject yourself to such cruelty to get him.

Giga Bowser also appears as a bonus boss if you clear Adventure Mode quickly enough; and while he fights exactly like Bowser, aside from being bigger and stronger, you can't grab Giga Bowser to throw him off the stage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em>, extra doors appear in three stages after you beat Tabuu; going inside them will pit you against Toon Link, Wolf, or Jigglypuff, depending on the level. However, you only have one chance to defeat them and their AI is much more aggressive than the characters you fought previously.

If the player is on 5.1 or higher, they will be surprised when Master Hand and Crazy Hand blast apart, forming the various forms of Master Core. on 5.1, they will be attacked by Master Edges, at 6.0 they will get fought by Master Beast, then Master Edges. At 7.0, first Master Giant, then Beast, then Edges. No matter which difficulty, after beating the forms, you will then face Master Shadow, a duplicate of your current character. Finally, if you're on the Wii-U version and are playing at 8.0 or higher, you will then be attacked by Master Fortress, which is essentially a living stage requiring you to defeat four weakpoints while being accosted by various enemies. After all of that is done, Master Core will reveal itself, and if not defeated in under a minute, will instantly K.O. the player if they fail to dodge its attack. If the player defeats the orb or survives the attack (either by dodging or having more lives) then the battle is <em>finally</em> over.

Night Terror will replace Abyss if the player encounters and defeats Olcadan before arriving at the cathedral where the last few battles take place. Night Terror can also be fought in the 'Final Battle' mission of the game's challenge mode.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn">Virtual-ON</a></em> series has several of these, some exclusive to certain versions.
<ul><li> In the first game, if you win all your battles by Time Over, you'll get a Warning message and then enter a special battle with Jaguarandi, a mutated version of Raiden that varies each time you fight it. When you first fight it, it's about the size of a Raiden or a Belgdor, and its color is the opposite color of your mech. If you continue against it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss">it changes to a miniature toy-sized version that is colored purple, and its armor weakens severely (so much so that a close range attack from Apharmd will kill it instantly), and if you continue again, it can be killed in 3 hits by Temjin's Beam Rifle!</a> In the Japan-only PS2 version, if you beat all 8 virtuaroids in under 30 seconds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">you will hear a special chime and fight the original Fei-Yen instead of Z-Gradt</a>. This version of Fei-Yen is always in Hyper Mode, but its armor is not weakened and its attacks are more powerful than the regular Fei-Yen.
</li><li> The sequel, <em>Oratorio Tangram</em>, has Ajim — a crystalline, transparent virtuaroid. To fight him, you must win at least one battle in your run with a Time Over. Once this is done, he will appear randomly at any time, even as late as the Raiden fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">crashing down on your opponent and destroying them</a>. His stats are beyond mortal comprehension, meaning that he's faster and stronger than all other virtuaroids, and all damage done to it is lessened to roughly 5/8 of the usual. Oh, and you can't beat him via Time Over either — if you try and do this, you will lose automatically. Encountering him automatically unlocks him for regular play in the later revisions, but on the Dreamcast version 5.45, he was only playable by beating him, then beating the game, and holding both Turbo buttons on the Random select box on the latter half of each month. And when you play as him, he has the weakest armor in the game, and to make matters worse, his health drains by 2% every second.
</li><li> <em>FORCE</em>, the 3rd installment, has Shadow versions of your team that you can fight by, once again, getting Time Overs. These Shadow mechs are manifestations of a virus in the system, taking the forms of your mechs and making them much stronger than the normal version. Jaguarandi also returns, but as the default mid-boss, and this time it becomes <strong>LUDICROUSLY HUGE</strong>, taking up over half of the arena. It's also a mutated Guarayakha now instead of a Raiden, trading in most of its long range advantages for godlike close range combat tactics. Ajim also appears, with a female version of it called Guerlain, but as the final boss, and utilizing completely different moves than before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Galaxy Fight</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WakuWaku7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WakuWaku7">Waku Waku 7</a></em>, the two fighting games made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoGeo">Neo Geo</a>, shared a common bonus boss named "Bonus-Kun", a punching bag (from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">the Punching Bag Planet</a>") with a limited moveset who parodies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Ryu</a>. In <em>Galaxy Fight</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">after you defeat Felden</a>, you get to fight a final Bonus Boss in the form of Rouwe, an old man dressed in a karate gi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a> 2</em> had a very tough Bonus Boss in Kuroko, whom you could either fight by meeting certain conditions, or just randomly after stage 3.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneMustFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneMustFall">One Must Fall</a></em> has a few.
<ul><li> In the One Player story mode, there's Fire and Ice. To take on Fire, you need to be playing on at least the hardest non-hidden difficulty, beat your opponent on the Fire Pit arena, do a destruction on them, and enter a robot-specific code. If playing on the very hardest difficulty, beat Fire and do the destruction and code again and you can fight Ice. These two are extremely hard to beat, but the devs reward you generously for doing so. Normally, the end of round bonuses on the hardest difficulty are 400,000 points. For Fire, they're 2 million points, and for Ice they're 20 million points. Good luck getting a perfect round against Ice. The only way to not take any damage from him is to not take any hits <em>at all</em>, as he can still damage you even when blocking.
</li><li> In the tournament mode, there are various unranked challengers in each tournament. All of them are hard, and most require you to be playing on the hardest difficulty. If they're going to show up, they'll challenge you after doing a destruction on some other opponent. There's at least one occasion when one unranked challenger will challenge you after beating another unranked challenger, too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodStorm">BloodStorm</a></em> had several of these, all of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swaps</a> of your main characters. Unlocking most of them was both fun and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">ridiculously frustrating.</a> For example, one of them required you to knock down a stalactite in one stage using projectiles, so that it falls down a pit. Then, you have to jump down, land on the small platform, and then you'll be able to fight the boss. Another required you to drop your weapon, and then perform the "pick up" command so that you touch the center of a summoning circle. And so on.
</li><li> The final boss of the story mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> is Chaos, who is only level 50 or so and thus can be defeated easily with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>. However, beating him opens an extra campaign whose final boss is a level 110 Chaos called Ultimate Chaos.
<ul><li> Duodecim does the same thing, replacing the more-than-max-level Chaos with Chaos's new more-than-max-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>, Feral Chaos.

Beating him and the rest of Arcade Mode will unlock him and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">Moveset Clone</a> Alex, who is a dinosaur.
</li><li> In <em>Tekken 6</em>, there's Nancy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningLegendDaigoNoDaibouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningLegendDaigoNoDaibouken">Lightning Legend: Daigo no Daibouken</a></em> has two of them, Girigiri Oyaji (the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Mr. Exposition</a> and sponsor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> national fighting tournament) and K.O.J.

Once the main storyline is beaten, the player can fight an upgraded version of the final boss, the Invincible Sentinel. This gets bonus points for explicitly being non-canon; Tina and Brick wanted to hear about Athena fighting a raid boss, so they had her make one up. There is also a hidden bonus boss that the game doesn't tell you about, a giant rock monster named Iwajira (though once you know how to get to there, it is pretty easy to find).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> has some in its later updates. Versions 1.00-1.09 had the Cow King as a sort of Bonus Boss, though he was substantially weaker than the actual final bosses. Version 1.10 introduced Uber Diablo as a new Bonus Boss, and 1.11 introduced the Pandemonium Quest, which involves looking for keys and battling buffed-up "Uber" versions of bosses (Uber Izual, Uber Duriel, and an important lore character Lilith, who is an "Uber" version of boss Andariel). The result of the quest is players entering the Uber Tristram, where they must fight an epic battle against Uber Baal, Uber Mephisto, and Pandemonium Diablo, the super versions of the three prime evils, who attack all at once!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> has the Infernal Machine update, which introduces four unique bosses, the key keepers, in each act. After obtaining all the keys, the player could craft the Infernal Machine, which allows battling two super-versions of game's bosses at once, for great rewards. There are four such battles: Maghda and the Skeleton King, Ghom and Rakanoth, Zoltun Kulle and the Siege Breaker Assault Beast, and Uber Diablo who can clone himself and summon two of the other ubers. There is a special reward for winning all four battles and collecting special rare items from them.
</li><li> <em>Dungeon Siege</em> has two. One is easy to find, while the second is extremely hard. The first is Scorch, the ancient dragon of Rathe, whom the player could avoid simply by continuing by the road to Castle Ehb. Scorch is the biggest monster in the game, has the highest number of HP, and is nearly as deadly as the final boss. The second Bonus Boss is located in the hard-to-find secret "Chicken level", amongst the various chickens named after the game's developers. It is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colonel Norick, the boss version of the first NPC quest giver in the main game, an old man who dies in front of the player. He also is a spoof on Colonel Sanders of KFC fame</span>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">sequel</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OtogiMythOfDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OtogiMythOfDemons">Otogi: Myth of Demons</a></em>, the last bonus mission in the Forest of Havoc is a duel with The Crimson King, a recurring character from the first game. How hard is he? Let's list the ways. He hits like an angry truck, he can move just as fast as you, he throws magic fireballs that cause a bad status effect, and his ultimate attack hurts like hell... did I mention that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile">Homing Projectile</a>? If you had trouble beating the last boss of the game, then The Crimson King will wreck you without mercy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em> added several of these over the years:
<ul><li> Queen Atziri was the first Bonus Boss added to the game. To reach her domain, you need all four Vaal fragments, which are typically located in corrupted zones that appear occasionally, and not guaranteed. Defeating her nets one of her exclusive uniques and a chance to get a piece of an advanced Vaal fragment, which unlocked an even <em>harder</em> version of Atziri, who drops some of the best unique items in the game.
</li><li> Izaro lies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">the Labyrinth</a>. He hits hard and is always assisted by his Goddess who attacks independently from him. He's fought in three stages. The first two adds a gimmick that changes daily and need to be dealt with if you don't want it to carry over to the next phase and the last phase is in a room filled with traps. He's well worth the challenge if you want the power of those Ascendancy Classes. Also inside the Labyrinth is his pet Argus, who may as well be considered one due to how hard he hits.
</li><li> The Shaper is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of the post-game map content, and his domain is guarded by four of the toughest map bosses in the game. He is by far one of the strongest bosses in the game next to Uber Atziri. He also has his own set of exclusive unique item drops.
</li><li> Some bonus bosses are exclusive to the seasonal league content. Rigwald the Wolven King can be fought in the Talisman league with a hefty sacrifice of five tier 3 talismans (a weaker version of him exists as a map boss). The Pale Council can be fought in the Prophecy league by gathering all four fragments from the Council's prophecy chains. The Breachlords are available in the Breach league, which requires painstakingly gathering each of their splinters to form a key to their realm, which is made worse by the fact that you also need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">keep the breach open long enough</a> and not die to fight them in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimDawn">Grim Dawn</a></em> has the bosses of the four challenge dungeons, each found at the end of a long multi-level dungeon that must be cleared in one run without dying. There are also the Nemesis bosses, who only start spawning once you have maxed out your infamy with their respective faction. All of the above have exclusive Monster Infrequent items only they can drop.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    MMORPGs </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most MMORPGs have such things: Giant Monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, world/raid bosses in Everquest, and raid bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. Some are 'storyline' bosses, of course, but a lot of them are easily skippable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> features a few of them, most notably Urgoz, Kannaxi, Mallyx, Duncan the Black, and Dhuum. To make matters worse, all of them (save for perhaps Duncan) have a hard dungeon to finish in one sitting before you can face them; if you die, you have to do it all over again! The placement of Mallyx and Duncan make them candidates for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG</a></em> features the Landshark, which appears semi-randomly in Gold Beach. The Landshark is one of the only charge level 10 (max CL) monsters in the game, and features insane attack power, extremely high HP, and attacks that can take up almost the entire screen. If you see one, running is advised. An update nerfed the Landshark to more manageable levels. (It's now only CL 7). However, a gamut of new bonus bosses were added in its stead, as well as "Challenge" versions of all Instance Bosses. While none of these (with the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sea Witch and Labtech X</span>) are CL 10, they have the added difficulty of only being vulnerable to individuals below a certain charge level. Meaning that players wishing to battle Airshark need to suppress their CL to level <em>2</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> also has its share of bonus bosses.
<ul><li> The first one was Nightbane in Karazhan, where the only way to access him was to complete a certain quest chain. <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> also introduced bonus bosses in some of the regular dungeons that are only accessible on Heroic difficulty. However, the WotLK bonus bosses tend to be much easier than the the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of their respective dungeons.
</li><li> The Temple of Atal'Hakkar (aka Sunken Temple) has the first bonus boss in the game: The Avatar of Hakkar. You need to complete a quest chain to access him, too, and he's actually harder than the dungeon's final boss, Eranikus the Dreamer.
</li><li> The best example, however, is Algalon the Observer (a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Algalon the Raid Destroyer</a>) in the Ulduar raid. He is only accessible if you complete a quest that requires the player to kill several bosses in hard mode, and if he's not killed within an hour or so from summoning him, he'll despawn and you have to wait till the raid reset to summon him again. Algalon was <em>not</em> the hardest boss in the game when he was released — that honor went with Yogg-Saron on full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">hard mode</a> (see above) — but he was the one that the fewest raids defeated, between the difficulty of the path to get to him and the difficulty of the fight itself. (As a special bonus, story-wise, if you fail to defeat Algalon, he sends a signal to <em>his</em> superiors to begin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">sterilizing the planet to rid it of corruption so that life can begin anew</a>. Also, in-story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's stated that he could completely and utterly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">wreck</a></em> Yogg-Saron in a fight, and the main thing keeping him from actually doing so is that it would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">annihilate the universe</a></span>.)
</li><li> Jin'do the Hexer in Zul'Gurub was optional; you can actually skip him, and he drops some of the best loot in the dungeon next to Hakkar. Two other bosses were accessible through skill-related means; it was possible to fish up Gahr'zahka by catching fish to make a lure for him, and preparing a certain kind of mojo with Alchemy enabled raids to fight bosses at the Edge of Madness. In the re-released Level 85 Heroic Zul'Gurub, people with enough Archaeology skill can access the optional boss at the Edge of Madness.
</li><li> The Bug trio, Viscidus, and Ouro were all optional bosses in Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. Most, if not all guilds, did the Bug trio because the fight wasn't very difficult and it rewarded good loot. Viscidus is a fight that many guilds skipped because, even at level 80, it's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">a pain</a> in the ass. To defeat Viscidus, he must be frozen; naturally, he can only be frozen by Frost-based attacks, such as Mages' Frostbolt or Shamans' Frost Shock. Once Viscidus is frozen, then everyone in the raid must melee him (yes, even the healers need to). If melee'd enough times, he will shatter. All while attempting to freeze and shatter Viscidus, the raid must survive near-constant AoE Poison damage. Ouro is a fight that most Alliance guilds would skip in favor of C'Thun because A) he offered better loot and B) killing C'Thun at 60 was a significant achievement for raiding guilds. (Horde guilds would run him over due to Poison Cleansing Totem.)
</li><li> A number of dungeons from <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> have a boss that only appears when running the dungeon in Heroic mode. Eck in Gundrak is a good example, as not only does he only appear on heroic, but also appears in a side alcove that opens up after Moorabi is defeated on Heroic.
</li><li> Later introduced with the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion is Lady Sinestra. Only accessible in 10 and 25 man raids, AFTER clearing the entirety of the Bastion of Twilight in Heroic mode.
</li><li> In the Firelands, Ragnaros has a new fourth phase on Heroic mode.
</li><li> In Mists of Pandaria Patch 5.2, there is a bonus boss at the end of the Throne of Thunder raid, Ra-den. He is only accessible after you have defeated the previous 12 bosses. On <em>heroic mode</em>. Oh, and you know nothing about how to defeat him. Have fun!
</li><li> The <em>Legion</em> expansion added what had to be the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> case of this yet, in the form of Endgineer Omegaplugg. To fight him, you have to take a max-level group into the low-level dungeon of Gnomeregan, work your way to the normal final boss of that place, and then find and press a hidden button in that room to summon him. Omegaplugg has many AOE abilities that can two-shot endgame-geared characters, making the fight extremely difficult on top of all that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory">The Cow King</a> showed up in an event to commemorate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>'s 20th birthday. Getting to him, required killing a sneaky-looking goblin who appeared in some of the raids, which opened a portal to Cow Level in Darkshire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has the Army of Me badge, unlocked via a special option in a Villain Side story arc.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game features plenty of end-game contents, some of which are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> while others are this, or both. Some of the content is loosely tied with the overall plot; completing them isn't necessary to advance the story. Hard Mode and Extreme Mode versions of the Primal fights are available to tackle, along with the bosses in the intermediate 24-man, and hardcore 8-man, raids, with the latter having a Savage version which brings more mechanics to challenge the team.
</li><li> <em>The Unending Coil of Bahamut</em> takes the cake as the first raid content to be pegged at the <strong>Ultimate</strong> difficulty. And it certainly doesn't disappoint, as it consists of embellished and fiercer version of the final turn for each part of the Binding Coils of Bahamut (Turn 5, 9 and 13), with all of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">pulling all their stops at the get-go compared to regular Coil</a>, culminating with Bahamut Prime dropping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">a mini-Dalamud</a> to the stage and sends powerful shockwaves that will wipe the party if not mitigated with a Limit Break from a tank-role player. And then after the Tera Flare phase, Bahamut Prime proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">unleash its inner rage</a> in its golden form, and starts to spam Akh Morn and Exaflare, and if it was not defeated quickly it will begin to spam Morn Afah (appropriately means "eternal death" in dragon language) until the whole party is wiped out. Clearing the Unending Coil demands a great amount of team synergy and their proficiency with the battle mechanics much more than any other raids before it, to the point that Deltascape 4.0 Savage (the highest-level raid content when Unending Coil was released) is a mandatory requirement <em>just to enter it</em>. Furthermore, at the time of its release, none of the participants were able to clear it within the first week, with the world first clear happens on the 11th day after the release.
</li><li> The Weapon's Refrain is just as difficult. Just like the Unending Coil, this fight is a gauntlet against several bosses in a row; Specifically: Garuda, Ifrit, Titan, Lahabrea, and the Ultima Weapon. In addition to the moves they usually do being supercharged, the whole encounter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">giant puzzle</a>, as the party needs to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">hit the Primals with their own attacks to power them up</a></em> in order to obtain extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Breaks</a> for use against Lahabrea, and failing to do so will <em>always</em> result in a wipe. A Level 3 Caster Limit Break is required to destroy several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">self-destructing Magitek Bits</a> before they explode, a Level 3 Healer Limit Break is needed to cleanse an otherwise uncleansable Doom debuff Lahabrea places on the party, a Level 3 Melee Limit Break is needed to finish off Lahabrea before he casts Dark IV to wipe the party, and a Level 3 Tank Limit Break is needed to survive the Ultima Weapon's opening attack of Ultima. Then, once the Ultima Weapon fight begins proper, <em>dying to it causes it to build up its own Limit Break faster</em>. If the Ultima Weapon reaches 100% charge, it begins dragging players one at a time into the air and blasting them with an attack that deals 999,999 damage <em>and prevents their corpses from being targeted, in turn preventing them from being raised</em>.
</li><li> Memoria Misera is a very difficult boss. Based on a previous solo instance boss battle against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emperor Varis (or rather, a highly embellished version of him)</span>, much of the difficulty from the fight comes from mechanics that require precise synchronized placement of all party members to avoid stacking damage. As the fight moves into its second and third phases, a pair of DPS checks come into play as well, the first requiring both tanks to interacte with designated spots on the map to catch a massive sword beam and succeeding in the ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand">Active Time Maneuver</a> to survive (emphasis on <em>both</em> tanks: if one of them is out of play, the other will quickly die and the party will wipe) while the party takes continuous damage, making it a taxing healer check as well. The second DPS check is accompanied by two attacks, one that requires the players to stack to mitigate damage and another that requires the players to spread out to avoid getting hit repeatedly. Each new phase also forces players to contend with more simultaneous mechanics going off. Any mistakes made in dealing with these mechanics can result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>. Thankfully, the rewards for winning the fight are well worth it, consisting of high-end armor with five materia slots per piece.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has the final bosses of the Clan Dungeons, and the three final bosses of The Sea.
<ul><li> Mother Slime in the Slime Tube, who can be up to level 8700. She can also gain immunities to elemental damage and is immune to stunning moves and items.
</li><li> The Necbromancer in the Haunted Sorority House, who has three forms and a special attack that takes 30% of your HP.
</li><li> Hodgman the Hoboverlord in Hobopolis, who has 25000 HP, gains buffs depending on whether his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">dragons</a> are defeated or not, and is one of the few enemies that can flip out unprovoked. Defeating him earns you one of many powerful items, but the strongest, his Imaginary Hamster, requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun">getting to him in one day and in under 1100 turns</a>. Due to the timing involved, this means not killing any of his lieutenants.
</li><li> Dreadsylvania has two possible bosses for each of the three zones: the Dreadsylvania Woods ends with either Falls-From-Sky, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">bugbear made of stars</a> that hits with a variety of powerful elemental attacks, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">the Great Wolf</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf">of the Air</a>, a hard-hitting winged werewolf; the Dreadsylvania Village has either Mayor Ghost, who randomly prevents you from dealing elemental damage, using spells or skills, or using combat items in the next round, or the Zombie Homeowner's Association, which is virtually immune to abilities that don't do extra damage to group monsters; finally, the Dreadsylvania Castle ends with either the Unkillable Skeleton, who scales to your stats, prevents use of combat items, and is only vulnerable to physical damage, or Count Drunkula, who takes drastically less damage unless your character is severely inebriated, and must be defeated in ten rounds. <a class="urllink" href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Advanced_Dreadsylvania_Mechanics#Bosses_and_Superbosses">There exist Hard Mode versions of the Dreadsylvania bosses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which are even <em>more</em> dangerous but drop even better loot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Good luck finding them without a guide.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">The Sea</a>, meanwhile, has bosses that are even tougher than the Clan Dungeon bosses, matched only by the Hard Mode Dreadsylvania bosses:
<ul><li> Shub-Jigguwat, Elder God of Violence, who saps all your MP (and some of your HP) at the start of combat, is immune to stuns, and is virtually immune to elemental damage. He will also retaliate fiercely if you hit him with anything but a basic attack.
</li><li> Yog-Urt, Elder Goddess of Hatred, who sticks you with an effect that lasts about eight rounds, caps all your stats around 30, prevents you from using skills, does massive damage to you each round, <em>and</em> prevents you from attacking her on pain of death. She's also immune to stuns and won't let you use the same item twice in one combat.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dad Sea Monkee</span>, who can only be faced in the first place if you beat both of the first two Sea bosses as <em>all six character classes</em>, combine their special drops into six pieces of equipment, and wear them all. He's immune to being stunned, prevents you from using combat items, and is vulnerable to only one of the six types of damage each turn (including physical and all five elements). The order of those vulnerabilities is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">only vaguely hinted at in the cryptic, unsettling message you get before facing him.</a> On top of all that, you have twelve rounds to defeat him before you lose the fight automatically.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonNest">Dragon Nest</a></em> has several high level maps feature alternative routes with different bosses.
</li><li> There are several in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Commander Mokan in the Battle of Rishi flashpoint on Hard Mode is a very intense coordination and healing check. He has two types of compounds, compound seventeen and compound nine. The group needs to have a balance of both compounds in order to survive. If the player gets 5 stacks of compound nine, they will die instantly. The boss will deliver lots of stacks of this compound to the tank and the healers can only cleanse one stack unless the tank uses injectors of compound seventeen to reduce the number of stacks. Mokan will release compound seventeen to the group so they need to take compound 9 to reduce the damage. It's no surprise that most groups skip this boss.
</li><li> The Dreadful Entity. To summon the Entity at all, Dreadtooth, the world boss of Section X, must be defeated with full stacks of Dreadful Resurgence. The fight is quite a task, almost demanding a full operation's group. To add to it, Dreadtooth only gains stacks as he is defeated. Upon spawning, he starts with two. When he spawns again, he has four and so on. If Dreadtooth is defeated, he drops a special amulet which can be used to summon the Entity during the "Terror From Beyond" operation. But only in 16-player Hard Mode. To add to this, he has a special ability, Dread Touch, which is mitigated by another item: the Dread Guard's Corrupted Mask.
</li><li> Upon Dreadful Entity's defeat, the Dreadful Entity drops an item called the Dreadful Orb. This is used to summon the second bonus boss - The Hateful Entity, in the Scum and Villainy operation on 16-player Nightmare Mode. Boasting the same abilities as Dreadful, but hitting much harder and requiring very specific kiting tactics to defeat, the sight of players with his unique title are rare indeed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has two types of bosses in its lore: the first are known as quest bosses - one time fights to advance plot; the other are bonus monsters, where killing them is either a fun way of passing the time, or provides high level loot not available anywhere else. Many of them require quests to access, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undead">Corporeal Beast</a>; while others are just in a dangerous area, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Chaos Elemental</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> title is granted to anyone strong enough to beat 5000 of these bonus bosses, which includes 100 kills of each kind of boss.

It has about ten times as much health as any other boss in the game and throws explosive barrels at you. Fortunately, you get unlimited ammo for the fight. Unfortunately, its large amount of health makes it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a>, taking around half an hour to beat. To get to it you need to press the up arrow at a very specific location shortly before the final boss, which will only show the icon to indicate it's available if you have previously finished the game on Hard, found all the nukes on Hard, and found them all on this play-through, again, on Hard.

This is only the first step in getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. The player will then fight Mosquitus in the final stages instead - defeating it with Zero is the requirement for X to obtain the Z-Saber. There is also Bit and Byte, whom you can find and battle in hidden areas in stages. If you beat them using their weaknesses to score the final hit (Frost Shield or Triad Thunder for Bit and Tornado Fang or Ray Splasher for Byte), then they will be replaced in the final stage by Press Disposer. If even one of them is left alive, however, then the player will fight Godkarmachine O Inary in the final stages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2">X2</a></em> has the X-Hunters, Serges, Violen, and Agile, who can be encountered in hidden areas in stages. If you beat them at the first opportunity, you receive parts of Zero, and collecting all of them enables you to skip the fight with Zero in the final stage. You still fight the X-Hunters in the final stages, regardless of whether you fought them before or not, though.

Unlike their original appearance, however, they only give you bolts to buy weapons with. Cut Man is hidden in Duo's stage halfway through the game. Wood Man doesn't play the trope straight, though, as you fight him right before the continue point in Search Man's stage.

</li><li> In the Conqueror set, there will be a small chance that, instead of the usual boss charts, you'll get <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdc4e1_u3Bo">Thor TP<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; given that getting this song is excruciatingly random (or perhaps just insanely difficult, considering the theory that you'll have to get EXACTLY 98% or 94% accuracy), one does not have many chances to practice this song and will have to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> videos. A hacked mission in Platinum Crew (in celebration of the Mid-Autumn Festival) spat up <a class="urllink" href="http://i270.photobucket.com/albums/jj81/hiyorigawa/647.jpg">a chance to practice it constantly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> until it was removed, presumably after Pentavision's warning to the Chinese PlatCrew management.
</li><li> In Technika 2, the Super Speed set brings us <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_QVFGjiWvg">D2<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a song running at 356 BPM (approximately 1.5 times faster than Son of Sun); and to unlock this song, you'll have to play a very, very buggy song called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdSk3Ofhvww">BEE-U-TIFUL<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose difficulty comes from a painfully brutal segment featuring pinks that follow the melody and syncopated repeaters. This song is very likely to leave you in a worse state than if you had tried to unlock Fermion SP in Technika 1.
</li><li> This applies to all Club Mixing sets in general from the second game onwards, really, with the change in mechanics and criteria on how to reach a boss in a set. Whereas in the first game the boss is determined by the number of MAXes you've accrued during the set, now the boss you play depends on the difficulty of the set you've chosen.
</li><li> Notable examples from <em>Technika 3</em>:
<ul><li> The high boss of the Sound Lab set is a 2011 rendition of Supersonic by the Pentavision Sound Team. Break! MX is a mandatory song to reach Supersonic. As of writing, Sound Lab is the only way that Supersonic 2011 can be played, outside of the Summer Special Mission last year.
</li><li> Hyper Speed's high boss is Bamboo on Bamboo MX. The mandatory songs to reach BOB are Now a NEW Day MX and Right Back MX. While not as fast as the other songs in the set, NAND is still troublesome due to the hold note management present throughout. Right Back has one of the messiest new MX charts, as most of the notes tend to overlap with one another. Add to the fact that the screen must register your finger being lifted off, and you'll find yourself accruing Breaks and Misses back and forth.
</li><li> Fatality, one of the most difficult disc sets along with T2's Maximum set, features a high boss in the form of Xeus MX, which is Thor on steroids, thus in the same league as D2 and Cypher Gate in difficulty. Like other Maniac performance sets, the prerequisite involves playing two specific songs. In this case, they are AD 2222 and Angel. Like other similar charts, Angel's MX chart is designed to push players beyond human capabilities, with (glitch-laden) tiring repeaters being its primary challenge. Many consider this to be HARDER than Fatality's Low Boss (Supernova).
</li><li> Xeus during the first few weeks after the release of Fatality was impossible to win due to a glitch that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">did not recover the groove gauge at all, in addition to judgments other than Rainbow MAXes draining the gauge</a> in the process. Thankfully, this was fixed ASAP.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani">BEMANI</a> games in general usually have an unlockable Extra Stage with one or more "boss" songs, which are always among the hardest in the game. Do well enough on that and you'll get to play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, usually named either "One More Extra Stage" or "Encore Extra Stage", and is generally the hardest song in the game (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">gets progressively harder with each subsequent installment</a>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX">beatmania IIDX</a></em> is known for having elaborate Extra Stage systems where, on your Extra Stage, you enter a special screen where you select one of several different boss songs.

Unlike every other character, he doesn't have one specific set of combos, meaning that his fight will be unique almost every time. Beating Pander as Robo-Z Gold, the game's standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, lets you play as him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FredericResurrectionOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FredericResurrectionOfMusic">Frederic: Resurrection of Music</a></em> has three optional songs/opponents that can be fought in Arena Mode.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai">maimai</a></em> has the Challenge Track system, in which you get to play a new song with a limited number of lives. Getting anything below a Perfect will take lives away. The newer the challenge, the less lives you have; if you go for it on the first day it's available, you have only one life (i.e. get an All Perfect or else you fail).

They are the highest forms of the Greatwyrms that Euden had recruited through the first five chapters of the game who are now testing to see if he's worthy of wielding their true power. Each one starts with a screen filling attack which will kill you in one hit unless you're sufficiently prepared for it. The Agito Invasion involves a new strain of bonus boss in that they're not only humanoid, but they have their own motives for why they do what they do.

The next attack involves a pillar attack that, once locked onto someone, requires everyone to group up together to mitigate the damage or the target gets killed in one shot. At the two minute mark, he unleashes tornadoes that will go left to right or right to left depending on which one is marked.

She shoots out fireballs that leave volcanoes on the ground that are used to hide from her Hellfire attack that can deal big damage to the party. She also has a pillar attack that has to have everyone grouped up together to mitigate the damage or the target dies. Finally she does Grand Muspelheim that leaves a large chunk of the map on fire, allowing only ranged units able to hit her before doing another pillar attack. As she's close to defeat, she does Grand X-Muspelheim which now does an x-shaped pattern on the map.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">High Mercury</a> is only slightly easier in that melee units won't need a wyrmprint to tank her first attack, though she has plenty of one hit kills up her sleeve with a 180 degree tail swipe, bubble blast and whirlpools. Four bubbles are then summoned that will allow each member of the party to get into to survive the waterfall attack, but if another member occupies the same bubble, it pops, meaning someone is going to die. After getting past that, she traps a random member in a water cage which has to be freed, then sends a homing bubble at another random member which has to be led away or they or someone else will die. After that, she goes to the middle of the room and conjures up a bubble storm that splits into more bubbles if they're attacked. Another waterfall will happen, but fiends will appear to try and burst the bubbles. Once the pattern is done, the trick is more that it's a damage race due to how high her HP is.
</li><li> While not one of the High Dragons, the Mercurial Gauntlet adds Fafnir Roy III who's meant to challenge only the best compositions of each element party. It starts off simple enough, but once an element hits 20 is when things start getting challenging. Getting each element to 40 is a very high risk high reward deal as it gives out rupies, mana, eldwater and for every 25 levels, Twinkling Sand which is used to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">tier five rank 2 and 3 weapons</a>.

</li><li> They exist in many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games:
<ul><li> Ruby Weapon and Emerald Weapon in the international version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> has Minerva. Genesis's best form is <em>nothing</em> compared to her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> currently ends at the Midgar storyline, but it has two of them. The first one involves completing all of Chadley's reports for the right to challenge Bahamut for his summon materia. Completing all of the Wall Market Colisseum battles and Shinra VR battles, especially on Hard mode, allows you to go through a gauntlet of all the summon bosses to face Pride and Joy, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> of the Proudclod boss fought near the end of the original game's Disc 2. Even worse, you can only do this challenge on Hard.
</li><li> Ultima and Omega, or Ultima Weapon and Omega Weapon, appear in many of the games, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. Omega also features prominently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a></em>. Ultima was a mandatory boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, under the name Atma Weapon. Omega and Ultima are storyline bosses in XI's Chains of Promathia expansion, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Bosses</a> to boot.
</li><li> The Monster Arena monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, and the Dark Aeons and Penance in the International/HD versions. Some of the Dark Aeons were required encounters if you want to backtrack to certain areas. Penance is entirely optional, and he's accordingly brutal... 12 <em>million</em> HP, potent attacks that devastate an unprepared party, and supporting limbs that do even more fun damage.
</li><li> The Via Infinito monsters, led by Paragon and Trema, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>. Black Elementals with the ability to just use Ultima at 255 magic whenever it wants, Chac for bypassing stone status resistances or debuffing all stats by TEN with Heaven's Cataract or Concherer who isn't too bad but IS a brick wall of defense.
</li><li> The Fiend Arena in the International/HD re-release of <em>X-2</em> has quite some nasty customers in their tournaments. Expect daunting foes such as Bahamut with over 100,000 HP and a sure-hit kill attack for 9999 damage per girl (all used at leisure), enhanced human enemies (Baralai, Nooj, Gippal, etc) with jacked up stats and brand new cheapo moves to annihilate before a chance is had. The toughest, though, is Almighty Shinra, with potent spells meant to decimate the party right off the bat, and regular nasties such as Paragon and Trema above as regular battles.
</li><li> <em>X-2</em> also gives us Major Numerus, a four headed, four staged boss with tons of abilities to decimate the characters. It's required to fight him with three Iron Dukes equipped (one girl a piece) or else you're just wasting your time.
</li><li> Hell Wyrm, Yiazmat, Behemoth King, the eight non-story line Espers (which includes Zodiark), Omega Mk. XII, etc. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. To date, Yiazmat is the boss with the most HP in all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> (a grand total of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">50 million</a></em>), and can take multiple rounds to defeat. To make matters worse, Yiazmat is a rare Bonus Boss that requires a Bonus Boss to even begin the side mission — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Hell Wyrm</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em> had Upsilons A1 (leveled somewhere in the 60s) and A2 (Level 96) and the Level 99 mage clan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">special secret random encounter boss that was only able to be encountered on the walkway heading towards Tiamat.</a> The boss was a mecha named Warmech and had damage capabilities surpassing Tiamat.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> in <em>Dawn of Souls</em> for the GBA included optional dungeons with bosses from <em>III, IV, V</em>, and <em>VI</em>; only Omega and Shinryu from <em>V</em> were much harder than the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> The PSP <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a> remake ups the ante with Chronodia, who has 8 FORMS! It's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Boss</a>, though; which one you fight depends on how you did in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> prior to fighting her. Either way, she's pretty hard.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity-1 Weapons</a> and strongest armors are stored in chests in the final dungeons, guarded by powerful monsters. The Soul of Rebirth bonus mode also has Ultima Weapon, which grants the Ultima spell to Minwu upon defeat.
</li><li> The <em>20th Anniversary Edition</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> has a sideplot revolving around the character of Deumion the guardian. It includes two new superbosses at the end of the Arcane Labyrinth. One is Phrekyos: a badass-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound">Hell Hound</a> summoned forth by Deumion to test your strength. It's both a capable mage and a hard hitter. The second is Deumion himself, but only in case you wish to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> Destroy that he guards with his life. Deumion's not really hard, but he's got more HP than any other enemy in the game and can cast the Dark Emperor's Starfall spell, among others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>: The DS and later versions have the Iron Giant, a beast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">massively high defense</a>, powerful physical attacks that cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">a wide variety of status effects</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Meteor</a> spell, and who gets four attacks per round. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">After you've depleted enough of his HP</a>, his regular attack gets replaced with one that does double damage and hits all party members at once. Have fun!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> had four optional boss fights against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Eidolons</a>: Asura, Leviathan, Odin, and Bahamut. Only one of these was particularly difficult. The others required very specific strategies rather than a highly leveled party to defeat, making them closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Bosses</a> than anything else. This was fitting, as the battles were intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">tests of your skill</a>. Furthermore, several powerful weapons and armor in the final dungeon are guarded by horribly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> bosses, including one that hits the entire party with unblockable Doom when the fight starts (giving you a time limit before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>). The GBA version added some more, most notably, a modified version of Easytype Zeromus and Brachioraidos, a dragon tough enough to be a superboss even relative to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> it appears in. The DS remake removed most of those added by the GBA version, but features two new optional bosses only accessible through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>: Geryon and Proto-Babil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears">Final Fantasy IV: The After Years</a></em> features the return of the below-mentioned Omega and Shinryu in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBonanza">final</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">dungeon</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Deathgaze and Ultima Weapon</a>. The PSP version adds Lost Babil, a humungous mecha that requires a completed file and three parties to fight it: one for the lower body, one for the upper body, and one for the inner CPU, which can be repeated indefinitely for Soma Drops and Silver Apples. The PC version removes the crossover bosses and adds back some of the bonus bosses from <em>Final Fantasy IV Advance</em>, including Lunar Odin, Lunar Leviathan, and Lunar Bahamut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a> Advance</em> as three new boss espers: Leviathan, Gigantuar, and Gilgamesh. There are also five bosses found wandering in a pit within the Dragon's Den - Dark Behemoth, Abyss Worm, Gargantua, Earth Eater, and the Malboro Menaces and bosses-in-chests: Neslug, Plague, and the Flan Princesses, which use massive recovery, Doom to all, and Berserk to all, respectively. Kaiser Dragon is a monster that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> of the original game and, due to having an associated monologue, seems to have been intended to have been a bonus boss in the original version, but to have been cut for time. The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> leading up to him is full of bonus bosses, in the form of souped-up versions of the Eight Dragons, each much stronger than other bosses in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> had two of these, Omega and Shinryu, both who gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">trinkets praising your deed</a> upon death, and who made Neo Exdeath look like a marshmallow peep in comparison .
</li><li> <em>Final Fantasy V Advance</em> was especially brutal with these, creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> full of them. This included such prestigious opponents as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enuo, the frickin' original creator of The Void, which was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> that was Exdeath's entire goal, and something that he couldn't control in the end;</span> Omega MK II and Neo Shinryu, souped-up versions of the bonus bosses of the original game, both of whom made their originals look like marshmallow peeps in comparison (Omega MK. II was very notable, housing a huge floor full of copies of Omega, each one as strong as the bonus boss of the same name, proving just how much stronger the players had to be to stand a chance.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has several, some of whom will join you as Guardian Forces once defeated. The Brothers are optional, as are the Jumbo Cactaur and Odin. Diablos best fits the description, as he's designed to grow in power at the same rate as the main party, thus making him a tough challenge at any level.
</li><li> Ozma (unique in that his difficulty has little to do with inflated stats and almost everything to do with proper strategizing, albeit with more than a hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>) and Hades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>. Kinda complementary - Hades turns out to be a legendary synthesist, and one of the rewards for beating Ozma is something you can synth off to obtain Ark, the ridiculously over-the-top summon. There's also the Tantarian, another boss whose difficulty is based on strategy rather than just stats. Beating him nets an accessory that teaches the very useful Auto-Haste ability.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> continues the tradition with Vercingetorix, boss of the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Mission</a>. This bad boy has 15.8 million hitpoints and can't even be accessed until after you beat the game. But it's easier to beat by simply poisoning him and then guarding for the entire battle; this is because poison deals damage based on maximum HP, and Vercingetorix, as mentioned, has a <em>lot</em> of it. Long Guis also have even more HP, huge stats, and immunity to every form of status debuffs compared to Vercingetorix.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em> features several optional bosses, three of which are absolutely brutal. The Long Gui returns, and despite only having a quarter of the HP it had in <em>XIII</em>, it's still extremely tough to put down. Yomi is a weaker (but still formidable) version of Vercingetorix. And finally, there's Raspatil, a horrifyingly powerful Undying Cie'th that's probably the hardest fight in the vanilla game.
</li><li> The DLC Coliseum battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em> are all nasty, especially Jihl, the one person everyone who played <em>XIII</em> wanted to kill and Gilgamesh, who has almost 10 million HP and can heal himself. The most notorious monsters in the Coliseum, however, are Snow and Valfodr. First off, before you can fight Valfodr, you fight Snow, who has 10 million HP, and if you don't provoke him into attacking someone else and he continues to attack the same character for a set amount of time, he will use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> attack. Once you defeat him, you fight Valfodr, who has five increasingly difficult forms, progressively getting harder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> has its own flavor of Bonus Bosses. In the first playthrough you are capable of taking on the game's two superbosses, the Aeronite and Ereshkigal. Afterwards, if you go on to play Hard Mode, they can be fought again; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">their stats and health go through the roof</a>, with Aeronite getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">potentially 50 million HP</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are two in the base version: The first is the the Adamantoise, which is probably the largest boss ever in the series and also one of its longest encounters taking about 3 in game days, or 2 hours in real life to defeat. Beyond that, the game shipped with three other notables in Naglfar, Ayakashi, and MA-X Angelus-0, with the former two being the only enemies to break the launch level cap, and the later being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">random encounter</a>. Several others have been added as DLC since release.
</li><li> Royal Edition added the recurring bonus boss Omega as a Solheim superweapon forged to fell the Astrals. And surely enough, it was indeed imprevious to attacks from them and conventional weapons. Only Royal Arms and top-tier Elemancy spells could do a dent against Omega, though the immunity switched from conventional weapons to Royal Arms whenever it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has plenty, and tends to use the toughest ones as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">walking sequel hooks.</a>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">First game</a>:
<ul><li> The Clock Tower Phantom (gives you the last Stop spell upgrade), as well as many of the tournaments.
</li><li> The international release of the first game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus">added</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Sephiroth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Ice Titan</a>, and Kurt Zisa. While the only prizes for beating them in that version were experience and bragging rights, the Final Mix version gives you decent rewards for beating them (the physically inclined One-Winged Angel Keyblade for Sephiroth, the magically inclined Diamond Dust Keyblade for Hydros, and the Zantetsuken ability (which gives Sora a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> attack, though it doesn't always work) from Kurt Zisa). It also adds the Unknown, who is easily the hardest boss in the game. This is justified immensely when you find out who he is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xemnas, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Second game</a>:
<ul><li> In the international release, the only boss that you don't have to fight to beat the game is Sephiroth; like the first game, you have to fight him one-on-one, and he's ridiculously tough. Aside from that, the only things that could count are the Coliseum tournaments.
</li><li> The third level of the Assault of the Dreadnought gummi ship course ends with a boss fight against the Hunter-X, which has every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">Spam Attack</a> that the other enemy ships do plus an attack that's easily strong enough to one-shot most of the player's ships and hits half the screen.
</li><li> The Final Mix version went overboard with this: First, there are the five Absent Silhouettes, shadowy spirits of the members of the Organization who had died in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">the previous game</a> that have different tactics and a different level of strength since then. But those are child's play compared to what you can access after you've beaten the game; at the end of Hollow Bastion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Radiant Garden</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, the Cavern of Remembrance (itself a trial to get through), you find the Garden of Assemblage, where data replicas for all thirteen members of the Organization await, and their threat levels are jacked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. But none of those replicas, not even Xemnas, can match the last Bonus Boss in the game: a mysterious armored Keyblade Master named the "Lingering Will", found through a portal in Disney Castle. He is hands-down <em>THE hardest boss in the game</em>...and like the Unknown, it's very easily justified when you find out who he is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terras soul, trapped inside his armor after Master Xehanort took over his body in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em></span>.

God help you if you only pack one Curaga and kept the cursor on it. The worst part, the only way to know which way to dodge for the attack is to use the bottom screen, which you never use during any other fight, to see where his icon is headed.

The first really bad one, the first Halloweens Fortress Crab raid, had <em>99,000,000</em> HP at <em>level 1</em>. Later ones can take a pounding from even the most powerful parties whaling on it with the metagames top medals.

After defeating the Champion, one of the Eon Pokémon (Latios for <em>Ruby</em>, Latias for <em>Sapphire</em>) and Rayquaza can be caught. Through event-exclusive items, Lugia, Ho-oh, the other Eon Pokémon, and Deoxys can be fought. Mew can also be found this way in <em>Emerald</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Emerald</em>, Rayquaza can be captured <em>before</em> you take on the Elite Four (and Groudon and Kyogre take its place as Bonus Bosses). You can also choose which Eon Pokémon you encounter after entering the Hall of Fame. A traditional example appears in the form of Steven, who turns from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> in <em>Ruby/Sapphire</em> to Bonus Boss in <em>Emerald</em>, having stepped down from his position as Champion. After entering the Hall of Fame, you'll find him in a secluded cave in Meteor Falls with a team identical to the one he has in <em>Ruby/Sapphire</em>, except <em>twenty levels higher</em>. The seven Frontier Brains at the Battle Frontier also count, as they are only available after you beat the Champion. Additionally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire</a></em>, you can battle <em>all of the other Legendaries from Generations II, IV, and V,</em> along with the previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Mythical</a> Deoxys.

Also, Regigigas's status is tarnished somewhat, as in <em>Platinum</em>, it's dropped to Level 1. Also, through now legitimately unobtainable event items, players can fight the Mythical Pokémon Darkrai and Shaymin. In <em>Platinum</em>, an event Regigigas can unlock areas where the Regi trio can be battled and caught. Arceus can also be found in the Hall of Origin, but the item needed to access it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">was never officially released</a>.

The Subway Bosses of Unova's Battle Subway, can be considered this after one defeats the Champion. As for Legendary Pokémon, Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion can be found through a sidequest, and post-Elite Four, Landorus can be battled if the player has a Tornadus and a Thundurus, and Kyurem can be fought in the Giant Chasm.

The matches where the player defends their Champion title are also altered, with two trainers being replaced, while the two rival characters have much stronger teams this time. The player can also revisit the first trial, but with the Totem Pokemon at a much higher level. The player also gets a chance to catch a new Ultra Beast during the post-game, with the original Ultra Beasts being found in their own dimensions.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em> has the Golden Swordsman at the end of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. He's nothing to scoff at the first time you fight him, but he gets even stronger the next few times you fight him.

Defeating all of the Giganto Monsters will result in all of them reappearing as their much stronger EX versions. The bonus dungeon is populated by shadow versions of numerous past bosses, your party members, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Stahn</a></span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Cless</a></span>. The end of EX Tag Arena pits you against powerful versions of past bosses partnered with random members of your party, plus if you defeat them quickly, you'll be rewarded with a bonus fight based on who your lead character is (Most notably, in Ludger's case, a stronger version of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>the final boss</em></span> shows up). Lastly, the end of EX Team Arena pits you against the cameo team of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cless, Mint, Stahn, and Rutee</span> in a battle that's chaotic enough to warrant a special ending scene should you prevail.
</li><li> Also, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts">Tales of Hearts</a></em> bonus boss is nearly IMPOSSIBLE without use of infinite aerial combos or cheats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> has several examples, mostly reserved for multiplayer (whether local, online or both):
<ul><li> The four-legged Elder Dragons (not to be mistaken with the two-legged wyverns) in most games, as well as Kirin the lightning unicorn. Most of them only appear in the highest-tier quests.
</li><li> In <em>Freedom</em>, Yian Garuga is unlocked after hunting 10 Yian Kut-Ku. Its quest is rated with six stars (the highest grade), and it's ill-advised to challenge it until you have a decent postgame gear. In <em>Monster Hunter 2</em>, it can only be unlocked via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> by connecting both games through an USB.
</li><li> In <em>Freedom 2</em> and <em>Portable 3rd</em>, Gold Rathian and Silver Rathalos are unlocked by killing or capturing a combined total of 100 large Wyverns (also including Leviathans in the latter game). Note that <em>Freedom Unite</em> averts this trope with them, since their respective quests are mandatory in order to unlock the G Rank chapters. From <em>3 Ultimate</em> onwards, they're available as soon as you reach the highest-tier quest chapter, thus are demoted to merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss">skippable monsters</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Portable 3rd</em>, Akantor and Ukanlos (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle">originally the respective final bosses of</a> <em>Freedom 2</em> and <em>Freedom Unite</em>) can be fought after completing all single-monster quests in the prior high rank quests, while Alatreon (of <em>Tri</em> fame, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle">also its online final boss</a>) is unlocked upon completion of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Dual Boss</a> monster quests.
</li><li> In <em>3 Ultimate</em>, Hallowed Jhen Mohran is only accessible after the player slays or captures every single large monster (including previous Elder Dragons like regular Jhen Mohran and Alatreon) except Savage Deviljho, Lucent Nargacuga and Abyssal Lagiacrus (which happen to be Bonus Bosses on their own; as Savage Deviljho can only be fought in quests with unstable environments or alternatively through a DLC quest, Lucent Nargacuga is unlocked after reaching HR 40, and Abyssal Lagiacrus is unlocked after reaching HR 70).
</li><li> The endgame multiplayer quests of the original version of <em>Monster Hunter 4</em> consists mostly of souped-up versions of monsters you've previously fought, such as Akantor or Dalamadur, though it also adds the debuting Molten Tigrex (HR 50) and series classic Fatalis (HR 70). The expansion <em>4 Ultimate</em> repeats the trend for G Rank via the Aged Texts, having buffed familiar monsters while also adding Shah Dalamadur and Raging Brachydios. <em>4 Ultimate</em> also has the quests where you fight Apex versions of monsters, each of which is unlocked through a specific condition.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2noit');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2noit" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2noit');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the Apex Tidal Najarala, Gravios, Diablos, Tigrex and Zinogre, you have to hunt a specified combined total of specimens of the species and related subspecies in question. For the Apex Seregios and Rajang, you have to decipher the third and sixth Aged Texts respectively. For Apex Deviljho, you have to clear any of the previous Apex monster quests and accept the Deviljho Arena challenge in the Assembly</span>
</li><li> <em>Generations</em> has the twelve Deviants, monster specimens that have survived numerous battles with Hunters and other monsters and have developed unique and deadly traits. All of them are optional and can only be fought through a unique series of quests. Hunters must spend special permits to post these quests because of how dangerous the Deviants are. Indeed they are, as the first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Redhelm Arzuros</a>, is a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>, and the rest go up from there. The expansion <em>Generations Ultimate</em> adds six more, including the Bloodbath Diablos, who can only be fought after hunting the other five new Deviants at least once and defeating the final boss. <em>GU</em> also has the Extra Special Permit Quests at the end of each Deviant's quest chain, which feature a Deviant with health, attack, and resistance buffed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, require HR 100 to join, and have no supplies provided. EX Deviants are not required to defeat to max out Deviant weapons nor earn achievements, but doing so rewards a shiny color palette, Guild Card titles and special icons, and unlocks the ability to fuse Deviant armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld">World</a></em> has the monsters added after the game's release through free title updates: Deviljho, Kulve Taroth, Lunastra, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Behemoth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">Leshen</a>, Rajang, Stygian Zinogre, Safi'jiiva, Raging Brachydios, Furious Rajang, Alatreon, Frostfang Barioth and Fatalis. With the exception of Deviljho, who can be encountered randomly partway into High Rank, they can only be fought after defeating the final boss and during their respective questlines. Additionally, there are Arch-Tempered Elder Dragons, souped-up event-exclusive Elder Dragons with increased strength and sometimes new attacks and behavior that require HR 50 to fight, attainable only in the postgame.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFrom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFrom">The Hellkite Dragon</a> that guards the bridge between the Undead Burg and Undead Parish is more of an obstacle than an actual boss, but players have naturally decided to try to kill him regardless. If you do decide to try to kill him, you have to continually dodge that 1 hit kill fire breath of his and bait him to land on the bridge to actually deal damage. Forget ranged attacks: at lower than 50% health, he starts <em>regenerating</em> at a rate that will almost certainly outpace your ranged attacks, and is tough to overcome even with melee. However, you don't even get anything other than 10,000 souls for killing him, which, at the level you're likely to be at if you do kill him, isn't all that much. So killing this dragon really just ends up being for bragging rights.
</li><li> The game has several in the optional areas of the game. The first one most players see is the Stray Demon, a much stronger version of the tutorial's Asylum Demon that drops a highly valuable Titanite Slab. Others include the magical Moonlight Butterfly in Darkroot Garden, the illusionist Dark Sun Gwyndolin in his father's tomb, and the half-Dragon Priscilla in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel">the Painted World.</a> Priscilla is a little bit more optional tham usual because she won't attack until the player does first, and her dislogue points out that you can exit the boss arena and pass through the Painted World without a fight. The difficulty of these encounters depends on the player's progress through the game and they are much easier than the final boss, but they still provide a unique challenge to those who look for them.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> <em>Artorias of the Abyss</em> adds a new hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel">Bonus Level</a> with several bosses in it, all of them difficult fights. The bonus content even has its own bonus boss; while most of the bosses block off new bonfires and are normally accessible, the black dragon Kalameet is unlocked by a side quest and only gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Calamity Ring as a reward, which double all damage taken.</a> Cutting off his tail creates a powerful weapon, but doing that is even harder than killing him. Adventurous players can also find a fight against two of the first DLC bonus boss at the same time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> The Ancient Dragon is a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> with a lot of health and all of its attacks can kill you in one hit unless you have extremely high Fire resistance. The saving grace is that most of its attacks are fairly telegraphed and can thus be avoided rather easily. Except when it decides to fly up and rain fire on the arena. Avoiding that can be a struggle. Upon defeat, it drops an item that makes the next Bonus Boss easier.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Vendrick</span> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss">Anticlimax Boss</a> whose attacks are slow and easy to dodge, though he can kill you in one hit if you aren't careful. However, he is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> since his defense is incredibly high, making him impossible to defeat if you don't have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Giant Souls</span> in your inventory. Upon defeat he drops nothing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The rewards appear behind a hidden locked door in a different area.</span>
</li><li> The Darklurker is the most obscure. The previous two are at least encountered in the storyline. It is entirely possible to never encounter this boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">if you aren't playing with a guide</a>. You need to discover and join an hidden covenant and fight through three small dungeons filled with dangerous black phantoms just to meet the Darklurker. Your efforts are "rewarded" with a harrowing battle against an eerie angelic figure who hurls powerful pyromancies, hexes, and sorceries at you while flying around the arena. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">thankfully has much lower health</a> than the other two bonus bosses. Upon defeat, it drops its soul which can be traded for a powerful hex. Its defeat also maxes out devotion to the hidden covenant, which comes with its own rewards.
</li><li> Also notable are the DLC challenge areas, four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> optional paths designed for co-op. All of them have appropriate bosses at the end, though all except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sir Alonne in the Memory of the Old Iron King</span> are Invader type enemies or palette swaps.
</li><li> You need four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons">Great Souls</a> to reach Drangleic Castle, and there are four bosses with Great Souls. However, you can kill one boss, take their Great Soul, use a Bonfire Ascetic to resurrect that boss, then kill them again and take a whole new Great Soul again. Repeat ad nauseum and almost every boss in the game before Drangleic Castle is Bonus.
</li><li> Raime the Fume Knight from the <em>Crown of the Old Iron King</em> DLC is one of the toughest bosses within the entire game. It's telling when you find messages outside his fog wall commenting on misery and sadness ahead, because he's statistically the boss with the highest failure rate in the game. Most of his attacks come in hard and fast with his straight sword, but then occasionally he'll swing his ultra greatsword and either shave off a massive chunk of your life or utterly ruin your stamina. After he's lost about a third of his HP, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">he gets serious</a>, buffs his ultra greatsword with a dark flame and gains a new, significantly more aggressive move-set that punishes players that either can't time their dodge right or just stand there expecting to block his strikes. Additionally, if you haven't collected the Smelter Wedges throughout the DLC, Nadalia's idols will keep healing him if he's near them, and if you have Veldstadt's helm equipped, Raime will immediately enter his second phase move-set without you hitting the HP threshold.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> ups the ante with the Nameless King, who is considered one of the toughest direct fights in the entire series. First you fight him on his Storm Drake, the King of Storms, who is so large that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew">locking onto him makes it near impossible to see the Nameless King's attacks from above,</a> combined with a particularly difficult to avoid fire attack from above you can only evade if you start running the <em>instant</em> the Drake starts flying overhead. Once the Nameless King is on-foot, however, it only gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">harder;</a> put the moveset of Ornstein with a super adrenaline boost on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">God of War</a> that is hyper-aggressive, extremely mobile, and can kill even the sturdiest of builds in a handful of blows, and pair this with fighting on a moving cloud background that hinders depth perception. It's not uncommon to see 85% of the fight, at minimum, being spent <em>rolling for dear life.</em>
<ul><li> It's also possible to beat the game without even realising that you can cut the rope bridge in the Catacombs of Carthus to turn it into a ladder to Smouldering Lake, so you end up missing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> battles against the Fire Demon and Carthus Sandworm, plus the battle against the Old Demon King.
</li><li> None of the DLC has to be completed to win the game, meaning that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sister Friede</span>, Halflight, Spear of the Church, the Demon in Pain and Demon from Below, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Slave Knight Gael</span> are somewhat optional, but you can finish the main story of <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> without finding out that the area the Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender's Greatwolf fight is in even exists, let alone getting to it, and Midir's boss arena in <em>The Ringed City</em> requires you to defeat him on a bridge and then figure out where the hell his proper arena is.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series, there is so much extra content and so many bonus bosses that the time taken to defeat them is longer than the main story line. In all of them, however, you face Bass/Forte. Unlike other continuities, here he is a god-like badass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em>:
<ul><li> Usually there's a secret area after beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> where you have to fight upgraded forms of each boss in the game, followed by an all-new secret boss. After doing that, the storyline's final boss is upgraded, with it being the truly strongest boss in the game. The only exception to this is the second game, where after beating the upgraded final boss, you fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an upgraded Rogue after the credits finish.</span>
</li><li> You can also engage a number of repeatable bonus bosses and random people who can Wave Change in <em>2</em>. These include second shots at the storyline bosses to get their Mega cards, plus farmable bosses like Kung Foo Kyd, Gemini Spark, and Cancer Bubble.
</li><li> The third game has a rather unusual take on this with the Omega versions of the bosses, as they can rarely appear virtually anywhere in the game, and also at any point in the story, even before you've fought their regular versions. It's entirely possible to run into one of them <em>right after the gameplay tutorial</em>, despite even weakest of them being far stronger then the final boss. Fortunately, the game is nice enough to not give you a game over for losing to them and also alerts you of their presence by changing the music in the area to a very ominous tune.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission">Mega Man X: Command Mission</a>,</em> meanwhile, had two Bonus Bosses plus another set of nine. Rafflesian and Duckbill Mole gave X, Zero, and Axl new abilities that were useful in what remained of the game by that point. Ninetails and the preceding eight Tails Clan members, on the other hand, who were definitively even more this trope, could only be fought <em>after</em> beating the final boss, making the rewards for beating <em>them</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">worthless.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier">Atelier</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 3 Golden Pigs at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> (Mull's Dungeon) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIrisEternalMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIrisEternalMana">Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana</a></em>, which are significantly more difficult than the final boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIris2TheAzothOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIris2TheAzothOfDestiny">Atelier Iris 2</a></em>, the fights at the Dragon's Nest, particularly the last one against 3 Instant Brownies. However, while they are more powerful than the last boss, the overly-easy battle system makes them no more difficult than anything else, provided the player has stocked up on resurrection items.
</li></ul></li><li> Kisuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a>: Soul Carnival 2.</em> The thing with him, though, is that he can be fought pretty early on in the game, not that you'd have any chance of survival then. Until you clear the Soul Society missions, he'll probably kill you with just one combo. And he has two supports, whereas most bosses only have one, <strong>OR</strong> the fact that his Burning Attack can even hit you if you're off-screen, and it stuns you invariably (as Burning Attacks never miss). When you defeat him, you'll unlock him as a playable character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em> had the Berserker, difficult because it attacked for three to four hundred damage, and often attacked several times before any of your characters got to. Worse, it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">random encounter</a> on the way to getting one of your dragon genes, and was a normal monster.
<ul><li> And in the same area was an even tougher Bonus Boss, the Arch Mage. He has far less HP than Berserker (only about 3,000 compared to the Berserker's 15,000), but regenerates 1,500 of it every single round, which is more than most casual players can deal in a single round, and is capable of hitting just has hard as Berserker. In fact, if you have one living and two dead characters, Arch Mage will USE A SKILL THAT REVIVES THE TWO CHARACTERS. Presumably, he does this simply as a means of embarrassing you further.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV">Breath of Fire IV</a></em> has Rider as a hellish random encounter in Mukto. With 40,000 HP he is already a tough opponent but he also regenerates 20,000 HP every turn...try to overcome that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter">Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</a></em> had Dover, who was the final boss in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. As long as you have a high enough level (around 50), he's not that bad. The only problem is is that his defense switches from regular ol' attacks to Dragon defense. So your time limit is based on how much you have left on the D-Counter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Lin's/Rin's</a> "Shatter!" technique is particularly effective here.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Demi-Fiend</span> battle in the first one, one of the hardest bosses in the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JRPG">JRPGs</a>, if not <em>the</em> hardest boss. Not only will he instantly kill you in the first turn if you have a "forbidden" move set (read: any passive or castable move intended to null, absorb or repel enemy attacks), but the strategy required to defeat him requires a very specific use of one usually worthless skill that you would <em>never</em> use in the main game (to wit, the Null Sleep skill, which nulls all damage one would receive while asleep). How anyone could figure this out without the use of a strategy guide is a mystery for the ages. Beating him unlocks an useful accessory that you can find midgame through the sequel that boosts all stats by 10. And even then, if you do manage to get him down to half health, his High Pixie will fully heal him. If you kill all of his demon companions, he'll insta-kill you. If you go in with any protective moves, he'll insta-kill you. Hell, even with the correct strategy, if you take too long to kill him, he'll just get bored and insta-kill you anyway. To add insult to injury, his battle music is the <em>regular Nocturne battle music</em>, so he may be an uber hard bonus fight to you, but you're nothing more than <em>a random encounter</em> to him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan</span> in the sequel is likewise enormously difficult, if a lot less so than the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Demi-Fiend</span>; you require to continuously cast Charge to boost all your stats to max so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan</span> won't cast God's Breath, his insta-kill move. If you did so, good, he'll only cast Dekaja and put you back at square one. Hurt him enough and take too long and he will cast Diarahan, putting himself back at full health. Anyway, even without their instant kill skills, both are beastly difficult — you <em>need</em> to cap out your major stats to even have a fighting chance, and <em>then</em> there's the actual strategy involved... which simply fails half the time due to bad luck. You also cannot fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan</span> on Normal Mode; you explicitly <em>have to be</em> playing on Hard Mode or your team will be too fearful to even enter his room.

Hits like a truck with the Almighty-type Celestial Ray, which also slaps you with any ailment he wants. Has tons of HP and can cycle through several forms to make the task of damaging him harder. Still not as hard as the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Demi-Fiend</span>.
</li><li> Beelzebub's two forms: Baal Zabul appears in Svadhisthana's underbelly once you unlock it with the Red Key. While he <em>is</em> somewhat strong, he's really nothing to be worried about. Beelzebub proper appears after Baal Zabul's defeat in the Manipura Waterways, and comes back with a vengeance, packing the lethal <em>Death Flies</em> move, which will kill anything not protected against Dark attacks with 100% effectiveness. Even if your charaters <em>are</em> protected, it will hit with a horribly strong Almighty-type attack.
</li><li> Orochi is the last obstacle in the path to the Red Ring, required for another boss. He has <em>eight</em> actions on his turn, can exploit elemental affinities and Criticals with Ice and Lightning attacks, abuse Makakaja and Megidolaon, and has a crapload of resistances. However, he has pathetically small MP for a boss, and will try to restore his tanks with yours. With Null Mute, he turns into a joke after a few turns.
</li><li> Metatron fights you after you enter Ajna with the Red Ring and killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a>. He likes to abuse Makakaja, Revelation, and Fire of Sinai, which can hit several times for Almighty damage with the possibility of instant death.
</li><li> King Frost appears at Coordinate 136 after the defeat of Mick the Slug. Finish the minigame of "find the key" and King Frost will appear at the Princess's Bedchamber. He spams Cocytus, which will almost always freeze, and summons overleveled Jack Frosts to pound you.
</li><li> In the second game, there are fights against the Four Archangels, Shiva, Vishnu, Jack Frost and Seth. The Shiva and Vishnu fights also require you to find a special item for each, from Parvati for Shiva and Narasimha for Vishnu. The pathway to Seth is blocked off until you defeat Shiva and Vishnu and Seth himself blocks the way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan</span>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, <em>Strange Journey Redux</em>, introduces a quartet of even stronger bosses under the command of Louisa Ferre, available only on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. Belial, Lucifuge, Nebiros, and Beelzebub are all capable of shuffling their weakness and obscuring their analysis data after you've just exploited it for free Co-Op damage. They also have very high stats across the board, and if taken too long to defeat, will bombard your party with Doomsday which is almost guaranteed to kill. If you consider the Womb of Grief a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> (as it's not mandatory for the main plot, but does unlock the new endings) then its associated bosses qualify for this trope.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII">Shin Megami Tensei II</a></em> brings back Beelzebub as the ultimate boss.

The bosses of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> are required for the new ending, but many consider them Bonus Bosses as well. These include all of the Fiends (save Matador and the first fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Dante</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVSTheSoullessArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVSTheSoullessArmy">Raidou</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon">Kuzunoha XIV</a>, who is required), Beelzebub, and Metatron. Also present but unconnected to this questline are the Buddhist Four Heavenly Kings, who reside at Bandou Shrine, have maxed stats and the most powerful attacks of their respective elements, and guard the game's most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Magatama</a>.

<ul><li> The game also has a plethora of bosses that can only be fought in their respective challenge quests. While the majority of them pale in comparison to the monsters already listed (the main exceptions are Beelzebub (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">of course</a>) and the New Game + exclusive Astaroth), they still count since most challenge quests are optional. Other than the aforementioned opponents, there's one particularly strong Bonus Boss for each route (though they don't compare to the Fiends, DLC Bosses, Beelzebub, and Astaroth, they're still stronger than other Challenge Quest bosses): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mastema for Law, Demiurge for Chaos, and Shiva for Neutral, with the first two coming form Challenge Quests and the last being the Terminal Guardian's final battle</span>.
</li><li> Special mention must go to the Fiends. Seven of these Fiends (Matador from above being one of them) can only be found in certain locations and the chance of actually encountering them is very low (1 out of 256). Each one has at least five Press Turn icons, will always get the first strike, and will spam Antichthon (massive Almighty damage and all stats lowered) or similar skills if they cannot safely attack you or your demons with their preferred attacks. Defeating them will unlock them for special fusion, and often, a wonderful reward, including some of the game's best equipment.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em> was the sub-series's first entry in this list with Philemon's brutal bonus battle on his EX Dungeon. Notably, he's the ONLY enemy, let alone boss, in the entire game who is immune to the Fusion Skill Armageddon, which, if used, can one-shot even the final boss. Try to use it on him, and he'll hit back with Armageddon R, wiping your party without fail and leading to a game over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has Velvet Room attendant Elizabeth. She can only be fought on the second playthrough by accepting her 55th request and going to the top of Monad. She seems to be nothing more than a thin blonde girl dressed like a bellhop, but she is the most powerful foe in the game, can only be fought one-on-one (she'll kill any other party members right away), gets to attack twice every turn (where you can only attack once), has multiple personas and powerful attacks, and heals herself completely when at low health. Even worse, if any of her attacks are nullified, reflected, or absorbed (which they invariably will be, considering her attack rate and huge range of attacks), she goes berserk and spams a 9999-damage attack (out of max possible HP of 999) nonstop until you die. Amusingly enough, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> version of the game features an upgraded version of your starter Persona which seems to be tailor-made to fight her, as it resists every type of attack, giving you a good overall defense against anything she tosses out and avoiding driving her berserk.
</li><li> While nowhere near as insane as Elizabeth, the Reaper that can be fought in both version of P3 is no slouch when it comes to making a normal player tear their hair out. It's fond of casting spells that hit the whole party for 700-800 damage and going insane on unblockable "almighty" spells if the player sets up reflecting items. This one is more infuriating to the average player due to the fact that he appears when the player spends too long in Tartarus, the game's central randomly generated dungeon. It makes a return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, and is found while opening a chest (the game warns you about it and gives you two chances to back out). It returns again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, where it'll appear if you stay too long on one level of Mementos, though this time around it's possible for it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">catch the flu</a> during certain days, severely weakening it.
</li><li> <em>Persona 3 Portable</em> allows you to fight Velvet Room attendant (and Elizabeth's brother) Theodore if you make the proper choice early on in the game (it's not dependent on gender). However, it cranks things up to 11 with the Vision Quest, which not only contains more difficult versions of the Arcana Shadows, but also allows you to fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Margaret! Yes, the one in the next example. You can still use your full party, but that doesn't make things any easier...</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> continues the tradition with Velvet Room attendant (and Elizabeth and Theodore's big sister) Margaret, who is unlocked by reaching the True Ending after clearing Margaret's Social Link and killing the six other optional bosses (see below). While you can bring in party members and she won't (immediately) wipe them, she's just as frustrating. Nice changes include only healing once. She'll still 9999 Megidolaon you if you bring in a forbidden item, and do so on you every 50 turns. She'll also exploit 1 More relentlessly if you give her the chance in the pattern. She won't kill you if you reflect or nullify her spells, but she shifts her weaknesses around so that she heals if you reflect a spell at her. <em>Golden</em> increases her difficulty by allowing her to go twice every turn, essentially halving the time it takes for her to use Megidolaon, as a way of offsetting the various new features that make things easier.
</li><li> After defeating a dungeon's main boss in <em>4</em>, a new, optional boss appears in the original's place. These tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss">a few orders of magnitude harder</a>. If you fight the Contrarian King as soon as he becomes available, you will die. If you fight him after making your way through the next dungeon and bumping up a good 10 or 15 levels... you'll probably still die. His Rampage attack is overpowered enough to wipe your party in one shot, and he gives himself Fire resistance as soon as the battle starts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fire <em>heals</em> him. He has no actual weaknesses.</span> Naturally he's the first Bonus Boss to become available, and the game will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">encourage you to challenge him well before you're ready</a>. The others aren't quite as difficult, and some actually have elemental weaknesses. If you defeat them, you're rewarded with a large Courage boost and a useful piece of equipment hidden in the boss room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em> continues the tradition of having the residents of the Velvet Room be overpowered bonus bosses, though for the most part things are a bit easier. You can fight Elizabeth several times throughout the game, with her difficulty slowly increasing over time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventually, she's possessed by Zeus</span>. Margaret is also an optional battle, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you fight her two on one with the protagonist you didn't pick, in order to unlock your ultimate Personas</span>. However, it wouldn't be a crossover game if you didn't have a chance to fight Elizabeth, Theodore, and Margaret simultaneously. They can even do an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">All-Out Attack</a> every five turns, though they're more forgiving than they are in the base games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> once again continues the tradition of overpowered Velvet Room attendants with Caroline and Justine. Like the <em>Persona Q</em> battle against Elizabeth, Theodore, and Margret, they battle you as a team. Thus when one falls, the other will revive them, and they can do an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">All-Out Attack</a> when all your team is knocked down. They can also use the new Baton Pass command, making it even more imperative to make sure they don't hit any of your weaknesses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Persona 5: The Royal</a></em> adds a new boss fight in the Third Trimester against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Twins' combined true form, Lavenza</span>. Unlike the Twins, this is just a single boss, but in exchange, they utilize advanced tactics such as using buffs and debuffs and have resistances that constantly shift throughout the fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And they can still perform an All-Out Attack by splitting back into the Twins if given the chance.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth">Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth</a></em>, like the first game, features a fight with all the Velvet Room attendants. This time, there's four phases- Caroline and Justine fight you in the first phase, alongside Margaret in the second phase, Theodore in the third phase and Elizabeth in the fourth phase. In the lead-up to this huge fight, you get to fight each attendant (the twins are fought together) separately, one fight for each Sooty Film you collect from a Special Screening set at the final floor of each movie.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em> holds a few bonus bosses. They appear as unique Free Battles that don't advance the clock. The <em>Overclocked</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> adds a few more.
<ul><li> Ghost Q shows up on Day 2, offering treasure. If you select the correct card (it's totally random), you can complete his stage without having to defeat him, but the other cards turn into doubles of him.
</li><li> Sage of Time shows up on Day 6, hypnotizing civilians. If any of them make it all the way to him, he'll take their souls and you get a game over. You can wake them up to get them to start heading away from him, but if a demon gets them before they get away, same result. Later on the fight, the Sage will brainwash more civilians into entering.
</li><li> Ikusa shows up with a swarm of powerful undead on Day 4. He revives the ones you defeat, and furthermore, you have to prevent any of them from reaching a pair of escape points while you battle him, then clean up after he's gone.
</li><li> Also in Day 5, Nebiros. He appears surrounded by a lot of Vile demons with healing capabilities, meaning he can hide behind them and hit you from afar.
</li><li> The Fallen Morning Star, Lucifer, is the toughest boss of them all, and is also available in the base game. While insanely difficult (infinite range, level 99, etc.), beating him does give you the ability to fuse him. Most people just take advantage of the fact that Recarm gives the revived the next turn to attack, and just suicide run him. Though your strategies are moot if he manages to get Megidoladyne off a couple of times, since every cast boosts its power until the 4th/5th is LETHAL. The first already does 500-600 on everyone!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> has a whole slew of these. Ghost Q and Billiken are available in the first playthrough; the rest will require a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> at minimum. Nebiros, Belial and Alice require you to purchase the perk that lets you fight them.
<ul><li> Ghost Q shows up at a time when you only have the MC in the party—you actually can get one other character into your party before engaging him, but he won't fight you. Also, if you defeat all of the other demons on the field before finishing him off, he'll run away.
</li><li> Billiken is a fairly standard battle, except his battle is the first one in which you can crack Holy Dance, and unless you abuse the hell out of the movement skills, he's programmed to go straight for the Pazuzu that has it and one-shot it. He can also steal money from enemies; if he manages to deplete your wallet, he can hit you with Barrage Strike, which hits for a lot of Almighty damage.
</li><li> The Sage of Time will fight you with mid-tier demons when you're far too underleveled to be able to equip any of the heavier-hitting moves in your arsenal.
</li><li> Lilith sics a bunch of hypnotized civilians which you have to avoid killing with immensely strong demons, <em>and</em> her Temptation skill will wreak havoc amongst enemy leaders. Worse, any male leaders hit by Temptation will be charmed without fail, even with Null Mystic (the Barrier Auto Skill will stop male leaders from being charmed if they have it equipped). Female leaders aren't charmed just as unfailingly, but there <em>is</em> a chance Lilith can charm them anyway.
</li><li> Beelzebub is a vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change Boss</a> with a nigh-flawless defense and incredible attack, with a continuous stream of overleveled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a>.
</li><li> As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to his boss fight in the first game, Belial will regularly hit the entire map with Gomorrah Fire, so you and your demons need to, at least, Null Fire.
</li><li> Nebiros will appear in a gaggle of undead and continuously summon more if you kill them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a> into them if you instead choose to go after him.
</li><li> Finally, Alice isn't as difficult as Lucifer, but she does have Belial and Nebiros fighting with her, both with their signature tricks. Alice herself can easily oneshot entire parties with <em>Die For Me!</em>, remotely drain them to death with Vitality Drain, revive Belial and Nebiros, and speed up their turns.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, <em>Record Breaker</em>, gives you an option to fight the Ticos. One of the biggest bummer about this fight is that they bring back the dreaded <em>Megidoladyne</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tholapsyx the red dragon, thanks to her size and fire attack; buffing the entire party (preferably with Energy Immunity: Fire and Stoneskin) and micromanaging spellbooks is almost mandatory, as opposed to the final bosses, whom you can just whack with sheer force if the party is well-equipped. The reward is 200,000 gold for your keep plus an insane amount of loot, including a cool weapon for paladins and clerics who bothered to take a certain quest in the keep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Mask of the Betrayer</a></em> has its own bonus boss, a seemingly harmless badger spirit that turns into a Gigantic Angry Badger of One-hit-kill Doom if you manage to anger it. Killing it nets one one of the only items in the game to grant permanent haste status (barring the time-consuming item crafting).
</li><li> Also in <em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">One of Many</a> is in your party when you meet the dead god Myrkul, they'll ask if they can eat the god's remains. Unfortunately, rather than eating souls outright like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s curse, One of Many adds consumed souls to its collective. Thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationBackfire">Myrkul overpowers One of Many and takes over</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Storm of Zehir</em>, you can encounter One of Many on the world map, who will probably be impossible to beat the fist time you encounter it (you're thankfully not forced into a fight with it). However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> nature of the game later on, you can return and fight it once you're sufficiently leveled. Beating it will earn you the Imarskarcana, a helmet with good spell resistance, the ability to summon a demon once per day and a few other perks. If you don't want to fight it, you also have the option to feed it your companions for experience points.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> series as a whole has a <em><strong>LOT</strong></em> of bonus bosses; many of them are usually part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quests</a>, and about half of them are post-end game only.
<ul><li> Prevalent in all games except the fifth are the post-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning">three elemental dragons</a> (Great Dragon, Blizzard King and Storm Emperor), who each has an elemental attack that can wipe out your entire party in one hit unless you negate it with specific skill at the right time. From the third game onwards, their defeat also raises the level cap for your entire guild — an important asset for the postgame.
</li><li> Even before end game, there're usually a few bosses that can be fought early on, but definitely not recommended as they are usually far too powerful that early. The Wyvern and Salamander from the first two games are good examples.
</li><li> The third game, <em>The Drowned City</em>, introduced a second exploration map (the sea), thus ramping up the number of bonus bosses in the game. Same deal with the fourth game, <em>Legend of the Titan</em>, and its skyship map.
</li><li> Finally, to top it off, each game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> that houses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of the game, and it goes without saying that they are excruciatingly difficult, sometimes requiring strategy guides that lists what they will do <em>turn by turn</em> just for you to have a chance to beat them.
</li><li> In absence of the elemental dragons, <em>Beyond the Myth</em> has an all-new catalogue of Bonus Bosses: Dryad in Tutelary Forest, the Primordiphant in Jagged Reach, the Zombie Dragon in Fetid Necropolis, Lamia in Lucent Hollows, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star Devourer (the one who killed Arken's race)</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. The Primordiphant is the only one that makes an appearance during the main story, and the objective at that point is to figure out how to <em>avoid fighting it</em> (the sidequest tasking you to face it will only pop up after the main story is completed); all others will start appearing one by one in the postgame.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Super Saiya Densetsu</em>, if Goku becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> during the final battle with Frieza (accomplished by allowing a party member like Krillin or Chiaotzu to die) and he and Vegeta survive to the end of the battle, after the credits you'll get a scene of Vegeta going Super Saiyan and challenging Goku as payback for the humiliation he suffered back on Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em>:
<ul><li> Panthera Cantus is the toughest boss in the entire game. It has the highest attack power of all the Noise and two separate bodies; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a tiger on top and a lion on the bottom</span>. The fight itself can be quite hectic and requires the player to pay absolute attention to what is going on in both screens.
</li><li> In addition, there are four "Boss Noise" on various days (Progfox, Grindcore Minks, Wooly AOR, and Goth Metal Drake), blue Noise symbols that lead to fights against <em>much</em> stronger Noise than average. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, you have to beat them all on Hard. Feel free to whimper.
</li><li> Additional Boss Noise symbols for every non-Bonus Boss except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> appear on various days after beating the game. This is more of a convenience for those going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, since you don't have to go through the entire chapter to fight the boss again, and can retry the fight if you didn't get what you were looking for, with the exception of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, which is annoying since that day has three bosses beforehand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And, yes, as you may have feared by reading below, Reaper Beat and Taboo Minimimoto show up as Blue Noise as well. And, yes, you have to beat them on at least Hard in order to get all of the Secret Reports. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">And, yes,</a> you still need to beat Minamimoto, the harder one, on Ultimate to complete the Infinity + One Pin Deck.</span>
</li><li> Unfortunately, some of these bosses were timed fights, so on your first time through, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">you won if you managed to survive for 30 seconds</a>. No such escape clause in the post-game, and many of these bosses are still intimidating, even having killed the final boss.
</li></ul></li><li> The Black Rabite from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em> looks like a black version of the cute and weak Rabite enemies from the beginning of the game, but is the exact opposite of weak. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Evil in its cutest form!</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a> II</em> has two of these, both within the same chapter. The first is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">black dragon in the "Crossroads", which can be killed to close the teleport to Kuldahar.</span> Players don't actually have to fight it, and can achieve their goal in a much easier way, but the difficulty of the battle alone makes it worth it for many players. The other boss is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Six Lost Followers, in the Kuldahar graveyard. This is regarded by many to be the hardest fight in the game, because A) there are six different enemies to fight at once, B) they are several levels higher than your party, and C) because each has only a few specific weaknesses, being immune to all other forms of attack, and with the weaknesses being different between each member.</span> Victory gives the player the Holy Avenger, the best weapon in the game. Unfortunately, this pisses off quite a few people itself, as the weapon can only be wielded by a Paladin, meaning that there is no reward for anyone without a Paladin in their party.
</li><li> The Gundam RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MSSagaANewDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MSSagaANewDawn">MS Saga: A New Dawn</a></em> has Ultima Gundam and Omega Gundam, made from a mix of parts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> mecha respectively. Their names are obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">homages</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>'s perennial Bonus Boss pair, Ultima Weapon and Omega Weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive">Live A Live</a></em> features several ultra-tough hidden bonus bosses. The caveman chapter has King Mammoth, who offers a decent reward in the King's Fang, as well as the randomly dropped "Soda." The ninja chapter has Majin Ryunosuke, who can be beaten for a weapon that you can also get at the end of the chapter if you don't kill anyone, and Lord Iwama, who drops an item that can deal a decent amount of damage if used in battle. The final chapter has about five, four of which drop the most useful equipment in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> had a few in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Chrysler Building</a>. While most of the bosses are color swaps of the storyline bosses, the giant cockroach and giant bee were exclusive to the building. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The original Eve is at the very top of the building, and defeating her gets you a different ending.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> has seven: Persona, King Kelolon, the Cave Worm, the Blue Dragon, the Holy Beast, Legendary Spirit Sorcerer Fu, and The Immortal One in the Backyard. Players with access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBoxLiveArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBoxLiveArcade">XBox Live</a> can get a new downloadable dungeon with an extra boss <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Professor K, aka The Killalon</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaXtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaXtreme">Grandia Xtreme</a></em>, rather than a new and unique boss, gave you the chance to go back to the old dungeons after beating the final boss, and in one of them you can fight a super-powered level 200 version of a boss you already faced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a> Advance 2</em> features Ragnarok, a wandering special Dragon who only appears after beating the final boss. He will only appear to fight you once a year, and only if you have a specific kind of monster on your farm. If you're not prepared to fight him on the week he comes to visit, too bad for you! His stats are extremely high (especially considering when your monster can first fight him), and he's tough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the dungeon before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>, you are given the opportunity to fight the spirits of the three dragons you defeated. They drop some useful attack items, and they're also guarding chests containing powerful equipment.
</li><li> There's also the Poltergeist-posessed armor set in Fort Magrad, an optional section of the Snowfield on Disc 3 (you travel through this area on your way to Velwebb. Hint: the sword has an instant-kill attack and it always uses it at the character who manages to dispatch it.
</li><li> There's also the four Dragoon ghosts in Velwebb, and Magician Faust at Flanvel Tower, who is the most powerful enemy in the game. Beating him does get you a great reward though in the Phantom Shield along with 30,000 gold. Here's everything you have to go through to get to him, which definitely puts him in this trope by the above definition: Throughout the game, there is a side quest to collect a total of fifty stardust scattered throughout the continent. Every tenth stardust, when shown to the proper character, will give you a different item. The final item is a mirror that is required in order to face Faust. Faust is an insanely powerful Wingly who was second-in-command to Melbhu Frahma, but ends up being a dozen times more dangerous, possibly due to having been alive and studying/training for the entire time his "boss" has been asleep. You then have to find the entrance to Flanvel Tower, following a winding maze of teleporters just to get to the tower. If you do not have the mirror in your possession the first time you see him, he WILL kill everyone in your party with one blow a piece, and you will be unable to touch him. As it turns out, this first Faust is merely a projected image. The real Faust is able to cast his magic through the image even while being twice as deep in the dungeon. And so, obviously, you must finish the maze.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand">Riviera: The Promised Land</a></em> has Hades, the boss who only appear in the extra content section after you complete the game and obtained the Key to Hell from the Zombie Dragon in chapter 6. His Breakout does heavy damage, but he only attack once every 3 of your each character's turns (estimated), so if you keep healing yourself with elixer and attack him, he's a pushover. Of course, the final boss can has its HP brought down by 53% with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Fanelia</a>...
</li><li> All the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge">Geneforge</a></em> games have an 'Expert' level dungeon with the toughest Bonus Boss in the game. Most of them generate repeated creations to add to their attack power, and traps that deal extra damage unless the player has the skill to disable them or at the least reduce their effect. The worst is the Titan of <em>Geneforge 4</em>, which each time it was weakened to low health would shift to a new form, with a new set of attacks, defenses and vulnerabilities, requiring the player to have mastered a wide range of combat abilities. And of course, leaving the dungeon to rest also reset this Boss to its original form and strength.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BahamutLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BahamutLagoon">Bahamut Lagoon</a></em> has special "side quests" - essentially single battles - available throughout the game. One of them, appropriately named Hard Dungeon, is only available in the last seven chapters and is far more difficult than the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlrevis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlrevis">Mana Khemia Alchemists Of Alrevis</a></em> had 5 Bonus Bosses in total: four that were cameos from other Gust games, and the fifth is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>. Each of them are fought individually, but later three of them can team up for a sixth battle, which can be <em>very</em> difficult if the player's not prepared. The only saving grace for that battle is their common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">vulnerability to a certain character's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">normal physical attack</a></em>.
</li><li> After beating Machinedramon and finishing the main story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld">Digimon World</a></em>, you can continue the story and find a new level with high powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> Digimon. At the end is Machinedramon once again, only this time his health is maxed out at 9999 and his stats are also quite high. This is all for bragging rights.
</li><li> While it's "only" a Mod, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> Brotherhood of Shadow</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has a flashback to Malachor V</span>. You're stripped of all your gear, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have to re-create the single-combat against Mandalore that ended the Mandalorian Wars</span>. Comparatively, the canonical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight against Malak is nothing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> features several. First there is Lord Passion, who carries Duster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Shoes</a>, Lil Miss Marshmallow guards a decent weapon for that point of the game, and the King Statue is just there for experience and is ridiculously easy if you know what to do.
</li><li> The Doppelganger in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGUGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGUGames">.hack//G.U.</a></em> games is optional, but is ridiculously difficult and gives some of the most powerful weapons in the games.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em> has several Dragons that don't <em>need</em> to be beaten, but give the player a useful accessory if they are. Genuine Bonus Bosses include the Gold Mecha Robo, the King Poo, and the Golden Poo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:

The Revenants are powerful undead warriors that are managable on their own but get downright nasty with backup such as the ones that drop the Juggernaut equipment. Gaxkang the Unbound is an homage to Kangaxx from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flemeth</span> shapeshifts into a High Dragon.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> helpfully marks its bonus bosses with dedicated Achievements you get for offing them: a Varterral, a High Dragon, Xebenkeck the Desire Demon (who happens to be an old chum of Gaxkang from part one), and Hybris the Pride Demon. The last one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">particularly bad news</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> has no less than <em>ten</em> different High Dragons lurking in various areas, as well as the Desire Demon Imshael (also related to Xebenkeck and Gaxkang). Additionally, there is a <em>secret</em> High Dragon bonus boss, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guardian of Mythal</span>, whom you can only fight after very specific plot decisions, namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if Morrigan never gave birth to a child with the Archdemon's soul <em>and</em> did not drink from the Well of Sorrows</span>.

Both Saurhead and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">BB Trio</a> reappear with "marathon battle" bosses, where you have to beat three of their teams with no break in-between.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> has had several of these across all the games in the series.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has five or six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">super mutant behemoths</a> who you can hunt down. Admittedly, one is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> over the course of the main story, but even then, you could just skip the entire section. Other optional bosses include Commander Jabsco of Talon Company, Lag-Bolt and Enclave Squad Sigma in <em>Broken Steel</em>, and the three Ant Queens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> himself, Caesar. Especially compared to his second-in-command, Legate Lanius, Caesar is pretty weak for a boss, only being about as tough as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a>. However, he's in the middle of the Legion's stronghold, and his personal section (the only one you're allowed to visit) is crawling with dozens of Legion troops. When you get past them, he is protected by eight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guards</a> armed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">shotgun fists</a>, each of which is as powerful as him. At lower levels, Caesar and his guards will usually dogpile you into a corner and beat you to death in a few hits, since said shotgun fists do ridiculous damage and Caesar and his guards are <em>fast</em>. However, if you go there at a later level with a good companion and high level weapons they'll go down easily enough.
</li><li> The four (five with <em>Old World Blues</em>) legendary creatures in <em>New Vegas</em>, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">reskinned</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">upsized</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">overpowered</a> versions of their normal species. Admittedly, a sufficiently leveled character can make short work of most (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legendary Cazador, Legendary Nightstalker, and Legendary Fire Gecko</span>) but the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legendary Deathclaw</span> from the main game, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Legendary</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">Bloatfly</a></em></span> from <em>Old World Blues</em> can usually kill you in... Two hits. Almost always.
</li><li> There's another boss Deathclaw in <em>Lonesome Road</em>, named Rawr. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, even compared to the Alpha Male, and will kill most characters in one hit; it has somehwhat less HP than the Legendary Deathclaw. Defeating him allows you to build one of the most powerful Unarmed weapons from his talons, Fist of Rawr. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Rawr</a> if you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch">Wild Wasteland!</a></span> There's also Gaius Magnus and Colonel Royez, who are only available <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you choose to nuke the Legion or NCR respectively at the end.</span> Both have all of their SPECIAL stats maxed out, and Royez has the third highest HP of any human enemy after Ulysses and Legate Lanius, a Damage Threshold of 24, wields a plasma caster with overcharge ammo, and regenerates his HP very quickly from the radiation.

<ul><li> Swan, a special Super Mutant Behemoth, resides in the Boston Common's duck pond and wields a gigantic hammer fashioned from an anchor. Defeating him nets you the armor-piercing Furious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a>.
</li><li> The optional Quincy Ruins is home to three Gunner leaders, who are backed up by many high-level mooks from the overpasses and other high ground. Two of the bosses wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>, and the one that doesn't, Sgt. Baker, is armed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> Fat Man. Clint wields an Engraging Laser Rifle named Good Intentions, and Tessa wears a unique Raider Power Armor Right Arm named Tessa's Fist (not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName">despite the name</a>). Other Gunner bosses include Captain Wes in the Gunner Plaza, and Captain Bridget at Hub City Auto Wreckers.
</li><li> The Far Harbor DLC has a randomly-encountered legendary Fog Crawler named Shipbreaker. Given that normal Fog Crawlers are already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Bosses in Mook Clothing</a>, this one's insanely difficult to take down, especially because, being a Legendary, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a> and auto-heals when its HP is depleted halfway the first time. Reporting its defeat to Longfellow earns you the Skipper's Last Stand harpoon gun, which grants +150 damage resistance when reloading.

There's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nasca, Valara, Heughes, and Wiseman</span>, who are fought to tie up loose ends; one of them allows access to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>. There's also Arma Prototype M, a.k.a. The Wicked Gawd, who is the final boss of the Coliseum and is <em>absurdly</em> hard.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol">Alpha Protocol</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> SIE will offer to team up with you during the mission where you first encounter her. You can agree to the alliance, or you can attack her (or you can agree, complete the mission, then attack her when you encounter her again at the end of the mission). Not only will she not die when you win, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">your rep with her</a> will increase.
</li><li> All three episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> have some:
<ul><li> Episode 1 has four: two mechas, Din Gareth and Jin Gareth, the sharpshooter Great Joe, and Mintia, an evil version of MOMO.
</li><li> Episode 2 has a metric-buttload of optional bosses encountered in the game's many sidequests.
</li><li> Episode 3 has two mechas: Omega Universitas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Id Weltall</a></span> and Erde Kaiser Sigma. The latter is the only mecha in the game who's fought without the use of E.S.s.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>
<ul><li> Five bonus bosses that are above the player's maximum possible level of 99 start to wander around the world after a certain point in the story: Final Marcus at 100, Ancient Daedala at 105, Despotic Arsene at 108, Blizzard Belgazas at 114, and Avalanche Abaasy at 120. Defeating them requires careful management of stat-boosting gems and the team's tactics in general.
</li><li> One long sidequest chain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidequestSidestory">with its own story</a> that covers almost half of the game leads to a bonus boss. Though this one is not overleved, it stands out because the quests that lead to it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever</a>, the battle is under a tune only reserved for a few select <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fights</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the boss is one of the NPCs involved in the sidequest chain: Bana, the Nopon Kingpin.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>, much like its predecessor, has numerous tyrants that breach the level cap of 60.
<ul><li> The most powerful Tyrant is the level 99 monster Telethia, the Endbringer. It's first shown in a cutscene near the end of Chapter 6, and is later challenged in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a> fight in an Affinity mission ("The Nopon Heir"). The real battle comes during the normal mission "A Fateful Choice".
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Neilnail Albus and Neilnail Furvus</a>, a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Skells</a> fought in the 'Twin Dolls of Mystery' Time Attack mission. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">They were originally supposed to be a story boss, but that plot thread was scrapped.</a>
</li><li> The Global Nemeses, Telethia Plume and Yggralith Zero, put an interesting spin on this. They appear on the online mission list when a certain amount of multiplayer tasks have been completed, but instead of beating them, you're supposed to just deal as much damage as possible to them within 8 minutes (or until you die three times). This takes away from an absolutely <strong>massive</strong> healthpool shared across every player meaning thousands of players need to work together over the course of about a real time week to actually kill either of them.
</li><li> Completing the game adds five powerful Tyrants to the world: Dadaan, the Strongest Prone, who summons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">his squad</a> and will scrap your Skell with his bazooka if you try to use one against him; Lugalbanda, the Wanderer-King, which can debilitate you with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> and summon ovis to eat for healing; Gradivus, the Headless Emperor, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change Boss</a> millesaur with a permanently destroyed neck and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">100 million HP</a></em>; Leva'el, the Terminus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar">Xern</a> that summons squads of enemy Skells and Satellis units and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> attack; and Nardacyon, the Shadowless, a souped-up version of the Chapter 7 boss and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> extraordinaire that is summoned if you try to fight its pilot Nahum, the Red Hare while you're in a Skell. Some of these Tyrants drop unique weapons or special augments that add reflect effects to certain auras and Overdrives, and most of them drop unique holofigures.
</li><li> Also found in the postgame are several non-Tyrant mission bosses at or over level 60, such as Blood Despair, the Gleaming Sphinxes, Ozuchi Caladar, and Nopopon Incarnate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> keeps up the tradition with eight bonus bosses over level 99, all but two of which appear only during the final chapter: Gladiator Orion at 100, Reeking Douglas at 104, Pernicious Benf at 109, Cloud Sea King Ken at 110, Mk. VII Arek at 114, Artifice Ophion at 117, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Chickenheart Dagmara</a> at 120, and Tyrannotitan Kurodil at level 130.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia">Legend of Legaia</a></em> has Lapis, who has insane attack power and can incapacitate a party member with a string of vicious attacks that deal upwards of 200% of the character's HP. Beating this boss requires either a lot of luck, hours of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, or using a very specific accessory setup. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36rxy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note36rxy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36rxy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, equipping the Luminous Jewel accessory. Since Lapis's attacks are Light elemental (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">The game does not mention this.</a>), using this accessory cuts his damage output in half and makes his attacks survivable.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SailorMoonAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SailorMoonAnotherStory">Sailor Moon: Another Story</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Esmeraude in the fourth chapter</span>. Beating said boss gets you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a second Red Pupil</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance">Marvel: Avengers Alliance</a></em> has the Epic Bosses in certain missions, which only show up if you fight every battle and complete every deploy (which often require spending rare Command Points to recruit specific heroes) in that mission. The bosses offer stronger weapons and gadgets and higher chances of winning more Command Points as prizes for defeating them, compared to normal bosses.
</li><li> Even an RPG that is stripped down to its bare mechanics also has one. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parameters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parameters">Parameters</a></em> has the bottom rectangle (previously the second-strongest enemy in the game), which turns into a 9999 hp opponent with high defence and attack after beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. Thankfully, it isn't really <em>that</em> difficult so long as you have enough life regeneration, but it does get tedious as it regenerates health quickly and can take a ton of punishment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:

<ul><li> Due to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> nature, naturally, anyone in the game can be fought and killed. But special mention has to go to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Vivec</a></span>. You are by no means required to fight him, and doing so before completing the main quest will make the normal method of beating the game impossible, but if you choose to do so, you'll have quite the fight on your hands. Bonus irony points if you soul trap him in Azura's Star. This is actually recommended, since he has the second most powerful soul for enchanting in the game, after only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Almalexia</span>.
</li><li> The Ash Vampires. You are only required to fight one in order to get an item (Sunder) off of him, but there are 6 others you can hunt down and kill. Killing them is supposed to weaken Dagoth Ur in the final confrontation, but due to a scripting glitch, this does not happen (and if it <em>did</em> happen killing all of them would break the game, as Dagoth Ur <em>would be dead before you arrive</em> leaving you unable to get the result that's supposed to happen when you kill him). Still, they each possess unique enchanted items that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">unobtainable</a> if you don't fight them, and you should kill them if you're going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.

<ul><li> Erandur-Vangaril (a lich). He can only be found in a specific cave that none of the game's quests lead you to, and can only be fought there once your character reaches a certain level.
</li><li> The giant slaughterfish, who shows up in one of the dungeons you explore in the Thieves Guild questline, but chances are you won't ever see this one if you don't fully explore the place.
</li><li> There's also the Uderfrykte Matron at Dive Rock.

<ul><li> The Ebony Warrior of the Dragonborn DLC challenges the player once they reach level 80 in the hope that he's finally met someone tough enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingLeftToDoButDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingLeftToDoButDie">kill him</a>. His equipment is heavily enchanted, has 50% damage resistance to all elements, is immune to several spells and Shouts, and can use Dragon Shouts in addition to healing spells and potions. There are also a few named dragons which are not required to be fought. Of particular note is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Vulthoryol, who can be summoned by using the Unrelenting Force shout on the orange globe in Blackreach.</span>
</li><li> Also in Dragonborn, the player has the option to fight the ghost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyBossBattle">Kaarstag</a>, a Frost Giant that was killed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nerevarine</a> in Morrowind's Bloodmoon DLC. The player must find his skull and place it on his throne if they wish to challenge him, and after defeating him they gain the ability to summon him in battle three times only.
</li><li> The Dawnguard DLC adds the Reaper, a ghostly headsman that can be fought in the Soul Cairn after finding three gem fragments.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A lot of bosses in any of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> games will be this trope.

Defeating Zelgius is all that you have to do to beat the level, and the rest of your troops don't even have to move, let alone fight Levail (who as a top level Sentinel equipped with the Wishblade is one of the few genuine threats you'll meet in the last quarter of the game). Many choose to engage him though, out of the desire to kill a few more opponents and maybe get their hands on the Wishblade.

<ul><li> Demon Supreme Overlord Baal in the <em>Marl Kingdom</em> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle">La Pucelle</a> Tactics</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, and <em>Disgaea 2</em>. In fact, most Nippon Ichi games let you fight characters from their other games as bonus bosses, and they're always at obscene levels. Laharl, Etna, and Flonne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</a></em> are all Bonus Bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, for example. In many cases, defeating them will recruit them into your party. While the final bosses of the games tend to be at level 90-100, the bonus ones usually start somewhere around level <em>1000.</em> That's <em>start</em> mind you. In "Etna Mode" of the new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea</a></em> PSP remake, Baal is level 9999. Special mention should go to his Disgaea 3 DLC. Max level, three copies of his Tyrant form (as shown in the page image), well over 400 million HP, and an evility that nulls out damage each round based on how many copies of himself there are on the field. If you don't act quickly enough, the enemy base panels in the back will summon more Baal copies. If you're still too slow, they'll start bringing out Omega Sentinels for the Baal clones to Magichange with. Either you finish it quickly, or otherwise you're screwed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>. The final story boss of the game is often one of the absolute weakest enemies the game has to offer. Disgaea 2 had, alone, Overlord Priere at level 500, Marjoly at 1000, Overlord Zenon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(the real one)</span> at level 2000, Overlord Baal (the first round) at level 4000, and you still have quite a lot of others. The re-release (mentioned below) also added the DLC characters whom are easy to beat but all sit at 100, and three characters form Disgaea 3 starting at level 500 and ending at level 3500. Additionally, the final boss of Disgaea 2 is level 90 and has no geo effects on the field and is alone. The bonus bosses are often not that gracious, and may have backup, geo effects, and ridiculous levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em> and The re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em> brought back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> Pringer X as a Bonus Boss, and he's more dangerous than Baal up there for a good reason: he can become immune to any special that's already been used against him, meaning you can't spam the same attack over and over, you HAVE to round out your move set. Later on, you get the chance to fight <em>Eight</em> of them, and they will all become immune to any special used against one of them, but that's not all: You can later pass a bill that turns all of the Land of Carnage monsters from Uber to Uber Lord, making them not only stronger, but you can't capture them and the bill sticks for that cycle. If you go back to take on Pringer X's army again, their stats are maxed out at 40 million, meaning damaging them is a daunting task in and of itself, much less hitting them. They return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten">Disgaea 4</a></em> as the final bonus boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2">Disgaea Dimension 2</a></em> has an incarnation of Baal that is at the moment, the absolute hardest boss NIS has ever made. Most of the examples of this trope in their games can be taken down easily if the player level grinds enough, but Baal in this game, even characters with maxed stats will struggle with him. He never loses a stationary attack bonus, so his damage goes up every turn, switches between some abilities throughout the fight that include summoning clones of him every turn that will rack a ton of damage if you don't kill them, having 50% of all attacks miss, and destroying you base panel and healing himself at the end of ever turn, but throughout the whole fight has Pringer X's ability to become immune to special attacks after they're used on him (though he loses immunity to attacks he was hit with previously when he changes evilities). He has so much HP that it's a requirement to raise the stationary attack bonus as high as possible to take him down and even then he's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a>.
</li><li> Tyrant Overlord Baal in D2 goes above and beyond the call of duty as a boss. It's not just the boss fight itself that's a marathon. It's preparing for the fight that is an Iron Triathalon itself. Getting the levels and stats of your characters, weapons, and gear high enough to fight him and have a chance at winning can take dozens upon dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay. Strap yourself in, tighten up that sphincter, and notify your loved ones that you might be unavailable for a while, as you can end up dedicating days or even weeks on end to just preparing for this boss fight.

This includes battles with the SILENT in the minds of Honoka, Sakai and even Mint the ghost cat.

<ul><li> Both bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> are optional. The first is the Enderdragon, which doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. The second, more traditional example, is the Wither, which has to be summoned by completing a difficult task, is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">insanely</a></em> hard, and drops the Nether Star, which can only be used in constructing Beacons, devices which give you bonus abilities.
</li><li> By the same token, nothing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> says you <em>have</em> to find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Hidden Fun Stuff</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">the Vaults</a>, for that matter, if you're an Adventurer instead. Both will give you utter hell even by the game's standards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> King Slime's main purpose is giving the cosmetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">Ninja armor</a> (he can drop a slime mount and on Expert gives the useful Royal Gel that turns all slimes neutral). He can appear randomly in the outer parts of the map, but killing him is never required to progress through the game.
</li><li> Queen Bee unlocks the non-essential Witch Doctor NPC and has good low-level gear, but is otherwise optional.
</li><li> Duke Fishron could be about as challenging as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> and drops a lot of good stuff, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">comparatively hard to summon</a> and doesn't advance the world at all.
</li><li> The Empress of Light is an optional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> boss with tougher stats than even Duke Fishron, but good drops. She has a special drop that can only be obtained if all damage to her is done during the day, during which all of her attacks kill the player with one hit.
</li><li> The optional Pumpkin and Frost Moons both have at least two bosses that have a higher chance of dropping good weapons the more waves the player fights through. Their most dangerous bosses are the Pumpking and the Ice Queen, respectively, which by themselves already have stats on par with the regular Hardmode bosses, but later waves have the payer fighting multiples of them at once.
</li><li> The Old One's Army is an optional crossover event themed on tower defense. Its third and most difficult tier ends with with fighting Betsy, a giant fire-breathing dragon who could prove to be difficult to take on even with endgame-tier equipment. She must be fought while <em>also</em> dealing with the enemies from previous waves.
