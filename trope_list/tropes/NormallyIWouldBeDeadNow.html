For example, if a character gets shot in the head or stabbed in the chest, they're pretty much done for, hopefully with enough time to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a> before their death.
</p><p>Unless of course, they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">extremely tough</a>. For them, that little hole where their heart was supposed to be is just another chance to show off how badass they are. Even that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>, and the guy that injured them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">likely to be pissing in his pants right now</a>, is about to receive a world of hurt. When this occurs in a climactic battle, you often see a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a> sequence.
</p><p>Killing the character after their display of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> for extra dramatic effect, or to show that the wounds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime">were fatal after all, just not right away</a>, is optional.

If it is "merely" something like severe bleeding from the shoulder or leg, that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>. Surprisingly, this is actually a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. There are many real-life examples of people who had things rammed through their chests and heads and still lived due to the foreign material miraculously missing vital organs. This means there is a fine line between this and mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aversion">aversion</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">Instant Death Bullet</a>. However, it is far more common in fiction than in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> and all of them were left incapacitated or unable to move, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>.

<ul><li> Vita of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> was stabbed back to front, but still continued to fight in the final battle despite a gaping chest wound. Nanoha also gets badly injured. In both cases, they continue in large part because of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> natures.
<ul><li> Though Vita is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a>, and consequently much tougher than a human, but that was a very serious injury even for her.
</li></ul></li><li> Kamina of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes a laser up his chest, visibly tearing his body, and his mech, nearly in two, then gets stabbed in the back with a laser spear, and then gets hit with his own swords/sunglasses. However, he manages to pull himself up, throws his own mech's arm at Simon, delivers a hotblooded speech from hell out, kills <em>an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a></em>, catches the same laser that injured him earlier, then proceeds to string the guy up on his mech's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">freakin' sunglasses</a> and then shoves a drill through him that'd make any dentist cringe. All while bleeding out on the floor. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Wow.</a></em></span>
<ul><li> The manga adaptation takes this scene and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">makes what's only implied in the above scene explicit, and therefore a subversion. He <em>was actually dead</em>, but used Spiral Power to sustain himself and continue the fight. Even more wow.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lordgenome</a> survives after getting a massive hole blown in his chest long enough to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a>. This is normally not enough to qualify, as he does not keep fighting afterward, but you have to wonder how he managed to talk for so long with no lungs left. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Anti-Spiral does pretty much the same, but shorter and it's a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> anyway.</span>
<ul><li> After his death, Roshiu took his head and stuffed it in a jar, and somehow connect him to a supercomputer. Somehow, he's flawlessly connected, despite nobody else knowing about it, and Roshiu being about as smart with technology as the average member of Team Dai-Gurren.
</li><li> It's implied that he had Leeron helping out.
</li></ul></li><li> And in a much lower-key (for Gurren-Lagann) example, Nia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hung on for a <em>week</em> after every other Anti-Spiral construct's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a>, on sheer willpower.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Nuriko of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> was also stabbed through the chest. This didn't slow him down too much, as he proceeded to snap the neck of his opponent and lift the boulder blocking the cave containing the Shinzaho of Genbu. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he died.</span>
</li><li> Neji Hyuga from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> was shot through the chest <em>twice</em> in the Sasuke retrieval arc, but still managed to kill his opponent with his ultimate technique before he collapsed. This was because he was able to deflect the first arrow away from his vital organs at the last moment, and thwarted the second by turning around. Even so, the resulting wounds would have been fatal if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a> hadn't arrived in time.
<ul><li> Other examples were Zabuza (who is the page picture here), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsunade, and Jiraiya</span>. All were fatally stabbed but, through sheer willpower, managed to stay alive long enough to finish what they were doing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsunade</span> even managed to put her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> into action and regenerate, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jiraiya</span> was stabbed deeply and <em>multiple times</em> by a weapon that's able to paralyze people and his opponent thought he already heard his heart stop before he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">spontaneously</a> regained consciousness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danzou</span> stays alive enough time to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> attempt against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tobi and Sasuke. It doesn't work</span>.
</li><li> Tsunade managed to one-up herself at the conclusion of her fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madara</span> when she was literally <em>torn in half</em>. Despite that, she still managed to summon up slugs to keep her and the other Kages alive until she could be put back together.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mustang</span> has one of these moments in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a>. After having been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>impaled</em> by Lust</span>, he gets back up, performs first aid on himself and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Havoc</span> via alchemy, then tracks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lust</span> down and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>burns her to death over and over</em></span> before finally collapsing, but retaining consciousness. His earlier comment to an unconscious <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Havoc</span> while they are both lying on the floor bleeding out - "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Havoc</span>, I won't let you die before me!" - indicates that he basically hauled himself back from the brink by sheer force of will because he refused to allow any of the people he was with to die if he could help it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aizen once mentions Ichigo's resolve to live is so great even lethal wounds simply render him unable to move instead of killing him. When a massive hole is blasted in his chest, he very nearly dies until mysteriously resurrected and healed by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">inner hollow</a>.
</li><li> When Rukia's understanding of her own power develops, she explains that her body's temperature drops below a level capable of sustaining life. She remains alive by using her reiatsu to put her cells into a form of stasis and puppeteer her effectively dead body. Returning to her normal body temperature after using her power is so fraught with danger that using her power means she runs the risk of potentially killing herself by accident should she misstep even slightly.
</li></ul></li><li> Spike Spiegel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> took multiple bullets while getting to the final fight against Vicious. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually died of those injuries and ones caused by Vicious. Maybe.</span>
<ul><li> What else has happened to him? In "Ballad of Fallen Angels", he got slashed in the face and thrown out a building. In "Jupiter Jazz Part 1", he got shot in the chest once and fell unconscious. He should have bled out but didn't. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, he got beat down, shot and thrown out a <em>moving monorail hovering above the water</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Negi of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> manga puts up an admirable fight despite being <em>impaled in the chest</em> by a thick piece of stone, pulling out and gripping the stone in one hand and sucker-punching his opponent with it. He collapses again soon afterward because it <em>is</em> a fatal injury, but it's enough of a distraction that a team effort from the others manages to turn things around enough to recover their gear and heal him.
<ul><li> Later, during his match with Rakan, he's turned into pulp by a point-blank physical attack that could kill a dragon and mostly ignored his barriers. In the process of struggling to his feet, he begins puking more blood than his body should probably be able to hold. Rakan tells him to stay down or he might die, but then subtly taunts him so that he <em>won't</em> and they can finish their match.
</li></ul></li><li> Yuki Nagato of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> takes four massive spear-like projectiles through the torso, then proceeds to kill the culprit — her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValleyGirl">understudy</a> — without so much as a cry of pain or raised voice. Like Vita above, though, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Network Terminal</a>, but as she still bleeds and breathes, this had to have been pretty significant damage. She collapses afterward. Well, first she takes <a class="urllink" href="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/9526/yukispeard.jpg">several iron spears to the chest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (and pulls one out of her and <em>turns it into a desk</em>). Then she gets hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Ryoko's giant energy tentacles</a>, either through the upper torso or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingMoments">through</a> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">head</a></em>.
</li><li> Kazuki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> uses this to his advantage to defend against his opponent, a kendo genius whose signature (and vaguely illegal) move involves a devastating wide strike to the ribs. When Kazuki fights him, he's using a katana, and to avoid being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sliced in half, Kazuki returns his weapon to its passive state where it functions as his heart, actually blocking</span> the strike.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, Jonathan Joestar's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">final</span> battle with Dio Brando incorporates this trope, as it starts out with him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting two dime-sized holes blasted through his neck, including one right in the jugular</span>. Additionally, this occurs several times during the battle between Jotaro and Dio in Stardust Crusaders, most notably when Dio famously drops a steamroller on Jotaro, whose Stand frantically attempts to keep it off of him while Dio's stand (which is faster and stronger) presses it down on him, pummeling the steam roller so hard that Jotaro <em>can feel his blows through the steam roller itself as if it weren't there</em>. To complicate things, Dio <em>stops time</em> before dropping the steam roller, and Jotaro can only move for two seconds, whereas Dio pounds on him for a solid nine. After the steam roller is completely crushed, Dio gloats over his assumed victory, knowing that not even Jotaro could have survived the assault. When he finishes his evil monologue, he notices that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he cannot move, because Jotaro stopped time himself at the nine-second mark, escaping from under the steam roller while Dio was gloating and assuming that the extended time stop duration was proof of his increasing power</span>. Jotaro then proceeds to beat the carp (yes, the carp) out of him.
<ul><li> <em>Jojo</em> is generally made of this trope, including a <em>self-inflicted</em> occurrence by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bucciarati in Golden Wind</span> to trick an opponent. <em>Steel Ball Run</em> has a doozy; Johnny is shot in the head by Ringo Roadagain and survives.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>, a youma holds Raki hostage in order to force Clare to throw away her sword. She throws it some ways downhill, and the youma proceeds to impale her with its claws. Except then Clare grabs its arm, dives down the hill dragging it with her, retrieves her sword, and promptly kills it. It would not be fatal to a Claymore, who can self-regenerate. Also, Ophelia had her neck twisted and didn't die.
</li><li> The wolves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> are pretty tenacious, often fighting like crazy despite severe wounds. The (posthumous) prize must go to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Toboe</span>, who keeps on fighting even after being shot in the chest at point-blank range. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">And then dies.</a>
<ul><li> Kiba is even more dramatic. He has been practically torn to pieces and <em>still</em> got up and continued fighting. You <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">just can't stop him</a>!

One of his students is kidnapped, and he goes in pursuit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While saving the female student from a very dark situation, he is shot three times.</span> He manages to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">make it back to the testing station, finish the test, and get a passing grade while bleeding profusely</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> loves this trope, the fact that any of the girls survive 'til the end is an absolute miracle (In fairness, more than a few times they do actually die and get revived with the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>). However, there are some times they should die but don't. Doesn't even slow them down really. Most notable in the climax of Season Three when the title character jumps into the equivalent of an atomic bomb, and still comes out alive)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a></em>, having already been badly wounded by Witch cultists, Rem is seemingly finished off by a single spell from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Betelgeuse</a>, who then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">twists and contorts her limbs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just for the sheer hell of it</a>. Betelgeuse is in no doubt that she's dead, but after he and the other cultists have left, Rem somehow manages to crawl over to Subaru on her shattered limbs and break his shackles with her magic before finally dying in Subaru's arms. Luckily for Rem, her death is undone when Subaru himself is killed a few minutes later, causing time to rewind.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the greatest example has to be Roronoa Zoro. This man according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> lost what amounted to <em>five liters</em> of blood fighting Hatchan, mostly due to an earlier wound given by the greatest swordsman in the world, Dracule Mihawk, who stabbed him <em>in his heart</em> and <em>slashed him across the chest</em>, permanently scarring him just to finish him off. Mihawk seemed to sense he was badass enough to survive by asking him to surpass him and challenge him again.
<ul><li> Zoro also fought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Mr. 1</a>, an assassin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a> formerly known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Daz Bones</a>, who during the fight turned his arms into buzzsaws and <em>drove them into his chest</em>.
</li><li> Perhaps the greatest example is when Bartholomew Kuma, a designated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> (known to do psycho things, but now calm and now loyal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a>) pushed all the pain and fatigue away from Monkey D. Luffy's body from his battle with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and Zoro who himself took some punishment from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">zombie giant</a> Oz, and Kuma's shockwave, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">took all the pain in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">and survived</a></em>. When asked by Sanji what happened to him, he replied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">"Nothing. Nothing at all."</a>
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on Zoro's case when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">self-proclaimed god</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro">Eneru</a> blasted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">a large column of lightning</a> through an upper level of Giant Jack and Zoro, Wiper, Chopper, and the giant snake came crashing with massive debris, no less. As he crashed on the ground, he pushed a giant rock away from his body and yelled "Damn rock! I could have died!" Nico Robin agreed.
</li><li> Even Luffy falls into this trope. His match duel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Crocodile who is fond of giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plans</a> and more so of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulettes</a>, ended with the former being impaled by the latter's pirate hook. And even then, he didn't die and had enough strength to grab his arm, so Crocodile threw him in quicksand to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead">leave him for dead</a>. Luffy <em>still</em> had enough strength to pop his head out of the sand. With help from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Nico Robin</a>, who helped him out of the sand, and Pell who fed him, Luffy returned to fight Crocodile who sucked the water out of him. And in their next confrontation (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Luffy just doesn't give up, does he?</a>), even Crocodile gave some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on what he went through. And even after being poisoned, he still managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">knock Crocodile through pure bedrock in the underground chamber, launching him above Alubarna flying in the air until he landed in the town centre.</a>
<ul><li> Luffy displays this trope an awful lot, beginning with Crocodile and steadily escalating. His fight with Rob Lucci ends with Luffy unable to stand and having been trashed so soundly Lucci thinks that he must surely be dead. Later during his rampage through Impel Down he gets poisoned by Warden Magelen (a death sentence in itself) but still has the strength to drag Bon Clay through the arctic conditions of level 5 and beg Ivankov to heal Bon Clay first. After completing his gruesome healing procedure in less than a day he continues fighting and Ivankov constantly lampshades that the only thing keeping Luffy going is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">unstoppable will</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Oda seems to adore this trope because at least one character per arc seems to fit this trope. The first is Dolton from the Drum arc, who was hit by arrows and then frozen over. To be fair, he got medical attention really fast. Kohza from the Alabasta arc got it even worse when he got shot in the chest a grand total of five times, and he still was totally fine a few days later. However, the character who takes the cake for this trope, by far, is Wiper from Skypeia. He got stabbed in the shoulder, Axe Dialed to the back and electrocuted at least twice. If that weren't enough already, he uses a kamikaze move, his Reject Dial, three times, even though every time someone tells him that he'll die if he uses it! The bones in his arm were pretty much shattered. After all this, you would think he'd be down for the count, but no! He can still get up later that evening! All he needed was a bunch of bandages.
</li><li> If this example isn't first for <em>One Piece</em>, then it's a pretty close second. During the Whitebeard War Arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whitebeard</span> took a grand total of 267 slashes and stabs, 152 bullets, 46 cannonballs, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half his goddamned face being melted off</span>. And this is after laying down a well-deserved beat down on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blackbeard</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hiro Mashima <em>loves</em> this trope. Honestly, after reading a few volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> you'll realize that you can never be sure—no matter how much pounding, shooting, blasting, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">Explosive Overclocking</a> a character gets—whether they're seriously dead/about to die or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a>. Plue can stop bleeding and pain. But it does not explain Shuda surviving the loss of a limb and a 1000 foot fall, or Lucia being up and murderous after his beating from Haru, or the numerous times Sieg is kicking ass again after having a vital organ severely damaged.
</li><li> Hiro Mashima's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> - There's also no explanation for how Gray took <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">being impaled</a></em> <strong>through his stomach</strong> without even slowing down while fighting Lyon. In fact, all he apparently did to treat the wound was <em>sealing it with ice</em> (a seal which broke before the end of the fight), leaving no explanation for why he did not lose two or three vital organs. Just to makes this even more ridiculous, he then fights better against his opponent than he ever did uninjured and starts by beating the hell out of him with just his fists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> - Poor Tsukune suffers from this pretty badly, especially after he gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his vampire powers</span>. At one point he's hit in the head so hard it <em>bounces off the pavement</em>, yet he's none the worse for wear. He does have a keepsake of his abuse; two big scars that reach across his chest, forming an X.
<ul><li> He was also burned to a husk (while still human) by a four-tailed yoko. Ouch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And it looks like he's about to have it happen again.</span>

Sasuke comments mildly that this would kill a normal man. Yukimura, however, comes running right back into Shingen's fist so he can do it all over again, although he's in a slightly rotated position when he hits the wall the second time.
</li><li> Sven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> survives being stabbed through the chest by Eve's mutated knife-arm, because it "Eve intentionally avoided his vital organs", although it is unclear how a knife a little over half the size of his entire chest could avoid anything.
</li><li> Itou Komataro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> was shot repeatedly, lost an arm, got a lot of sword wounds but hey, he died... eventually... after three episodes to which he was given an honorable death of being given the chance to defend himself from the Shinsengumi.

But his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> drive keeps him going long after he should have been knocked out cold.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em>: Seriously, Issei has been subjected with this trope so many times in his entire life. If he didn't accept that flier from one of Rias' familiars, he'd be dead already before the novels even started. And that's just <em>the first case of this trope happening.</em>
</li><li> Occurred on a number of occasions throughout the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. If you count reaching 0 Life Points as dead...
<ul><li> The first instances were in the Doma Arc of the Original series. The Pharaoh is dueling against the Big Bad of the arc, Dartz. In the latter stages of the duel Pharaoh manages to destroy all Dartz' cards, in response, Dartz summons out his strongest beast, the Divine Serpent Geh, who has infinite attack and defense power. However, the cost to summon him is to pay all of Dartz' Life Points, meaning he should have lost. However, while Geh is in play, he cannot lose by any means. Pharaoh then one-ups him by playing the card <em>Relay Soul</em> which grants the same clause to a monster in his hand which he can then summon. Now both players are out of Life Points and would normally be out of the duel.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a> Kalin pulls a similar move in the Crash Town finale. After goading his opponent into hitting him with enough effect damage to wipe him out on the first turn, he reveals the effect of his <em>Infernity Zero</em> monster; namely, it is unaffected by all other effects except itself and cannot be destroyed in battle. Also, while it is face-up on the field, its controller cannot lose the duel, even if their Life Points are depleted. However, for each multiple of 500 damage he would take, <em>Zero</em> gains a Doom Counter; when the count reaches 3, <em>Zero</em> self destructs.

He's been shot, stabbed, blown up and hammered with enough physical trauma to kill any normal man. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightOfTheOwls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NightOfTheOwls">Night of the Owls</a></em>, he was stabbed about eight or nine times by a member of the Court of Owls, pitched off a building, and trapped in an isolated maze for god knows how long. He was a little squirrelly afterwards, but He Got Better. Not really a comic reference, but watch the two promo videos for DC Universe Online that shows him take a missile to the face, and return in the second one as one of the three remaining superheroes on earth. Ironically, it lends Lex Luthor's cockroach analogy slightly wrong...

Instead of resigning himself to fate, he put his inventive genius to work — rigging up an electromagnetic pacemaker to keep his heart beating and keep the shrapnel out.

He then keeps talking about how much it hurt in spite of his being a robot, implying that the wound was rather severe, then drove a semi truck off of a <em>twelve-mile-high cliff</em> — and he and the truck <em>survived</em>. In fact, he drove the truck <em>several miles</em> through the desert after hitting the ground. Given that the main premise of the comics is that he's avoiding self-destruction (his model self-destructs after killing its intended target, so he instead incapacitates it and puts it in stasis, becoming a hit man to pay its hospital bills), it's strange such a thing would even be possible.

At one point, he gets shot in the side of his chest, point-blank, with a shotgun. After acknowledging that one of his ribs is "...gone. Not broken, gone.", he gets into an extended fistfight with the man who shot him, tosses him out of a window, and carries on. It seems like you can't finish a story arc without Castle experiencing some near-fatal damage.

We see that that impaling a Slayer does little to stop them. <br/><br/>There is also Xander, who survived after being smacked around with a hammer that injures deities.

The Doctor is summoned and observes in fascination as the customer continues to babble half-coherently despite the bullet going straight through his head (demonstrated after he dies by sticking a metal probe straight through the wound channel.) The customer does die after some minutes, but even the Doctor seemed to think he should be dead, or at least not babbling.

The final cause of death? Hypothermia: the autopsy showed that <em>there was no water in his lungs at the time of death.</em> Tenacious isn't the word. After the February Revolution, the new government dug up his body and burned it, just to be sure he was <em>really</em> gone.
<ul><li> He even sat up during the burning <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3zgo4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3zgo4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3zgo4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though this was likely caused by failure to sever his tendons before burning... the heat made them shrink and pull him into a sitting position</span>.
</li><li> Incidentally, the reason Rasputin didn't eat sweets was because of a condition stemming from a previous assassination attempt, in which he had his belly slit open so that his <em>entrails hung out</em> (a.k.a disembowelment). Also, a working girl was hired to try to take some overzealous nibbles while working down below.
</li><li> Rasputin purportedly practiced Mithridatism, which is the practice of taking small non-lethal amounts of poison in order to build an immunity to that poison over time, which might be the reason why Rasputin supposedly ingested five times the minimum amount of cyanide required to kill a normal man. Since his assassins did not know of his Mithridatism, this might explain their impatience with him not dying and going loud after a while.
</li><li> A good deal of the story was likely made up by the assassins to demonize Rasputin further and make themselves appear vindicated. An unpublished autopsy performed in 1916 and reviewed in 1993 and 2004/5 found no poison in his stomach but determined that the third bullet wound (directly to the forehead) killed him instantly. The culprit? Lt. Oswald Rayner, an Englishman. The bullet was the only unjacketed round found in Rasputin's body, and the only gun that fired unjacketed rounds and was present at Rasputin's murder was a Webley .445 inch revolver, owned (and most likely fired) by Lt. Rayner. That said, three rounds and numerous bladed weapon wounds is still a lot to kill a man.
<ul><li> Although there is a possibility that the poison was destroyed when the food was baked <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4pc15');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4pc15" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4pc15');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was supposedly a cake</span>.

He continued to give orders to his men until he died hours later.
</li><li> During one battle in World War II's Pacific Theater, the medics doing triage at the field hospital came across a soldier with an entrance wound in his forehead and an exit wound at the back of his head.

Armand Bacquer was a French policeman in Paris, caught by Germans the day Paris was liberated, he was promptly shot at nightfall, and survived all night until a passer-by called the Red Cross. His most important wound was in the left lung which is usually very fatal. He limped for the rest of his life, having been also shot four times in the right leg. He recovered slowly and lived until 2005. He was 24 at the time of his execution.

</li><li> Similar to the Marine story mentioned above, a man was robbing a small town bank when, through pure coincidence, one of the tellers happened to be a former classmate who recognized him. Now needing to eliminate the witnesses, the crook took them to a back room and executed them each with a shot in the back of the head with a large-calibre handgun. Except, again coincidentally, for the woman who knew him: the bullet traveled around her skull and out the forehead, knocking her unconscious and (like all head wounds) causing so much blood that he assumed she was dead. She testified at his trial. <br/><br/>Getting shot in the head and having the bullet not penetrate is surprisingly common, even with modern firearms. Given the strength and roundness of a skull, bullets can skip off or pull the "run under the scalp" thing described above. Of course, more powerful rounds are less likely to fail to penetrate.

</li><li> Army dentist Dr. AnnaLee Kruyer came back from Iraq with the story of an anonymous sergeant who was shot in the face in the exact right spot for all of the bullet's energy to be transferred to one of his teeth, ejecting it from its socket and stopping the bullet there.

</li><li> Theodore Roosevelt was shot in the chest by an assassin and took the time to finish his speech before he sought medical attention. He was helped a bit by the bullet being partially stopped by his glasses and the thick, folded speech being held <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector">in his breast pocket,</a> preventing the round from piercing his lung. He also willed himself to live through a near-fatal case of malaria which ate fifty pounds off his body weight. When he finally did die, peacefully, in his sleep, one contemporary said, "Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping. If he'd been awake there would have been a fight."
</li><li> On January 8th, 2011; Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head by a deranged attempted assassin. Unfortunately, six other people, including a nine-year-old child and a federal judge, were killed in the attempt, but Congresswoman Giffords survived. She returned to office on August 1st, 2011, to be met with a standing ovation, though she retired shortly thereafter due to complications from her injuries, including difficulty forming sentences because part of the brain responsible was damaged by the bullet along with partial vision loss and paralysis.
</li><li> Malala Yousafzai was a young education activist living in Taliban-controlled Pakistan. On her way home from an exam on the morning of October 9th, 2012, her bus was stopped and boarded by Taliban gunmen. Malala was shot in the head. It passed through her head and into her neck, before stopping in her shoulder. She survived with little permanent damage, and continues to be an education advocate to this day - she even won the Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy, the youngest person in history to win.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrevorNoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrevorNoah">Trevor Noah</a> in his autobiography, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BornACrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BornACrime">Born a Crime</a></em>, recalls when his mother was shot in the back of the head by her ex-husband. The bullet traveled under the scalp then exited through one of her nostrils. Trevor Noah remarked that once the blood was cleaned off his mother's face, it was clear the damage was fairly minimal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda">Niki Lauda</a> had a brush with death in 1976 when he raced in Nürburgring. He was initially reluctant due to what he saw as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">safety issues</a>, and called for a drivers' meeting to gather a consensus on whether to continue on with the race. Unfortunately for him, he himself attested to the dangers of that track the hard way, sustaining serious burns in his head and damage to his lungs from the toxic fumes he ingested from the wreckage. His injuries were so harrowing that Niki was given the Last Rites by a priest as his wife was certain that he was going to buy the farm, only for the Austrian to fight his way out his injuries and get back to the championship fight with James Hunt just <em>six weeks</em> later, all while his scars are still <em>fresh and bleeding</em>. He would have won the 1976 championship had it not for the inclement weather in the Japanese Grand Prix, not to mention the fact that his eyes were watery and had difficulty blinking due to the aforementioned injuries.
