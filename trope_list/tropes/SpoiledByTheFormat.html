</div></div><p>It's a universal but occasionally unfortunate fact that any medium has some physical realization; often, facts about that physicality can allow you to figure out things about a work earlier than the creators intend.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>For example, when reading a book, you can tell exactly how much of it there is remaining. If you're near the end, you might realize that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">end must come in a certain specific way as any other way would take too long to resolve</a>. (Ending on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> is one way to avoid this.) If you're not, you might know that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">apparent resolution can't possibly last as there's too much book left.</a> (An afterword, "Preview of the Next Book," or "Q&amp;A with the Author" feature can help avoid that.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">E-readers</a> avert both of these problems, though some of them (such as the Kindle and Nook) have either the chapters and page numbers listed (as a normal book would) or a percentage progress bar (some Kindle versions).
</p><p>Books also spoil through their page format, because a heavy reader tends to be able to read quickly enough that if they are concerned about, say, a character as they read down the left page their eyes can sometimes dart over to the right page to see what is being mentioned there. Some readers try to beat this phenomenon by placing a thick sheet of paper over the right page as they read a book for the first time, and are nearing the end of the book.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A similar phenomenon can happen for TV broadcasts due to their generally fixed length. For example, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticHourLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticHourLong">Dramatic Hour Long</a> episode, any solution to a problem that comes after 20 minutes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">will generally fail</a>, while any solution that takes 35 minutes will generally succeed. Even if your time sense is poor, you can often figure out whether the currently proposed solution is the correct one by counting commercial breaks. Similarly, mystery shows have a tendency to introduce the villain somewhere around the 15 minute mark: soon enough that they feel like an integral part of the episode, but late enough that they're not the first person you associate with the setup. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualImmortality">Contractual Immortality</a> and related tropes are another example of this in TV series: there is a clear delineation between "regular characters" and everyone else, which often spoils the suspense of whether any given character will die, get married, be promoted, etc.or else reveals a culprit's identity before the characters guess it because there's only one guest character left that it could be.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Streaming video from the web removes the fixed-length problem, but virtually every video streaming service displays how far into the video you are as a matter of convenience. The bar disappears with inactivity, but it takes just a move of the mouse (accidental or on purpose) to make it appear again. Some videos may have a blank screen for the last part to obfuscate the video's length, but there's not much of a way to make a video go longer than it appears.
</p><p>A short-term variant of this can occur when watching TV shows and movies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClosedCaptioning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClosedCaptioning">Closed Captioning</a> or subtitles, since they usually display a sentence before it's finished being said. This means that if a character's words are cut off in the middle of a sentence, you know that they're going to be interrupted by something a few seconds before it happens. In some cases, when it's obvious enough what the character is going to say next, it's possible to avoid this in subtitles by showing the whole sentence anyway, then making it quickly disappear when the character is interrupted. Some captioning includes the name of the person doing the speaking, which is especially frustrating if that person's actual identity is an important future plot point and hasn't actually been revealed yet.
</p><p>Another variant of this is when the phrase "Part 1" is in the title  you know that it must end on a cliffhanger of some kind.
</p><p>This can be a good thing depending on the work and the viewer's preference. Some works may even take advantage of this trope, using the viewer's awareness to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsTheFinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsTheFinalBattle">avoid explaining the obvious</a> or even to play with their expectations.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>, which are much the same issue applied to video games, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuouslyLightPatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuouslyLightPatch">Conspicuously Light Patch</a>, which is this trope in animation.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em>, being only six episodes long, evokes this feeling. They even lampshade it with something along the lines of:
<div class="indent"><strong>Haruko:</strong> What are you doing here? This is the climax! You need to be where the action is!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lampshaded in an episode of the anime where, after several incredibly dumb attempts to steal Pokémon, the Team Rocket trio actually tries something that might work. James wonders why they didn't start out with this plan, and Jessie replies that they needed to fill an episode.
</li><li> One of the few complaints about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins">Pokémon Origins</a></em> is that the 4-episode OVA format condensed key plot points into montages, only fleshing out other areas into full sequences (the gym battle against Brock, the Pokémon tower in Lavender Town; the battle against Giovanni, the battle against Blue; the capture of Mewtwo, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the debut of Mega Charizard X</span>).
</li><li> By that proxy, the acts of The Strongest Mega Evolution are often criticized for their pacing problems on their special format.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> you can almost always tell when Sakura is going to miss the catch, simply because her attempt is <em>actually animated</em> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>.
</li><li> At the end of the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shinji does something that triggers 3rd Impact</span>. However, you know that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 3rd Impact will be aborted</span> because there are two more movies to go. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in <em>3.0.</em>, which reveals that yes, Third Impact still happened, and most of humanity was wiped out as a result.</span>
</li><li> Anime tends to come in rough multiples of 12- or 13-episode chunks. If you don't know going in that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> has an irregular number of episodes, this could be an issue.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, wherein Kagami and her family are watching an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">unnamed suspenseful reality game show involving a million yen up for grabs</a> and Tsukasa can't stand the suspense so she glances at the clock; with only a few minutes left in the hour-long program, and Japanese Game Shows almost always avoid cliff-hangers, she knows the person got a question wrong. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Kagami, predictably, notices this and berates her for it.</a>
</li><li> Manga volumes in general tend to spoil themselves. When the chapters are published in magazines monthly, the tension can build, and people can wonder if their favorite characters will survive, or if the plot will be resolved. When a certain number of collected volumes have been published, even in arc-based works, it can be obvious that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a> hasn't yet been resolved, or a main cast member hasn't died yet.
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto">Pluto</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Gesicht, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">the main character</a>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> there's still two volumes left to go.</span> Although anyone familiar with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> story Pluto is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">would already know this</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, over the course of the 20-volume run, the main characters get a manga launched about a quarter of the way through, and seem ready to get an anime a little over halfway through- the latter is what Mashiro hopes to get in order to fulfill his promise to Azuki, the girl he loves. It's not hard to figure out that neither case pans out for the protagonists if you know how long the series is, although it is somewhat surprising to see what happens.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KindaichiCaseFiles">Kindaichi Case Files</a></em>, the case will usually be solved whenever this catchphrase "All the mysteries have been solved" or "The culrpit is one of us!" are said by one character in an overly dramatic fashion, usually taking almost one page. That's why when someone delivers a plausible solution not followed by those, you can tell it's not the correct one, especially when there are 3-4 more chapters to go.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> The back of the published manga can cause this in two different ways since it features the top 10 of the of the 104th trainee corps. If you've read the first volume or seen enough episodes, you can figure this out easily, and the fact that they're in order from 1-10 going left to right helps. On the back of volume two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eren, the fifth from the left, is transparent, which one would assume is to show that he was killed in book 1; but if you look at the later books, he goes back to being solid white, which means that he gets better in book 2</span>.
</li><li> This happens again with the cover of Volume 14, which prominently shows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Erwin has lost his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">right</a> arm</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> When all of the remaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monsters of the Week</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero">Yuki Yuna is a Hero</a></em> decide to attack all at once, precisely nobody believed that the show was over, because they were defeated in Episode 5 of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime">12-Episode Anime</a>. This makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">following two episodes</a> an exercise in waiting for the other shoe to drop. Sure enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Heroes still have to deal with one straggler</span>, but even then, the series is only two-thirds of the way done... and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> happens. This trope is probably the main reason why so many fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">correctly guessed</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Taisha is lying about the disabilities from Mankai being temporary</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <em>Nobita's Great Adventure into the Underworld</em> involves the characters creating a parallel universe where magic exists. Unfortunately said parallel world turned out to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> demon who wanted to take over the Earth. The solution? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">Just go back to their own universe.</a> In the comic it has a fake ending but of course it doesn't work since people will notice a suspiciously large amount of book left.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> chapter 536 ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a> defeated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Acnologia</a> sealed away in a dimension beyond time.</span> This would seem like the end of the series... Except the same chapter revealed that there are ten more chapters left in the series, making it clear that something is going to go wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a>'s</em> second ending, "Keep On", showcases all eight of the original Chosen Children/DigiDestined and their respective partners' forms.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Fan Works as a whole tend to avert this trope, since there is really no limit to the media used (It can be as short or as long as the writer wants) and the authors are free to do just about anything they want with the characters. Indeed, many fan works update one chapter/episode/etc. at a time, so if a work hasn't been finished yet, it can be hard to say how long it will be even if you see a table of contents.
</li><li> Many fanfiction websites require stories to be tagged, and tags can very easily be inherent spoilers. For example...
<ul><li> If a story that starts out lighthearted has the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFic">dark</a>" tag, expect things to go downhill eventually. The "Tragedy" genre on Fanfiction.net virtually guarantees a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>.
</li><li> If a story is tagged as "shipping", the presence of romance won't be surprising. Most ship fics also tag the pairing itself, which can ruin the tension in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> stories or those that have a "who will X end up with?" premise. Similarly, if a fic is tagged "slash", don't expect to be surprised by the sudden reveal of a character's sexuality.
</li><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler">the presence of a certain character is inherently a twist</a>, this can be ruined on websites that feature character tags on fanfics.
</li><li> Some fanfic websites require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossovers</a> to be tagged as such. In some fics the fact that the story <em>is</em> a crossover is a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist">Plot Twist</a>, which is ruined by tags like this.
</li></ul></li><li> An odd temporary example happened in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a></em> based <em>Rika Story</em>, which sets out to imagine what a Rika route would be like, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>. The author wrote the bad endings first, so anyone who read it when they were the only options available would be able to figure out which choices were the wrong ones.

</li><li> In <em>Naruto Vengeance Revelations</em>, Ronan is apparently killed for the first time in Chapter 12 out of 69. In gubgub's dramatic reading, she temporarily rejoiced, but then noticed that the many chapters she had left to go indicated his survival unless he had a son.
</li><li> If you know your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a>, it's not hard to figure out that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EigaSentaiScanranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EigaSentaiScanranger">Eiga Sentai Scanranger</a></em> when the heroes have to fight a seemingly invincible enemy that nearly defeats them, they're going to get their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a>. The fic goes a step farther, however, and actually starts all the chapter titles for that arc with "Power Upgrade Part 1, Power Upgrade Part 2," etc.!
</li><li> Probably unintentional, but most of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10026360/">Northstar Pokeshipper's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> stories include notes at the start and at the end of the chapters that usually spoil what's gonna happen (mostly by asking questions with rather obvious answers).

The Tortoise and Achilles decide that books where this is a problem should have a variable amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">padding</a> at the end. Of course, if the padding consists of blank pages, or pages with some simple typographical pattern on them, anyone who casually flips ahead will know when the book is about to end, so you need the padding to actually look like a continuation of the book, but to be thematically different enough that a sufficiently assiduous reader can determine where the book actually ends. They also discuss other means of indicating the location of the "real" end, such as a hidden message or a rash of typographical errors; and sure enough, those are <em>also</em> used by the dialogue itself. Just when they've figured this out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">two police officers show up to arrest the Tortoise for theft, and the dialogue ends</a>.

The last chapter finishes with one of the characters talking about how he believes film is a superior medium to books because you can't tell when the story is about to end just by noticing how many pages are left. He laments the fact that the only way for a writer to avoid this would be to simply refuse to resolve the story at all. At that moment, the book abruptly ends, with its main conflict left unresolved. This is followed in some recent editions by several blank pages.

Thus it's a double subversion: The reader assumes there will be a resolution, both because of the low remaining page count, and because he doesn't know there are two sequels. Just to drive the whole movie point home, the last chapter is done in script format (the rest of the book is prose). The novel ends with the "film" burning up in the projector before the story can be resolved.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvisibleMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvisibleMonsters">Invisible Monsters</a></em> deliberately counters this, even more so in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">"Remix"</a> version. Not only do all versions follow an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a> (as both start at the conclusion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">and work backwards</a>), but the "Remix" even removed the knowledge of remaining length; as each chapter ends similarly to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a> (i.e. "Now turn to page X"), the knowledge of how and when the book ends comes as a total surprise.
</li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> movie novelizations feature movie stills around the middle, a couple of which spoil some scenes or characters from the endings.

Beatrice and Seth, the two protagonists, have what can only be described as a really hot date. Surely they will sort things out now, after eight months of misunderstandings? Surely now Beatrice won't have to marry Rosenschiöld (who's like forty years older than her and treats women like dirt), to whom she was forced to get engaged? But wait!

At the end of the first two volumes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mike is shot up beyond all belief, but we know it's not actually going to kill him off.</span> The impact is lessened the second time.
</li><li> <em>Adventures of the Rope Warrior</em> started ending its installments on little cliffhangers like in an ongoing serial, but the thing is that it started doing this in the second and final book in the series, and thus the installments ending on cliffhangers were chapters in the same book. So in addition to the usual problems of knowing mooks didn't really blow the hero away in a filthy alley with half the book still to go, it was made even worse by how just glancing at the first paragraph on the next page let you know the hero snuck out of his hiding place when the villains shot at it and when he winced it pain it was actually at a bad joke one of them made.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>: New Testament Volume 10 is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> in novel form, and the titles of each chapter make it fairly obvious what enemy will be fought in them (as well as the total number of battles). Needless to say, the format also spoils that Touma and Othinus will get through each encounter, though not necessarily by winning a straight fight. It's subverted in the final chapter, which is titled "V.S. ???  Round_12(Secret)" to hide the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Othinus is the final opponent</span>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in book 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTerribleTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTerribleTwo">The Terrible Two</a></em>:
<div class="indent">Was this the end of the Terrible Two? <br/>Had the story of these two great pranksters come to an end? <br/><br/>No way, of course not. There are still thirty-eight pages left in this book.
</div></li><li> The audiobook of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BestServedCold">Best Served Cold</a></em> spoils two twists by the fact that the narrator reads dialogue of mysterious characters using their distinctive speaking style, making their identity obvious before the text reveals it.
<ul><li> The narrator performs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicomo Cosca</span>'s dialogue with his unique accent and delivery in the scene after his apparent death, spoiling the reveal of his survival.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a>-like sequence makes it seem like Monza and Shivers are having sex with each other but ultimately reveals that they're screwing two different people. The accents of their partners give this twist away prematurely.

<ul><li> Most U.S. poker-based shows that use the "no limit" rule (a player can go "all in" and bet all his chips at any time) qualify. If there are two players left and a player goes "all in", the game will continue if and only if the player with less money wins the hand. So if there's only a minute left in the show, the player with more money will win.

On many exported editions of the show, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToBeWhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToBeWhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">other contests inspired by it</a>, if the first contestant is sent home early and a second contestant is called onstage, it's a safe bet he will drop early as well, since often there isn't enough time for him to play all the way to the ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CashCab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CashCab">Cash Cab</a></em> has a format in which players answer questions while taking a cab ride to their destination. If they get three strikes, they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing">kicked out of the cab</a>. If it's getting very close to the end of the episode and they're nowhere near their destination, it's a pretty obvious sign they're going to lose and get kicked out.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, it's a pretty sure sign that it's a "To be continued..." leg if it's just a few minutes until the end of the episode and still no teams whatsoever have checked into the Pit Stop.
</li><li> On the UK version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal">Deal or No Deal</a></em>, it's always pretty obvious how the game will unfold depending on the board situation and the time left remaining of the show. Are they deliberating at only the 3rd offer with around 10 - 15 minutes to go? Then they will accept the offer. Is there over 25 minutes remaining and they are at the 4th offer? Then they will be going all the way to the end. Have they declined a huge or significant offer at the 5th offer with only a few minutes or so remaining? Then the game will crash and the contestant goes away with a low amount and the whole thing will be wrapped up quickly.
</li><li> There's a Taiwanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMillionPoundDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMillionPoundDrop">The Million Pound Drop</a></em> which, unlike the original, does not have rollover contestants, is not aired live, and is edited down to one hour. So if it's 3 minutes to the hour and it's not the final question of the game, you know the team's going to crash out on the next question.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanNinjaWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanNinjaWarrior">American Ninja Warrior</a></em> has a significant problem with this when it comes to its season finales.

You can tell this will happen if there is an extra commercial break inserted sometime in the mid-game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> is built on a very consistent pattern: The first half is detective work, the second half is the prosecution, and the episode ends with the verdict. Some episodes avert this by having the criminal caught and convicted within the first 15 minutes. The audience knows that a stunning twist or a second crime is about to occur because the show violated its format. And if they didn't, the commercials tell them, especially in later seasons where they inevitably concluded with: "You won't believe the twist in the last five minutes!"
<ul><li> Furthermore, during all three major shows there is another pattern. If an episode has a known celebrity in it, best believe they will play an important role in how the episode ends. From being a key witness, to being the villain whom may or may not get away with it by the time the episode ends.
</li></ul></li><li> Episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> and its spinoffs tend to follow a general pattern - the bulk of the episode is spent following the clues of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryOfTheWeek">case of the week</a>, with the solution coming within the last five minutes and the resolution of the B plot case (if there is a B plot) coming just before or after. As such, anyone designated as a prime suspect before fifty minutes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25wfi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25wfi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25wfi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Minimum - it's certainly not unheard of for one final decoy to be introduced then, with the real culprit caught even later.</span> into the show is virtually guaranteed to be innocent. The format is often played with, however:
<ul><li> The season 7 episode "Toe Tags" presents a series of short cases, punctuated by the corpses of the victims discussing their cases with each other.
</li><li> "The Unusual Suspect" in Season 6 deals with a brother and sister who have confessed to the same murder; the team must decide who is lying. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neither - and they both get away with it.</span>
</li><li> "Turn, Turn, Turn" in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> guest starred as victim Haley Jones. The episode opens fairly normally, with Nick Stokes arriving at a crime scene to find Haley dead. From there, however, the episode travels backward in time to a number of previous cases at the same location, all of which have some bearing on the current one.
</li><li> "Ending Happy" turned this into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: each time the characters thought they had nailed the suspect, they'd get a call from the morgue doctor explaining that whatever that suspect did <em>wasn't</em> the actual cause of death. See the episode's entry under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">Rasputinian Death</a> for further details.
</li><li> "Chaos Theory", had a similar storyline: As the episode progressed, every possible suspect was eliminated by the CSI's own investigations. Somewhere around the 43 minute mark, someone finally proposes that maybe the "murder victim" was "victim" only of a horrible series of coincidental accidents that led to her death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns out to be true, but her parents can't accept that their daughter died from nothing but a series of random events. It's implied as the episode ends that they'll never give up trying to find a culprit.</span>
</li><li> "Check In and Check Out" seems like an ordinary episode: we have a nice couple who help the homeless found murdered in a motel room (stabbed over 100 times each), and the motel room is apparently also the crime scene of two earlier brutal murders. We get an early suspect too soon to be the culprit. Then a homeless man is accused...and turns out to be the actual murderer, seemingly subverting this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There's still half the episode to go, and another murder turns up at the motel room, prompting a closer inspection of the room itself and revealing an air freshener that sprays LSD onto anyone unfortunate enough to set it off and sending them crazy. This almost causes Hodges to kill Henry and is what happened the last four times, and ends up with the owner of the motel arrested for all those murders.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mayday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mayday">Mayday</a></em>, being a documentary series, frequently includes interviews with survivors (if there were any). If passengers and/or crew from the flight in question are being interviewed, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> that at least some people survived. On the other hand, if there are <em>no</em> survivor interviews, it's a pretty safe bet that everyone died.
<ul><li> A particularly notable example: in one episode, the narrator sets up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger">Commercial Break Cliffhanger</a> with the dramatic question of whether rescue workers will arrive in time to save the co-pilot, who is trapped in the burning cockpit. Or rather, it <em>would</em> be a cliffhanger, if not for the fact that said co-pilot had already appeared in several interview segments.
</li><li> In some episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">The Teaser</a> reveals a significant amount of detail about the outcome of the incident.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fifty minutes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticHourLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticHourLong">out of a usual 60</a>) into season 2 finale, everything seems back to normal, even if our heroes had to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rig an election</span> to do it. Then the fraud is exposed, and the episode runs an extra 30 minutes to end on a cliffhanger for the next season to resolve, being the series' first extended episode... although this is played exactly straight if you looked at a TV schedule beforehand and knew the episode ran long.
</li><li> The humans find the planet that they knew was Earth mid-way through the last season and it turns out to be devastated by a (relatively) recent nuclear incident.
</li></ul></li><li> The real-time format of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> means that most of the major action scenes don't take place until three-quarters of the way through any given hour (with very few exceptions). Also, any time an episode's final split-screen is shown with three or four minutes remaining before the beginning of the next hour (especially in later seasons), it's a sign that there's one more scene afterwards (usually as a cliffhanger). Somewhat surprisingly, this is fairly often lampshaded by characters saying something like, "I'll be there to meet the shipment at the docks in 20 minutes." If the viewer checks their watch, and it's 9:35, they can be pretty certain something important/exciting/surprising will be happening there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original series was purposefully episodic, as all television was at the time, so that they could be shown in whatever order the network decided. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> was mostly written that way itself, meaning that in both cases, if the episode had less than ten minutes left and yet the problem-of-the-week hadn't been solved yet, that it would be solved at the last minute. This often had the effect of undercutting the tension in these scenes, especially if the solution was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>, which it often was.
</li><li> Pretty much any of the early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> where they would stumble across gateways, wormholes, or advanced alien technology which gave them the possibility of getting home early. If it happened in episode #2 of series #1 you didn't need to wait for the 60 minutes to be up to know they were going to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> in the end. Solved in later seasons by throwing in <em>partial</em> successes at times (that is, you're spoiled by the format that they won't get all the way home, but it's harder to tell if they won't be able to jump a few years worth of light-years at least).
</li><li> Jennifer Lien, who played Kes, was credited as a regular for the first three seasons of <em>Voyager</em>. In the fourth season premiere, suddenly she's credited as a guest star. They might as well have named the episode "Yes, Kes is Leaving."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> avoided spoiling multi-part episodes by omitting "Part 1" from the title of the first episode (even for season finales, though they weren't fooling anyone). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> stopped using "Part X" entirely after the first few seasons, which was more fitting as the show's longer story arcs frequently blurred the line between single and multi-part episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> usually hits upon the right diagnosis when there's about ten minutes of episode left. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek">Patient of the Week</a> seems cured before that, it's generally safe to assume that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">their condition is about to take a serious nosedive</a>.
<ul><li> There was actually one episode where there were actually <em>numerous</em> patients, and he had cured one less than half-way through the episode.
</li><li> There was also one where House diagnosed a patient within <em>five minutes</em>, and the rest of the episode is centered around their philosophical debates and their ways (or lack thereof) of dealing with their trauma.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> usually starts each segment with a brief snippet showing the last few seconds of the segment in mute monochrome. At least twice, they've put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">stingers</a> in after the snippet shown in the last segment of an episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Foothold". Carter runs away from the base, convinced that it's been taken over by aliens. O'Neill and Daniel track her down in Washington and tell her that she's been exposed to a paranoia-inducing chemical. You might believe them and think the whole episode is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>... except that it's only halfway over, so they can't possibly be telling the truth.
</li><li> Subverted in another episode. We're at the 55-minute mark, bad guys are pounding on the door, the team is frantically working on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> they need to escape — in other words, just a normal day in the life of SG-1 — and then the bad guys break through the door, the team is captured in seconds, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a>, and they spend the next episode trying to escape from a far worse situation.
</li><li> Subverted by the Season 7 finale, "Lost City". Stargate season finales have a tendency to end on a cliffhanger, so at the forty-minute mark when an SG-1 episode usually ends, it wasn't very surprising that there was a large amount of dramatic tension and plot points that would soon be carried over in the Season 8 opening.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most episodes are definitely played straight, but not so much with catching the criminal; it's usually obvious who the killer is by two-thirds of the way through. This trope applies to catching the killer <em>before he kills the next victim</em>. Will the cute blonde die before the team gets there? Nah— only seven minutes left in the episode. She's safe.
</li><li> There's a definite inversion in the season five opener "Nameless, Faceless": the UnSub of the Week is discovered and then caught in the first 25 minutes, but the audience really doesn't care, because they're all waiting to find out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if Hotch survived what looked like a point-blank shot to the head. During the investigation, Prentiss goes to look for Hotch, and finds his blood-spattered apartment, with him missing. Then Prentiss, Reid, and Garcia work the "regular" case in conjunction with searching for Hotch, and it's only when the case is finished that Reid tells the rest of the team that "something's happened to Hotch"</span>. The rest of the episode is devoted to resolving the cliffhanger from the season four finale "To Hell..."/"...And Back".
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, as Crichton <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> finally makes it back to Earth</span> in the middle of a season, rather than in the series finale as might have been expected. Fortunately, by the time this happens the premise of the show had expanded enough that there were still plenty of stories to tell.
</li><li> One of the first episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> featured the gang stuck in a ship that was stuck halfway in a Stargate. They attempted to rachet up the tension by reminding the viewers that the gate would automatically close after 38 minutes, severing the ship in half and killing them all. However, given that they were only a couple episodes into the first season, and there were no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a> on the ship, it was pretty obvious they were all going to make it out alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> Actively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played with</a>, knowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">the audience is smart enough</a> to think that the actual reveal of the mother would be a big deal, so Future Ted, the narrator, will often casually spoil plot points with his way of explaining things, such as occasionally forgetting the name of whatever girlfriend Present Ted has in the episode.

This is further hinted with the episode "Trilogy Time" which shows that Ted with his infant daughter in 2015.

On the other hand, it was not until the end of the half hour that you could wonder whether it was a cliffhanger or an ending. In addition, the Doctor's deaths would usually (but not always) end up at season finales.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoboCopTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoboCopTheSeries">RoboCop: The Series</a></em>, the Mysterious Culprit (the real killer in "Prime Suspect," or the organ thief in "What Money Can't Buy") frequently turns out to be the only remaining guest character who hasn't been either killed already or shown to be guilty of something else.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanelShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanelShow">Panel Show</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WouldILieToYou">Would I Lie to You?</a></em>, there is a regular round called "This Is My...", where each member of one team claims to have a connection with a mystery guest. It will almost <em>never</em> be the team captain who is telling the truth, and the show has actually begun to parody this by deliberately giving the captains the most ridiculous stories to have to claim as true in this round. (Although this was eventually subverted in a Series 12 episode, where David had a claim about the guest recruiting him for an "underground ping-pong club" which sounded <em>so</em> like one of his usual ludicrous made-up stories that the opposing team barely even bothered to take it seriously... only for it to turn out to be true.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist">The Blacklist</a></em> avoids the "two-part episode" problem by not listing "Part 1" in any of the first parts' titles. Second halves of two-part episodes append "Conclusion" to their respective first parts' titles. This won't help if you look up episode lists, but it at least avoided the problem for viewers who watched the show as it aired (or shortly thereafter).
</li><li> This is a frequent occurrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles">Forensic Files</a></em>: if a person is frequently named and depicted but never interviewed, no points for guessing who the killer is. The same goes for the reverse situation, namely if someone is mentioned to be a prime suspect but that person is interviewed then they aren't the killer. And if the "killer" is convicted and sentenced with most of the show left to go, then you're dealing with an episode where that person was innocent of the crime, or there was no crime to begin with, and the rest of the episode is about their struggle to prove their innocence and ultimately be acquitted and freed.
</li><li> Since the series is called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ozark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ozark">Ozark</a></em>, the whole plot line in season two about the main characters planning to leave the Ozarks is obviously not going to end in success.

On a vinyl record you can easily see more grooves, and on a tape you will see there is still some of the tape left to go. Obviously, it doesn't work at all on digital as you can clearly see the "song" is 20+ minutes long, leading to iTunes either indexing the hidden tracks separately, or keeping them as they are but making them album only due to the track length.

The specific instance mentioned was a tennis match, and although the announcers were asking, "Will X make a comeback?" there were only five minutes left in the broadcast, so of course there wouldn't be a comeback, because there wasn't enough time. If there had been a comeback, they would have edited it so there would be time.

If first match up is Stoke vs. Wigan, expect a UFO to land in the centre circle at some point. Likewise if Manchester United don't feature in the first few games then their match must be the kind of 0-0 draw that makes you yearn for the excitement of watching paint dry.

For instance, it's technically impossible to have more than 6 submaps and a 'main' map. So if the world map design/graphics have changed 7 times, you know you're getting close to the end. You can also tell this by the number of switch palaces you've come across, only four different ones as possible without massive reprogramming so you can use them to measure your progress. And in a level, you can tell how close you are to the end just by the number of Dragon Coins you've encountered (with only five per level, if you pass four or five, you know you're probably nearing the end) Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em> much the same applies, there's always five Dragon Coins placed directly before any boss, so if you ever encounter five in a row, you know you're near the end of the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> is kind of funny in that you might initially think <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orochi is the game's primary antagonist</span> and thus expect some sudden turn of events that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prolongs the conflict.</span> But nope, things just nicely wrap up and the characters throw a party before moving on to find other stuff to do.

In the second and third games, the first Rebuttal Showdown opponent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes the victim in Chapter 2</span>. In <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cases 2 and 4 of the second game, and 2, 3 and 4 of the third game</span>, the culprit is one of the Rebuttal Showdown opponents.

</li><li> This can happen with press events as well.

This is somewhat mitigated, though, by the fact that the episode counts are often inaccurate, due to the site's info submission format and episode-page format.

Relatedly, if a character is referred to as one gender in the story, but an entry about them spoilers their gender, that spoils the reveal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">one</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">two</a> tropes.
</li><li> If a character has a very long or very short name compared to the rest of the cast, spoilering the name can end up being pointless. If the entry is about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> and you use spoiler tags to hide the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Q</span> appears in an episode, a reader who knows the series will easily guess who you're talking about.
</li><li> Before the 1.8 redesign, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWord">Wiki Word</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pothole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pothole">Pothole</a> hidden by spoiler markup could still be moused over, which would reveal the URL of the page being linked to. This could spoil it for any reader who accidentally left the cursor over the spoiler tag such as in cases where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">It Was All A Dream</a></span>.
</li><li> Spoilers also involving people that die. Especially in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a> where most names can reach several syllables.
</li><li> Site policy dictates that the trope being labelled should never go inside spoiler tags, meaning that even if the rest of the entry is whited out, the very presence of the trope in the list can spoil the fact that <em>something</em> related to that particular trope is going to happen. It's worse when it's on a Characters page.

</div><ul><li> Made more funny in that his first video on the quickest game overs ended with about the same amount of the time as when <em>Leisure Suit Larry 1</em> beat <em>Grange Hill</em>'s record, so time is padded out with footage of the drug dealer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a> scene without any reference to the time remaining in the video.

For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>, when House makes his first misdiagnosis, the recapper might say something to the effect of: "Since this is just the 15-minute mark, we know that whatever treatment he's prescribed will just make things worse."
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Slowbeef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Slowbeef">slowbeef</a> in <a class="urllink" href="http://lparchive.org/Metroid-Prime/">his Let's Play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, who inserted six minutes of blank filler at the end of a boss fight video to keep viewers from guessing what happens based on how much time there's left in the video.
</li><li> Mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/MarkReadsTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/MarkReadsTwilight">Mark Reads New Moon</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://markreadstwilight.buzznet.com/user/journal/4639221/mark-reads-new-moon-chapter/">chapter 16<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In the previous chapter, Bella had attempted suicide, leading Mark to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">hold a GIF party in celebration</a>. There are 24 chapters in the book, however, so Mark is in no way surprised when she's saved.
<ul><li> A similar point was made during a sporking, when it was commented that Bella might as well say "Goodbye, I love you, because of course I'm not going to survive this even though there are 200 pages left in the book and it's told in first person."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a>'s Achievement Horse series. Take a quick look at the video time, and you can tell from the start how close a game it's going to be.
<ul><li> Same with their Minecraft Let's Plays and their new Versus series. Especially the latter, as they tend to cut away from the game footage to show the AH crew's reactions to who wins.
</li><li> The Criminal Masterminds challenge comes to mind immediately, as each is titled after the heist that they are up to in the challenge itself. The fact that they all appear in order with no repeats shows they at <em>least</em> get up to the final heist in the challenge. However, it is a downplayed example, as the AH crew do set up a system where they can "cheese" it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27dsw');"><sup>Specifically... </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27dsw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27dsw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They arrange a codeword (Bumcheese) that, if yelled out, is a signal for <em>everyone</em> to yank the power cords out of their consoles, as apparently if done fast enough this can be used to circumvent a player death from failing the challenge.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Chuck from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a></em> in the recap of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Duet" notes that the villain has been caught and the ending monologue has been said "huh? Much quicker than usual." Which does seem to be a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode below.
</li><li> Many genre information sites do this. Read io9.com every day when you're the sort who prefers to wait until movies and TV shows come out on DVD to watch them and you're sure to get spoiled by the arbitrary point when the site's writers assume most people have seen a work, even though it hasn't been released on video yet.
</li><li> Part 9 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps">Game Grumps</a></em> playthrough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7">Mega Man 7</a></em> is repeatedly called the "season finale" by Jon and Ego, despite the episode not sporting the "FINALE" label used in all other episodes where they beat a game. Viewers who watched the series after the fact might also be wondering why the series appears to continue for nine more episodes.
<ul><li> The Grumps like to joke about this too, particularly during game levels they are struggling with, where one will say something along the lines of "This time we'll do it" and the other will remark that, since the viewers can see the time bar, if they're only 4 minutes into a 25 minute video odds are he fails miserably again.
</li></ul></li><li> Many computer game casters who use replays will cover up the part of the display showing the time left in the game, to avoid this problem.
</li><li> Analyze Phish is a podcast in which Harris Wittels attempts to get Scott Aukerman to like the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish">Phish</a>, with the understanding that if Scott ever decides to like Phish, the podcast will end immediately. Occasionally, just before Harris plays the next Phish song, Scott will tell the audience that if the current episode is about to end, it's because whatever song that is about to play has convinced him to like Phish. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This never happens.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battleground2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Battleground2012">Battleground (2012)</a></em>, Hulu's one-season show about a political campaign, the primary election occurs halfway through the series. Unless things had taken an unusual turn (such as having the characters all join the same-party opponent's campaign) only a primary victory for the protagonists could provide any story for the rest of the show.

Entering the final match of the video, it's mostly a contest between Matt and Woolie, who are both one win away from their "first to 3" series victory, while Pat still has zero wins. Once Matt gets knocked out, the video briefly cuts to a message from Matt highlighting that the game's winner (and Pat's continued failure) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>:

<ul><li> At one point in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> review, he is conspicuously farther away from the camera, spoofing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer">The Irate Gamer</a>'s misuse of the camera to spoil certain jokes in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> review.
<div class="indent"><strong>Third Rate Gamer:</strong> These games suck so much, it makes me wish that a Thwomp from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> would fall out of the sky in this room and crush me!

If you're familiar with the game and see that the latest episode is at a point far from the game's end, it's a fair bet that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">things aren't going to go well for the player</a>.
</li><li> Sometimes, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video asks the viewer at the beginning if they can guess what's up, they'll lampshade this by acknowledging that the viewers read the title already.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> resides on a forum and consequently is very difficult to follow without spoilers, as reading a version after the fact usually requires going by character, and the site's wiki has a full list of their threads. If the topic you're reading is the last one listed as featuring that character, it's not too hard to draw a conclusion about their fate.
<ul><li> Actively participating in the game also requires reading the announcements, which in character tell the students what is happening and out of character tell participants who is due to die. Since handlers <em>have</em> to read this part or else fail to discover that their own character might be on the chopping block, they will immediately be spoiled on the imminent deaths of the half dozen or so characters rolled.

Until Flanders calls to Homer through the window and Homer tells him to get lost. Lisa and Bart are visibly relieved.
