But now, her days in the spotlight are long gone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodOld">She's over the hill</a>. A joke. A "Where Are They Now?" trivia question. A White Dwarf Starlet: like stars in outer space that have ceased to burn and are now glowing only with residual heat from their active years.
</p><p>But she still yearns for the adoration she received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">during her time as the It-Girl</a> and believes her big comeback will happen any day now.

</p><p>This character is nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a>, for some reason. Maybe it's because a woman in this position is more likely to draw sympathy than a man, or maybe it's because this fate befalls women a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">in real life than it does men</a>.

<ul><li> In a major twist, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">true villain</a> in Satoshi Kon's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em> turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mima's overweight, middle-aged female manager Rumi, who was a former pop idol who didn't last and now thinks she's the real Mima</span>. The climax of the film where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rumi chases Mima in the illusory form of Mima's giggling, pop-idol alter-ego while trying to kill her</span> is genuinely disturbing.
</li><li> Subverted in another Satoshi Kon film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MillenniumActress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MillenniumActress">Millennium Actress</a></em>. The titular actress has faded from the limelight and lives a reclusive life surrounded by memorabilia of her past fame, but her departure from the spotlight was intentional — resulting from a broken heart — and she has no interest in a comeback. She lives in the past because she's not interested in the present.
</li><li> In the anime anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories">Memories</a></em>, the first short, <em>Magnetic Rose</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorThumbprint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorThumbprint">also directed by Satoshi Kon</a>,) has key to its story a once-great opera singer [Eva] who isolated herself in a satellite in the wake of a scandal. It is filled with reminders of her success and uses holograms to simulate a lavish mansion. Her consciousness still haunts the decaying satellite long after her death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesTheJobLovesTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesTheJobLovesTheLimelight">Akira Kogami</a> qualifies for this at age <em>14</em>, having worked as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> since she was 3 years old and now relegated to a three-minute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus">Greek Chorus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">show</a> at the end of each <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> episode. And boy, is she bitter about it.
</li><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>. Ever wonder why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> B.T., the manipulative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to Bear</span> behaves so peevishly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em>? According to a hidden message in the OVAs, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's actually a model who was recently told she's too old to keep in the business</span>. Undoubtedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">The Game Within The Show</a>, <em>The World</em>, is a vent for her.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OAVs</a>, a particular movie studio was supposedly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">haunted by the ghost of such a lady; a silent film star whose roles dried up with the introduction of Talkies. Supposedly this was because while she was beautiful, she had a bad speaking voice but the truth is that her diva attitude alienated everyone in the industry. Since this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a></em>, the rumors are true and her horrific spectre really is hanging around and deadly jealous of the Hanagumi members filming in the studio. The OAV ends with an Aesop of respecting both the cast and crew of a production and the ghost fades away as she returns to the state she was in during her glory days</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em>, where top actress Chigusa Tsukikage was horribly disfigured in a stage accident but she remains extremely popular and famous, and she hasn't even lost her acting skills. Now she's more into teaching and finding an "heiress", and the biggest candidates are Ayumi and Maya.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrivateActress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrivateActress">Private Actress</a></em> is a manga about the acting industry in the Japan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, so there are some of these:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shiho's mother</span> Sayuri Nagasawa <em>almost</em> became this in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> While she IS both beautiful and a very talented actress, getting a huge scar on her face almost ruined her career. Ultimately, she's hinted to have averted the trope by returning to stage acting.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sayuri</span>'s old rival Ruriko Daichi deeply fears to become this, and Shiho spends some time posing as her assistant and helping her to deal with the prospect and her own inner demons. Shiho even gets to beautifully lampshade the trope:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Shiho</strong>: All actresses have their era to shine. Afterwards, they fade away. Like Greta Garbo, retiring in a beautiful house. Or in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, death. But some actresses are still around! Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>... they're all old.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original Silk Spectre, by the time 1985 has rolled around. Subverted in that while she's lost her beauty and her following (and never got the actress career she wanted), she is happy in retirement, with no wish to take up adventuring again, only to reminisce about her glory days and live vicariously through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">her daughter</a> (whom she raised and trained to be Silk Spectre II) a bit.
</li><li> Captain Metropolis is a borderline male example, clinging to his heroic past and trying to organize a new team in the late 60s, despite the fact that where he was once dashing and handsome, he's become a neurotic, paunchy mess whose prejudices have come to the fore.
</li><li> Nite Owl, Hollis Mason, is surrounded by his memorabilia and tells his only friend and successor Dan Dreiberg the same old heroic stories. In Mason's case though, he retired voluntarily after the debut of Dr. Manhattan, figuring that with a literal superman, the world didn't need him anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> Anthem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheOrder">The Order</a></em>, a washed-up actor and friend in long standing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s. How bad is he? Not only had he sunk into depression and become a severe alcoholic, he was resistant to the idea of a comeback because he felt he didn't deserve it. Luckily, he got better before the series began.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> villain Basil Karlo—the original Clayface—is conceived as a male version, a former horror film star who's been left behind by changes in the business.
</li><li> Looney Leo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand">living cartoon character</a> who used to be a major movie and television star, but now spends his day as a restaurateur and living novelty. While he's somewhat used to his life now, he used to be <em>much</em> worse off, having spent time as a homeless drifter after his career faded, made worse by a romantic liaison where the girl turned out to be underage. On top of that, he was haunted by memories of his lover and his three nephews back in the cartoons he came from, people who never actually existed.
<ul><li> Then there's Charlie Provost aka Quark. He used to be Starfighter's sidekick until he went out of control, forcing Starfighter to depower him. Nowadays, he's an alcoholic wreck, bitter over the loss of his powers and living off money earned from convention appearances.
</li></ul></li><li> Fading 1960s actress Danke Schoen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoriLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoriLovecraft">Lori Lovecraft</a></em> bears many of the hallmarks of this trope, although she seems better adjusted than most examples: possibly because her career was very successful (she won two Oscars) before fading into obscurity, and possibly because she has the ace in the hole of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being able to use magic</span>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe3">Despicable Me 3</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Balthazar Bratt</a> was the star of an 80s TV show about a pre-teen supervillain that was cancelled after his reaching puberty invalidated the show's basic concept. Unable to accept that shows end and find a new job, he becomes his character in real life and tries to reproduce his character's crimes, despite the fact that by the time of the movie he is middle aged.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em>: Pound dog Peg is implied to be this; apparently she'd been performing in shows, and her sultry behavior combined with a worn-down appearance reinforce the impression. Being voiced by jazz singer Peggy Lee helps, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sing">Sing</a></em> gives us Nana Noodleman, a former stage actress and singer. Both Buster and Mike express surprise that's she still alive and when the former goes to see her, her mansion is filled with posters and pictures of her in her youth and she wears what appears to be the outfit from her theater days. She also reminisces about the old days when the Moon Theater was "a palace of magic and wonder" and bluntly blames Buster for its downfall.
<ul><li> Nana is a downplayed example; while she does reminisce about the old days, it's only because Buster brought them up and she never expresses a desire to return to her career nor does she seem to care about whether anyone recognizes her. While her mansion is filled with memorabilia, it's in good condition and she's apparently still very wealthy.

<ul><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArtist">The Artist</a></em>, where male superstar actor George Valentin is slowly fading into one as talking movies become the new craze. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he somewhat manages to avoid this fate by becoming a dancing performer</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> would probably be Norma Desmond from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a></em>, a silent film star who never made the transition into talking pictures. Despite her advancing age and secluded existence, she still believes she's big enough to star in one more picture, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> to direct her. Includes a double helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a>, as Desmond was played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GloriaSwanson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GloriaSwanson">Gloria Swanson</a>, who had been one of silent film's biggest stars but who never made the transition to "talkies". In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>, Desmond watches one of her old films, which is the Gloria Swanson movie <em>Queen Kelly</em>. This was directed by Erich Von Stroheim, a once-prominent director whose career behind the camera ended with the silent film era (though he maintained an acting career), who plays Desmond's butler (who, it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was also her first director...and her first husband</span>). (Because <em>Queen Kelly</em> went grossly over budget, and was never completed, it effectively ended both Gloria Swanson's and Erich von Stroheim's careers in the silent movie business.) Interestingly, Swanson had to be made up as older than she looked to play a character who was younger than she was!

</li><li> Susan Alexander in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em>. A bit out of the ordinary: <em>Now</em> she's running on the fumes of her former notoriety, but initially she was pushed into the limelight somewhat against her will and found stardom humiliating.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep">Meryl Streep</a> as Madeline Ashton in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathBecomesHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathBecomesHer">Death Becomes Her</a></em> is one, with the added twist that even in her prime, she actually kinda sucked at performing (she's introduced while starring in a horrendous musical version of <em>Sweet Bird Of Youth</em> that has the audience walk out on it), with her only real appeal being her beauty. Happily, Streep has averted this trope in real life, being one of the longest-lasting starlets in Hollywood history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria">Alegría</a></em> has a touching variant in the Cafe Opera, a watering hole that specifically caters to old, forgotten performers, providing them comfort and support from their peers in their twilight years (some even engage in romances with each other). The owner himself is a dancer and now alcoholic known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Old Taps</a>. (Ironically, his actor, Brian Dewhurst, is a circus performer who had already worked with Cirque on and offstage. A year or two after the film was shot, he joined Cirque's <em>Mystere</em> as a clown, and is still with the show today...)
</li><li> Sam (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">Peter Sellers</a>) in <em>The Optimists</em> is a variant. He apparently was almost famous in English vaudeville at one point and certainly has the ramshackle house, old costumes and clippings, and drinking problem. But in his old age, he still performs as a busker (street performer) and seems content to get by that way, with no delusions of grandeur.
</li><li> <em>After the Fox</em>, another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">Peter Sellers</a> film, has former "international handsome star" Tony Powell. He's artificially tanned and white-toothed (which he shows off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler">Perpetual Smiler</a>), uses shoe polish to cover his graying hair and is convinced that he's perfect to make a comeback as the hero of the old noir films he used to star in while his agent tries to bring him to reality. Sellers' character is easily able to manipulate him. Powell was played by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">self-parodying</a> Victor Mature.
</li><li> Downplayed male example: Alex Fletcher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MusicAndLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MusicAndLyrics">Music and Lyrics</a></em> certainly fits the 'forgotten has-been' aspect of the trope, but doesn't display much serious desire to get back to the way things were; his main motivation is not to get back onto the top but to keep his profile up high enough so that he can keep doing the low-rent theme park gigs that sustain him (and possibly even land a lucrative contract at Disney Land).
</li><li> Another male example: Buddy Young Jr. in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSaturdayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSaturdayNight">Mr. Saturday Night</a></em>.
</li><li> Vitriolic producer Les Grossman uses these exact words to describe Tugg Speedman if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder">Tropic Thunder</a></em> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">movie-within-the-movie</a>) fails.

</li><li> Velma Von Tussle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em>, especially in the later versions. Her song "The Legend of Miss Baltimore Crabs" details her beauty queen past.
</li><li> Elise Elliot is on her way to becoming this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFirstWivesClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFirstWivesClub">The First Wives Club</a></em>. She is still recognised by her fans, but her career is fading. She is struggling to get a role and when she finally thinks she will be cast as the star of a new film it turns out the young and hip regisseur wants her as the ugly and grotesque Mother. She has undergone major plastic surgery and is an alcoholic. She drunkenly complains about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a> is 400 years old and still a star, but women are cast as the mother when they are older than 20. In her apartment, she has an entire room filled with her memorabilia, including prizes she won, gifts, etc. Fortunately, at the end of the film, she gets better.
</li><li> Bertha in <em>Poor Pretty Eddie</em> was a successful and glamorous showgirl, but is now an overweight, middle-aged alcoholic who surrounds herself with old photos of herself and practically defines herself by her abusive relationship with a much younger Eddie. When Liz, a famous jazz singer, ends up at Bertha's motel, Bertha immediately becomes jealous of her and constantly antagonizes her, most notably by refusing to help Liz after she's raped by Eddie. In her mind, she believes that keeping Liz as Eddie's captive at the motel will teach her a lesson about how one day, Liz's fame will dry up just like hers did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowToLoseFriendsAndAlienatePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowToLoseFriendsAndAlienatePeople">How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People</a></em> has a very sympathetic example as a minor character. Sidney notices that she's alone and downcast at a huge celebrity hobnob, ignored by everyone else in attendance, despite her long and respectable career in Hollywood. The older actress is genuinely touched when he introduces himself as a huge fan.
</li><li> Max Bialystock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers">The Producers</a></em> was once a successful Broadway Producer (at least in his own mind), but is washed-up and forced to sponge off of little old ladies when the show starts. This is especially true in the musical version, where he opens the show singing, "I used to be the King, the King of Old Broadway."
</li><li> The entire band in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">This is Spın̈al Tap</a></em>. Not that they aren't popular anymore, not by any means, it's just that "their appeal has grown more selective." A truly sad moment in this uproarious comedy is when the band hears an oldies station playing one of their hits as "The Thamesmen"... followed by the DJ consigning them to the "Where Are They Now?" file, when where they are is playing a concert in that very city. Ultimately subverted: it turns out they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">big in Japan</a>.

The Story of Anvil</em>. The band was huge in the '80s, sharing the stage with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a> but ended up completely forgotten by history. Their documentary ends with a concert in Japan, where thousands of fans turn up despite a bad spot on the schedule.

He gets called out of retirement to reprise his role for real.
</li><li> An infamous example: Joan Crawford (played by Faye Dunaway) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest">Mommie Dearest</a></em>. As Crawford got older (both in the film and in real life), she parlayed her talents into increasingly ridiculous guest appearances and starring roles in an attempt to regain her stardom. Most infamously, Crawford took over a role intended for her daughter (who was a good thirty years younger than her) in a bid to get her name back in the spotlight.
</li><li> Helen Sinclair in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletsOverBroadway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletsOverBroadway">Bullets Over Broadway</a></em>. "<em>Don't</em> speak!"
</li><li> Faded rock star Rex Manning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EmpireRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EmpireRecords">Empire Records</a></em>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by a teenage boy who gets an autograph from Manning because "my mom has all your albums" despite never personally having heard a single one of Manning's songs. Subverted in the Director's Cut version of the film. In an alternate take of the "You're just a has-been" scene, he trades his cocky attitude and quote from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s "My Generation", for a heartfelt and bitter "you might be right" acknowledgment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DinnerAtEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DinnerAtEight">Dinner at Eight</a></em> provides a very sad example in Larry Renault, who was a big star in the silent movie days but who now is a washed-up alcoholic who can't even get jobs in vaudeville. After his disgusted manager gives Larry an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, Larry is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>.
</li><li> This is the entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhateverHappenedToBabyJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhateverHappenedToBabyJane">Whatever Happened To Baby Jane</a>?</em>. Jane Hudson is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former Child Star</a> in vaudeville theater, and her sister Blanche was a successful film actress as a young adult. Now Blanche is crippled from Jane accidentally hitting her with a car, and Jane is a disturbed alcoholic who can't accept that her career dried up when she aged and couldn't make the transition to movies. She still dresses like she does when she was 'Baby Jane', and resents and torments Blanche. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Actually, Blanche was the one driving the car, attempting to hit <em>Jane</em>. Blanche had resented that she was tied to her scandal-ridden, talentless sister, and tried to kill her. The book even states that she prevented Jane from seeking psychiatric help in order to better manipulate her. The film ends with Blanche presumably dead and Jane having snapped completely, believing that the police and crowds are there to see her comeback.</span>

This skit came out after her album <em>Artpop</em> was a commercial failure since people were starting to tire of her over-the-top antics. Ironically, she would later reinvent herself as a classier, more low-key performer in the years that followed, and she's had a respectable amount of fame since.

One of his victims, Dorie Larkin, always hid behind scarves and veils. Bravely appearing on television, she explained that she wanted the surgery because roles that she felt should have gone to her were going to younger actresses, and she was being cast as maiden aunts. When no reputable surgeon would help, because she had the wrong skin type, she turned to Dr. Green, and he butchered her face.

The reason he counts as a White Dwarf is because he is so often portrayed as a has-been ever since the time he lost his job at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a>.

He never has any further successes that would make him just as proud as the one time he got lucky and became a star of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a>.

It's more explicit in the film version, where Archie's an obviously terrible performer who's openly heckled by his audiences and coasts on his father's reputation.
</li><li> It's strongly implied that Margo in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Applause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Applause">Applause</a></em> is headed in this direction, lampshaded by a review which describes her as "discreetly lit by all the pink gelatin on Broadway." (Light filtered through pink "gels" can make people appear younger; if a production uses enough of them for you to notice, it's a sign that one of the actors is too old to play the role they're in.)

Having lost both his career and his good looks when the local Nosferatu Embraced him, much of his spare time is spent dressed up in a tuxedo, conducting "wrap parties" with the corpses of long-dead actors, and occasionally trying to remind visitors that he was once a Hollywood star.

He spent a considerable amount of his fortune having his home redesigned into a replica of the Ferretcave and his alter ego's mansion so accurate that everything actually worked.

<div class="indent">[On the red carpet before the Academy Awards] <br/><strong>Joan Rivers' Head:</strong> Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whats-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one? <br/><strong>Harold Zoid:</strong> I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space.

Baboon as ghosts who are tasked with scaring a retired starlet (played, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobAsThePlotDemands">as usual</a>, by The Red Guy), who spends all her time reminiscing about her glory days.

</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> skit featured a middle-aged, overweight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a> taking up a job as an entertainer for children's birthday parties.

</div></li><li> Randy Marsh in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. He used to sing in a boy band, but instead of stardom he eventually went to college. He still sometimes memorizes his youth in music and he can play guitar really well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> features Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, Bikini Bottom analogues of Batman and Robin (and actual superheroes within the SpongeBob universe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSuperhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSuperhero">albeit far past their prime</a>) who (via the intervention of SpongeBob) frequently end up attempting to relive their past days of glory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Sepulveda Boulevard" is a parody of both <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> and the trope itself with Elmyra playing the Norma role, a former cartoon star whose career tanked because audiences no longer wanted cute (in her own mind, anyway).
</li><li> The episode "Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?" has Sappy Stanley, an embittered elephant who moved to France after losing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>.
</li><li> Both cartoons even paraphrase the "pictures that got small" speech from <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Piella Bakewell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AMatterOfLoafAndDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AMatterOfLoafAndDeath">A Matter of Loaf and Death</a></em>. Wallace recognizes her as the spokeswoman for Bake-O-Lite Bread, but she was fired as the "Bake-O-Lite Girl" when she became too heavy to fly the balloon they used in advertising. She's more broken-up about this than she lets on, as Wallace and Gromit learn when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out to be the "cereal killer" who's been offing bakers all across town</span>. Though given the content of the spoiler, one really does wonder if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">whether her version of events shouldn't be taken with a pinch of salt.</a>
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> is a male example. Bojack was the star of a surprise hit sitcom called <em>Horsin' Around</em> back in the '80s and early '90s but quickly fizzled out after the show ended, and has spent the past 20 years pining for the glory days and sabotaging any chances at a comeback because of his massive ego and emotional problems. He spends most of his time, especially in season 1, watching old episodes of the show, to the point where he carries around DVDs of it!
<ul><li> Sarah Lynn, who played the youngest child on the show, is just on the cusp of becoming one of these. She was by far the most successful of the cast (aside from Bojack, one of the other child actors turned to theater and the other quit acting), and had massive success as a teen pop star and actress. However, by the time the show starts, her career is winding down as she's replaced by younger icons, and she's even dumped by her publicity boyfriend Andrew Garfield. Ironically, she doesn't even like acting all that much, having been pushed into it by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a>, but eventually became addicted to the attention and fame (making her a distaff counterpart to Bojack who had the same happen to him). Season 3 ends with her winning an Oscar and seemingly set up a comeback, but she says herself that the win isn't making her feel any happier <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she dies of a drug overdose, making the whole thing moot</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> has Clayface II be Basil Karlo or at least an expy of him; a washed-up former horror movie star whose desire to get back into acting leads to him stealing the experimental mutagenic putty that gave the first Clayface in his universe - Ethan Bennet, a cop - their powers and drinking it to mutate himself on purpose.
</li><li> Early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> featured Troy McClure, a B-list actor who had starred in a <em>ridiculously huge</em> array of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B Movies</a>, junky commercials and failed TV shows, and persisted trying to chase A-list stardom despite his long litany of flops. Ironically, one episode in which he manages to score the lead position in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical">The Musical</a></em>, shows he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor">Master Actor</a>; he's just so desperate to leap into stardom that he makes himself look worse than he really is by constantly appearing in schlocky productions. His myriad vices, including raging alcoholism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">an unspeakable fish fetish</a>, don't improve his chances.
