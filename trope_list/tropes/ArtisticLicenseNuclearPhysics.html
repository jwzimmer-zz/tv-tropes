<ul><li> In real life, a nuclear weapon requires precise conditions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dsks');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dsks" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dsks');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The precise engineering of a nuclear weapon makes the best Swiss watch look like a flint knife in comparison.</span>to achieve a full-scale explosion (mainly a sphere of conventional explosives being set off in unison around the nuclear mass, compressing it to supercriticality and initiating a nuclear reaction) while fictional nukes act <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerExplosive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerExplosive">like spheres filled with mega-nitroglycerin</a>. Shooting, or even blowing up a real-life nuclear weapon with conventional explosives is likely to <em>disable</em> the warhead, not set it off<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1pu49');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1pu49" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1pu49');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The standard setup for a nuclear bomb is a sphere of weapons grade fissile material surrounded by conventional explosives. The explosives are directed inward in order to generate the necessary chain reaction. High precision engineering is required to get everything to come together properly; if things are off by even milliseconds, the yield will be dramatically reduced and it may fizzle entirely. In fact, partial detonation of the explosives will disable the nuclear weapon (but probably contaminate the area with radiation).</span>. Blunt force will not set off a nuclear weapon either, no matter how hard.
<ul><li> In fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.org/details/StaySafe1960">here's a film produced by the US Air Force back in 1960<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showing nuclear weapons being purposely dropped out of planes, set on fire, and otherwise subjected to movie-of-the-week hijinks to demonstrate that rough treatment of nuclear weapons does not result in said weapons detonating. It should be noted though, as the narrator repeatedly assures us, that these bombs do not actually contain radioactive material "so as not to waste this precious resource", defeating the point of the tests somewhat.
</li><li> All of the above applies only to unarmed nukes. Modern nuclear warheads are specifically designed to go boom when armed and subjected to external stimulus, such as being intercepted.
</li></ul></li><li> If a reactor does melt down or is going to melt down, the hero usually has to manually initiate a SCRAM, an emergency shutdown, sometimes going to elaborate lengths to set the SCRAM up or even having to manually insert the control rods into the reactor one at a time. This is as opposed to real life, where it's typically an automatic safety feature which engages if the reactor shifts outside a certain set of safe operating parameters and where a manual reactor SCRAM is as simple as turning a switch. A switch that usually exists in multiple redundant locations both near and far away from the reactor room, so that you can always reach at least one during an emergency. What's more, even the failsafe have "dead-man" failsafes. Usually, the SCRAM mechanism has to actively <em>prevent</em> the shutdown from happening — for instance, by constantly pushing against a spring, or holding up control rods with an electromagnet. If the power to the safety systems is interrupted even for a moment, the mechanism stops resisting and the reactor shuts down.
</li><li> Similarly, fictional nuclear reactors will meltdown or go up in gigantic nuclear explosions at the slightest thing going wrong. A nuclear reactor simply cannot cause a full-scale nuclear explosion: fuel assemblies are arranged into long, thin columns separated by cladding; the large surface area causes a significant percentage of the available fission neutrons to dissipate into the moderator rather than causing further fission events, preventing a critical mass from forming. A core for a nuclear weapon needs a near-spherical shape for any kind of runaway chain reaction, and depending on size and material may also need a neutron reflector. Even in the extremely unrealistic scenario when nuclear fuel made of pure metallic weapons-grade uranium or plutonium (something that simply doesn't exist - see below) melts down and forms a perfect sphere of critical mass, it still needs one more condition to explode: for this mass to be squeezed into the critical radius, achieved in bombs only under tremendous pressure created by chemical explosives and in a very short (on the order of milliseconds) time window. Otherwise this sphere will simply heat up and boil.
</li><li> As a matter of fact, most of the nuclear fuel in the world is NOT metallic. It is based on the metal oxides precisely to prevent it from easily melting or burning. And no matter how hard one tries, it is simply impossible to reach critical radius with oxides.
<p></p></li><li> Assuming that a reactor SCRAM / shutdown means the absolute end of a casualty. A reactor "shutdown" simply slows down fission events to a subcritical level; the radioactive decay of fission products inside the reactor still produces a significant amount of heat — enough in the case of Three Mile Island (which was SCRAMmed very early in the timeline of the casualty) to damage the core and release radioactive material into the environment. The reactors in Fukushima were shut down upon the initial earthquake and still produced enough decay heat days later to cause full meltdown and hydrogen explosions. Even worse, at Chernobyl, the SCRAM signal aggravated the casualty (inside baseball: the control rod followers were made of neutron-transparent graphite, and replaced neutron-absorbing water in the control rod channels, causing a temporary spike in fission events before the even-more-neutron-absorbing boron control rod body was in place, driving the reactor over the edge into prompt criticality).
</li><li> In fiction, a reactor melting down is always a Chernobyl-level catastrophe regardless of design. Most of the consequences of the Chernobyl meltdown were a direct result of the plant being built without a containment building, a structure that surrounds the reactor itself and is intended to reduce any consequences of a leakage or meltdown. In addition at Chernobyl, several safety systems were deliberately turned off for a scheduled experiment. These work rather well: in Three Mile Island, the containment building duly contained the steam and other bad effects of the meltdown. No pyrotechnics; in fact, the radiation released from Three Mile Island was less than the radiation coming from your computer monitor.
<ul><li> Even in the SL-1 incident in 1961 (the only fatal reactor accident in the United States and another example of terrible control rod design), which lacked a designed containment building, the regular old building contained most of the radioactivity. Even with that, it proved that the core and water coolant vaporizing would prevent the core from melting down.
</li><li> Chernobyl's core of uranium fuel was surrounded by graphite, making the reactor a giant block of charcoal waiting to ignite into carbon-14 =&gt; radioactive CO2 goodness. British nuclear power plants also use graphite as the moderator, except for Sizewell B, but they use carbon dioxide gas as coolant where Soviet reactors used water. It was the combination of graphite moderator and water coolant that made Chernobyl a death trap.
</li><li> In addition, the conditions for Chernobyl accident were caused by 'scientists' performing experiments during the night shift, when the inexperienced crew, only capable of following directions from a manual, were not aware of, or able to properly react to, the conditions before it was too late to save the reactor. What happened was the operators initiating the test <em>after</em> they screwed up and hastily corrected themselves. The screw-up was safe and unrelated to the experiment, and had they shut down the reactor normally as intended (and written in the manual) nothing would happen. They, however, pressed on (allegedly to have something to report as an achievement at the upcoming May Day celebration - and even then, it was after two of the more senior operators complained that it wasn't safe to proceed, though when they were threatened with losing their cushy jobs they knuckled under). Unfortunately, their previous actions has left the reactor in the unstable and unstudied state, and in the process of the test they removed <em>the last</em> control rods, causing the reactor to heat up. When it got WAY too hot, they tried to fix it by fully inserting all the control rods. The reactor promptly blew up, though it was not actually a nuclear blast, it just threw radioactive junk everywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> The Void Coefficient is probably deemed too scientific for the general public, so it's conveniently assumed that all reactors will suffer the same from thermal runaway. In real life, most reactors have a negative Void Coefficient, which means that they will reduce their thermal output when gas (steam) bubbles form in the coolant. In contrast, a positive Void Coefficient will increase heat output when gas bubbles form in the coolant. A well known reactor model with a dangerously high positive Void Coefficient is the Реактор Большой Мощности Канальный (High-Powered Channel-Type Reactor). Originally, this model's Void Coefficient was 4.7 beta, but it has been lowered to 0.7 beta after one of the reactors of this model gained negative publicity due to the Chernobyl accident.
</li><li> Despite the common trope of villains (less commonly: the hero) stealing nuclear reactor fuel rods to build weapons out of, in real life, reactor fuel and weapons material are simply not interchangeable. Nuclear weapons require specific isotopes — uranium-235 or plutonium-239 — of very high purity (referred to as "weapons grade"), and reactor fuel doesn't even come close. A practical uranium design requires its uranium to be around 80% or more uranium-235, while the fuel in a civilian nuclear reactor consists of just <strong>3-5</strong>% uranium-235, and in a submarine reactor up to 20%<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2es0y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2es0y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2es0y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As late as the late 1980s, there were at least a few research reactors still using small amounts of highly enriched uranium sandwiched as thin layers in aluminium plates instead of partially-enriched pellets. Separating U-235 from U-238 is difficult and relies on technologically advanced, incredibly expensive equipment like gas centrifuges; separating U-235 from aluminium just takes someone capable of performing relatively straightforward chemistry. Which is one of the reasons this design is no longer used. The amounts of fuel involved were just on the order of a few kilograms, though.</span>. And while you can relatively easily (assuming you have a fully equipped radiochemical plant) extract plutonium from spent fuel (and some fuels contain plutonium already mixed in), it will be a mixture of isotopes with only a small fraction being plutonium-239. <strong>Any</strong> significant admixture of other isotopes will make the plutonium useless or worse for weapons use, and isotope separation is a long, slow, infrastructure-dependent, and energy-intensive operation beyond the reach of most governments, never mind terrorist organisations. Conversely, fuel elements made of such highly-enriched isotopes simply react <em>longer</em> rather than more energetically. The average reactor eats about one rod a day; a theoretical reactor using weapons-grade fuel rods would eat one rod a month due to the removal of "nuclear poisons," which build up in "spent" fuel rods.
</li></ul></li><li> And on the subject of Criticality, any time some thing goes wrong in a nuclear facility, terrified screams of "It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">Going Critical</a>" will fill the air, or the villain's plan will be to make the reactor go Critical. "Critical" means that the reaction is self sustaining and that the reaction is proceeding at a constant level — in other words, a critical reactor is one that is operating at a steady constant power level. <em>One more time, "Critical" reaction is the normal operating condition of a nuclear reactor.</em> Super-Critical, while not used despite sounding definitely bad, simply means that the reaction is steadily gaining power, or simply, someone getting powered by the reactor turned on a light and so the reactor went temporarily super-critical to increase its energy output for the new drain. Finally, there <em>IS</em> a condition that would (almost) elicit the reactions of a Hollywood type critical reactor. It's called <strong>Prompt</strong>-Critical, and if a reactor has had this happen,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ewkn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ewkn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ewkn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is what destroyed the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1">SL-1<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> reactor in Idaho in 1961. The operators, whilst performing maintenance on the reactor, accidently removed the primary control rod entirely from the core. This immediately resulted in a major power output spike, which overheated the core to the point that steam pressure ejected the control rod and embedded it into the ceiling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">taking one of the operators with it</a>.</span> there'd be no running around trying to prevent it or saying it happened; by the time any readings showed this happening, it would already be too late, and either the automatic safety systems would have kicked in and shut down the reactor, or the reactor pile would be an actual pile of slag. The pulse operation mode of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ga.com/triga">TRIGA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> research reactors is an intentional (and safe) invocation of this state.
<ul><li> Due to the abovementioned misconception of "critical mass", it's Hollywood-assumed that any minor wrong could send a nuclear reaction to prompt-critical. This is not practically the case, because, as we should more accurately speak of "critical density", most nuclear reactors are designed to stay below that at any time, including loss-of-coolant situations.
<ul><li> Most commercial reactors are cooled and moderated by water; a loss of coolant would risk fuel melting, but the reactor would go subcritical from the loss of coolant. Even if they are moderated by graphite, like Chernobyl or Windscale reactors, the meltdown is the worst thing that ever can happen with them. The most of the damage in Chernobyl and Fukushima was from the destruction of the reactor <em>buildings</em>, that lead to the spread of the "hot" junk around.
</li></ul></li><li> This comes from the Hollywood idea of reactors as bombs-in-waiting. When a nuclear bomb "goes critical", it's actually going Prompt-Critical which is why it explodes, thus when a reactor goes critical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">it becomes a bomb and explodes</a>.
</li><li> There <em>is</em> such a thing as a <em>criticality accident</em>, but this is something rather different. A criticality accident occurs when a critical mass of fissile material appears unintentionally. This doesn't happen in reactors; it happens in laboratories and fuel processing plants due to process accidents  and to the people who work in such settings, the possibility of a criticality accident is pretty much their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">One True Nightmare</a>. For more information, see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf">this document<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Assuming the reactor core is inside the cooling tower. Because most people associate "nuclear power plants" with those giant hyperboloid structures as seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, it's an easy mistake to assume that they <em>are</em> the plant and contain the reactor. In reality, the reactor is typically located in a separate block-shaped building (which ideally serves as a containment), and the towers are just the enormous radiators that contain and manage the cooling water. There are other types of power plants (such as coal plants) that have cooling towers which look just like the ones commonly associated with nuclear plants, whereas there are nuclear plants that don't <em>have</em> cooling towers. Notably, both the wrecked Chernobyl and Fukushima plants don't have them (Chernobyl has an unfinished cooling tower intended for unfinished additional reactors): Chernobyl used cooling ponds instead of towers, and given that Fukushima was situated right next to the Pacific Ocean, building cooling towers would be unnecessary as water could be piped straight in and pumped straight back out once it had been cooled down. Since the cooling towers are <em>open</em> on the top, placing the reactor inside would <em>expose it to the open air</em>, which would obviously be a bad idea.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">     Idea 2: Nuke-grenade! FIRE IN THE HOLE! </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ol><li> On the subject of critical mass, while both low-yield nukes and still-bulky "suitcase" nukes do exist in real life, critical mass means that there is an absolute lower limit on the size, weight, and yield of fission-based nuclear weapons. There are some exotic transuranic elements such as curium and californium with a much smaller mass, and in theory you could make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">atomic grenade</a> out of them. In practice, they (and just about anything besides uranium and plutonium) would suffer from a whole rash of pre-ignition and stability issues, so you wouldn't be able to get them to explode outside of ludicrously rare lab conditions. (The reason that uranium and plutonium are useful in nuclear weapons is that they're not <em>that</em> radioactive. The plutonium isotope used in weapons has a half-life of 24,000 years; U-235 has a half-life of 700 <em>million</em> years. The <em>really</em> intense stuff is too unstable to actually build a weapon around.)
<ul><li> "Critical mass" is a highly misunderstood term. Whether a sample of fissile material will produce an uncontrolled chain reaction is dependent on (roughly) the ratio of mass to surface area. If the ratio is too low (too much surface area) neutrons escape without causing further fission. If it's above the critical ratio, then of the three neutrons produced by each fission, on average &gt;1 will cause another fission (meaning that the rate of reactions will grow). The oft quoted "critical mass" is the critical mass where <em>a sphere</em> of the material at a given density will go critical on its own. Thus, you can have a solid subcritical chunk of a fissile material of a larger mass than that value, as long as it has a different geometry (e.g. shaped like a rod instead of a sphere)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4b98z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4b98z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4b98z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This has been the cause of several accidents where workers have transferred material from one vessel to another of a different shape. An amount that's safe in one vessel might go critical in another. When this happens unintentionally it causes a "criticality accident", discussed in the previous section.</span>. It's also possible to detonate a bomb with less than the "critical mass" of material — typically by the use of neutron reflectors.
</li></ul></li><li> Since All Nuclear Explosions Are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NuclearWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NuclearWeapons">the Deadliest Mushroom</a>, a nuke will <em>always</em> make a mushroom cloud no matter how small it is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosionsInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosionsInSpace">even in a vacuum</a>. This is sometimes played for humor. Similarly, mushroom clouds are <em>only</em> created by nuclear weapons, rather than <em>any</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingMakesAMushroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingMakesAMushroom">sufficiently large explosion</a>.
<ul><li> Typically, the size and duration of the fireball and mushroom cloud will also have no real relation to how powerful the weapon is supposed to be.
</li><li> Also, a nuclear explosion in a visual medium will often produce a series of vertical lines of smoke. These are copied from nuclear tests, but are not actually anything to do with the explosion; they're trails from rockets fired to give a visible indication of the shockwave.
</li><li> Even in places with an atmosphere, the visual characteristics of the explosion are highly dependent on the local medium; thus, ones exploded underwater, underground, on the surface, in an airburst relatively near the ground, or in the high atmosphere all have <em>very</em> distinctly different appearances.
</li></ul></li><li> In a variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsNoisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsNoisy">Space Is Noisy</a>, in a manner also frequently applied to lightning and conventional explosions, even when a nuclear explosion is accurately depicted visually (dazzling flash of light, followed by a rising mushroom cloud and shock waves racing outwards across the ground destroying everything that is not already on fire), frequently it will be heard to produce a deafening roar from the outset, long before the shock wave reaches the camera. Since the shock wave travels somewhat faster than the speed of ordinary sound, the initial flash and subsequent fiery visuals should actually be silent until the wavefront hits, save for the damage caused by the blast's radiation. For any observer sitting far enough away from the explosion to stand a chance of surviving it, this delay should be quite noticeable. Even documentaries have been known to get this wrong (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpaceRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpaceRace">The Space Race</a>).
<ul><li> An interesting phenomenon is that a fair number of close-to-Ground-Zero survivors of the Hiroshima bombing reported that they <em>did not hear the explosion at all</em>. There is a welter of plausible explanations for this freakish occurrence (being in underground bank vaults, psychological effects, memory tricks), but no real evidence. Here's to hoping that we can keep that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">a mystery unanswered by replicated experiments</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">     Idea 3: Fission = Fusion </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ol><li> Fission is breaking up a heavy nucleus (usually uranium or plutonium) into two lighter nuclei, plus a few loose neutrons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note548ay');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note548ay" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note548ay');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which are critically (hee hee) important</span>. Fusion is pretty much the opposite: joining light nuclei (usually hydrogen isotopes) into a heavier one (usually helium). Since fusion and fission-based technology are both atomic, nuclear fusion is depicted as the same as but more than nuclear fission. Plutonium is usually similarly depicted in relation to uranium.
<ul><li> The existence of fusion-assisted nuclear weaponry is simply not acknowledged. All nuclear weapons, even those in the multimegaton range, run entirely off of fission. Typically, if a "fusion bomb" is talked about, it will imply that the device is extremely futuristic.
<ul><li> The hydrogen bomb or "H-Bomb" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">fission-ignited fusion reaction</a>, or a "fission-fusion" bomb. Due to the high initiation temperature required for the fusion reaction to take place, this is known as a "thermo-nuclear" rather than a nuclear device. The term thermonuclear, while often applied to all fission weapons, correctly refers only to the fission-fusion or h-bomb type weapon.
</li><li> The difference between a fission weapon and a fission-fusion weapon is academic at best; immediately after WWII, most new A-bombs were made using "boosted fission" (in which a small fusion reaction is initiated in order to provide more neutrons and more efficient fission), and a "fission-fusion" weapon still derives most of its energy from fission.
</li><li> Most fission-fusion weapons use a cladding of uranium-238, which will absorb most of the massive number of 'unused' fusion neutrons and then fission; the bomb is now a 'fission-fusion-fission' bomb. Without that U-238 cladding, the neutrons spray out at high speed, irradiating the near area, and you have what the US called an 'Enhanced Radiation Reduced Blast' weapon — also known as the "Neutron Bomb".
</li><li> There are two main types of fusion bombs: the American Teller-Ulam type (also known as "Sakharov's Third Idea"), and the Soviet Sakharov type, also called "the layer cake". The Teller-Ulam bomb consists of a fission starter charge (often called the primary), a lithium deuteride fusion fuel block (often with the additional neutron source) next to it, clad by the U-238 "pusher" or "tamper" (the whole assembly usually dubbed the secondary), and the shaped heavy metal case. When activated, the primary emits a lot of hard X-rays that are reflected from the case to the secondary, ablating the tamper's exterior and causing it to compress, which in turn starts the fusion. Sakharov-type bomb has the starter completely surrounded by the fuel and the U-238 case, and the starter is optimized to emit mostly neutrons. When activated the neutrons are absorbed by the case, which then starts to fission, and the heat and radiation from the exploding case compresses and activates the fuel. It is called "layer cake" because layers of lithium and uranium could be repeated, increasing the device's output.
</li><li> All modern warheads use the Teller-Ulam system, as the "Layer cake" design was rather inefficient, but it let the Soviet scientists to create an upgrade of the American design, where the additional fission-fusion stages are added to the device, thus making it of theoretically unlimited power. The most powerful thermonuclear device ever detonated, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba">the "Tsar Bomba"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was reportedly a three-stage device employed in a two-an-a-half staged configuration, with the tamper of the tertiary made of lead and not the U-238 to reduce the fallout. With the uranium tamper the bomb's projected output was 101.5 megatons, lead tamper reduced it to just ~50 Mt.
</li><li> To clarify: The "layer cake" design was abandoned as soon as the Teller-Ulam design had been arrived at (the US, the UK and the USSR all got it at roughly the same time, with a certain amount of help from espionage). Multi-stage devices are made of a cascade of Teller-Ulam stages, one Teller-Ulam stage acting as the primary of a larger Teller-Ulam stage. The cascade can be continued more or less indefinitely, but no more than three stages are required for any militarily useful yield. The Tsar Bomba - which was purely for show, and militarily useless - was a Teller-Ulam cascade.
</li><li> It is theoretically possible to build a fusion bomb without a fission primary, what would be referred to as a pure-fusion weapon. Proposed "alternate primaries" include exotic nuclear isomers, sufficiently powerful lasers or flux compression generators, or even minute quantities of anti-matter. Such weapons would theoretically have the advantage over Teller-Ulam devices in yield control and produce nearly no fallout. However current technological limitations mean none of these methods are currently within reach as even an experimental device, much less a practical weapon, leaving them in the realm of science fiction for now.
</li></ul></li><li> Fusion power tends to be depicted as operating in exactly the same way as nuclear power; while the reactor set / prop might look futuristic, expect talk of chain reactions and meltdowns in relation to a fusion plant, even though neither term could possibly be applied to any practical nuclear fusion plant. Fusion reactions are not self-sustaining unless they happen inside a star; in fact, the ongoing problem preventing us from achieving a fusion-powered grid is that it currently takes a lot more constant energy influx to cause the reaction to happen than can be gathered by it. Additionally, the fusion reaction itself requires exceedingly delicate conditions, carefully maintained by massive electromagnets and vacuum pumps. As a result, instabilities, fluctuations or otherwise serious problems in a fusion reactor will merely cause the reactor to instantly and mostly harmlessly shut itself down.
</li><li> Alternately, fusion may be shown as a perfect, clean energy source that generates limitless energy from minuscule amounts of water. Not so in real life. Most proposed fusion reactions generate lots of neutrons, which in turn create radioactivity aplenty. Some possible fusion reactions are aneutronic, mostly or entirely avoiding this problem, but those produce less energy and are technically more challenging to achieve, as if making a viable fusion power plant of any kind weren't hard enough.
<ul><li> While it's true that fusion is not radiation-free, the issue posed by the irradiated material is <em>vastly</em> inferior to fission reactions. Generally only the innards of the reactor become irradiated; given sufficient care, an ideal fusion plant <em>would</em>, from a practical point of view, be "clean". Anyone who stuck their head in the reactor would die gruesomely, but nobody outside the plant itself would need to concern themselves with such issues. Of course, this is also true of fission reactors.
</li><li> It would actually be about the same at the plant itself. The main source of radiation exposure for personnel operating a nuclear reactor is nitrogen-16, which is created when oxygen in water (you still have to cool the thing, and transport energy to your steam turbines somehow) is exposed to neutron flux. Neutrons will also irradiate iron and cobalt atoms in the primary coolant piping, providing the majority of radiation exposure in a shutdown, contaminating the coolant (thus requiring the same control methods needed as in a fission plant), and ensuring that all maintenance tooling and cleaning supplies are low-level nuclear waste (again, same control methods). However, the big difference between fission and fusion in terms of waste is the spent nuclear fuel; the nuclides created by the fusion reaction itself would be short-lived and tame compared to fission products.
</li><li> What WOULD be a perfectly clean energy source would be magnetic confined helium-3 fusion, as its byproduct is protons, rather than neutrons. This has two advantages: 1. A proton flux won't make the walls radioactive because it will be contained by the magnetic field. 2. Since protons are charged, a high energy proton flux IS an electric current, so it can generate electricity directly by induction, rather than requiring a steam plant. This avoids the nitrogen-16 problem and also dramatically increases the efficiency of the generator.

<ol><li> All <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">nuclear technology and material glows</a>. Most often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SicklyGreenGlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SicklyGreenGlow">Sickly Green Glow</a>. It's usually fatal or at least extremely dangerous just to be in the same room as it, regardless of whether it actually would be or not.
<ul><li> Most radioactive materials don't glow at all<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6iq2p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6iq2p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6iq2p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not in visible light.</span>. Swimming pool reactors have a characteristic blue glow that's actually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation">Cherenkov radiation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — pretty, but not caused by the radioactivity itself. Some intensely radioactive substances like actinium, cesium-137, and pure radium metal itself (in large enough quantities), actually do glow <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7cc44');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7cc44" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7cc44');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">technically, self-fluoresce </span> by their own radioactivity and are generally not healthy to be in the same room with. However, even those are faint enough that you can only see the glow in the dark.
<ul><li> Sufficiently hot masses of critical material, such as the fuel pellets for radioisotope thermal generators, do glow, but not out of radiation - merely out of heat. Also, your average picture of a glowing fuel-pellet typically cheats - most such pictures are taken after covering the pellet with a thermal insulator, concentrating its heat enough for the express purpose of making it glow and taking a pretty picture. You'd only be able to see the glow with an infrared-sensitive imager otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> Most radioactive elements are greyish, not green or blue. The most common (non-metallic) color of nuclear material would be from one of the first steps in uranium refinement; yellowcake.
</li><li> The "sickly green glow" idea probably came from the greenish color of the old glow-in-the-dark radium dial wristwatches. Even in this case, though, it isn't the radium that's glowing. The hands and face are painted with a mixture of radium and zinc sulfide; the latter phosphoresces when struck by the high-energy charged particles emitted as the former undergoes radioactive decay.
</li><li> Another source of this idea is probably the "uranium glass", a colored glass very popular in the early 20th century. Its actual color and transparency varies from straw to grass-green, and from slightly dusty to completely opaque, but it invariably glows a solid yellow-green under the UV light.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8s3fd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8s3fd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8s3fd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The uranium glass simply changes the invisible short-wavelength UV light into visible light with a longer wavelength. So do other substances, like some washing powers (to make white clothes look whiter under sunlight).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Any amount of radiation renders an area a physically unapproachable deathtrap for thousands of years. Radiation in videogames might approach lava in terms of lethality (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection">assuming that we're talking about real-world lava rather than video-game lava</a>), or even be used as an ersatz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">Insurmountable Waist-Height Fence</a> to define the edge of a stage.
<ul><li> Anything this insanely radioactive would be decaying so rapidly it wouldn't actually be the same isotope for more than a few minutes. That's what radioactivity <em>means</em>.
</li><li> It's perfectly possible to walk around in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone without dropping dead in seconds or growing a third arm. In the entire 30-kilometer Zone dangerous radiation is limited to two "hot spots" with a total area of 2000 square meters, and 'dangerous' means 'a picnic in this place might result in some radiation poisoning'. The Zone's become an accidental nature reserve. Not everything is roses, of course: the soil closest to the plant contains high levels of uranium (a heavy metal), and the food chain is still full of easily absorbed caesium-137 and strontium-90 (with a half-life of roughly 30 years, which means that even today about half of it remains after the disaster). So while they're mostly free from human interference, animals in the area have reduced lifespans and a high rate of birth defects.
</li><li> People live in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, despite the best efforts of a pair of horribly primitive and inefficient strategic nuclear weapons, and towns near Fukushima (which, despite its seriousness, doesn't hold a candle to Chernobyl in terms of the amount of radiation released) are being cleaned up and reopened on a yearly basis. Weapons that would have left a much larger and more concentrated amount of radioactive fallout than more efficient weapons. This is helped by a benefit of an air burst - if the fireball doesn't touch the surface, fallout is extremely small. If it does touch the surface, though, it's irradiating and vaporizing tons of dirt/water which then go up in smoke... and later come down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Somewhere</a>.

Living organisms simply do not work that way. For starters, where radiation is supposed to "alter" (e.g. damage) DNA/RNA, it would have to introduce the same very specific change in billions, per body cell count, of <em>random</em> events hitting that DNA. Then, as a functioning body actually has far more regulating systems active, it should somehow alter all of them <em>in precisely the same manner</em>, so we do not get an old, boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> set of radiation symptoms like body systems fighting in an attempt to fix each other. And not the least, the amount of radiation doing all that should somehow fail at destroying/damaging every other body chemical but DNA (rendering the whole organism inoperable) or simply frying the subject in the process.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise has been using nukes since its beginning, so this trope has been played with a number of times:
<ul><li> Amazingly enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> averted this: a nuke is launched in one episode, and is then sliced apart by the eponymous Gundam's beam saber. Slicing the nuke <em>does not</em> cause it to explode, but fall to pieces harmlessly, though he does have to cut it a certain way to avoid detonation.
</li><li> Sadly, later series are more inaccurate. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Stardust Memory</a></em> prominently featured a nuclear weapon as a central part of the plot... which did not behave much like an actual nuke would, with the biggest mistake being the GP-02 Physalis Gundam's atomic bazooka firing some sort of energy beam rather than a projectile. It has been suggested that the bazooka is actually a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#Nukes_In_Space~Nuclear_Shaped_Charges">casaba howitzer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a directed energy weapon that utilizes a nuclear-shaped charge to generate a high-energy gamma ray laser and is essentially a hypothetical real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>. However, they still fail in that in order to make a casaba howitzer that small without blowing up the GP-02 in the process, it would have to be made of a material much MUCH stronger than anything currently known to man, and since mobile suits of all makes and models are getting torn apart by simple energy and kinetic weapons, this probably isn't the case.
<ul><li> Or it could be that the "energy beam" is just an animation gimmick to make it easier to see, like how rail guns shoot "yellow beams" or the "Cannons" on the guncannon and guntank shoot glowing bolts of energy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> also features nuclear warheads of the grenade-like variety, but this is justifiable for a few reasons. One, they're at least 2,000 years old, so even if they weren't designed to be triggered by impact, the control mechanisms simply aren't going to be reliable anymore. Two, everyone treats them like grenades because they have no idea what a nuke actually is or how it works; nukes are a weapon out of very bad ancient history, so it's natural to be terrified of them even before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">five of them blow up Gavane Gooney</span>.

Nuclear weapons are banned by a treaty, however all mobile suits have nuclear reactors. A General in the Federation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">keeps sending in mobile suits</a> to a mountain stronghold in the hope that it will get damaged just right to trigger a meltdown and take out the base. The mobile suits in question use Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactors, which should not be melting down but if hit with a beam weapon can explode with great force. The Federation General in question apparently overlooked the relative rarity of beam weapons on Zeon mobile suits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> is guilty of Idea 1. Defunct nuclear reactors are valuable but highly dangerous targets for scavengers... because apparently some idiot(s) left them all running, and if you pull out too many components(or simply damage the cooling tower bad enough) they will explode like bombs. A fight between mobile suits during a raid results in a second sunrise.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em>, the final episode has a runaway robotic tunnel digging machine, uh, digging a tunnel though an active fusion reactor. The secondary police characters were alternating between ranting against and calmly accepting the imminent vaporizing of Mega-Tokyo. To be fair, it was digging very fast, almost a foot per minute.

He shows injuries that look like severe radiation burns, but these are temporary because he has a healing factor. He doesn't show signs of radiation poisoning staying in his body well into modern day, probably because of his healing factor. And he is not disintegrated by "a force equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT" because... healing factor?

Let's see, why is Locke dying? Because he contracted cancer. How did he contract cancer? Because of a lifetime of absorbing Master Emerald radiation interacting badly with his altered DNA. Why is his DNA altered, <em>he experimented on himself to give his then-unborn son Chaos-fueled superpowers.</em> See the problem? The same genes that end up killing him through enhanced radiation sickness are now in Knuckles. Oh, and just to add further insult to this, <em>Locke gave Knuckles' egg a big ol' dose of Master Emerald radiation soon after it was laid</em>. How Knuckles didn't hatch into a stillborn tumor baby, while his dad ended up dying from cancer, despite having the same combination of altered genes and radiation, is anyone's guess.

Evil!Magnus knows this and lampshades it to Platinum seconds before Real!Magnus perceives the situation.

<ul><li> An isotope being so "vollatile" [sic] that it doesn't have a half-life, but a "quarter-life". The "quarter-life" of a radioactive material would be the time taken for the radioactivity of a material to drop to a quarter of its original value; this would be precisely twice the half-life of a material. Furthermore, volatility has nothing to do with radioactivity.

A nuclear bomb is no more powerful than a small pipe bomb ("the nuclear bom went off like a bom") — the worst of the damage is a scratch in Light's dad's car — but covers the area in "radiactiv" (which fatally irradiates "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">Yotsuba</a>" but leaves everyone else unharmed).

First is Dr. Octavius's infamous experimental fusion reactor, and more in line with this trope are the four plutonium batteries he uses to power the tentacles. At one point Octavius mentions that he's rigged a failsafe in them that will deliberately overload the batteries in the event of his death as a way to keep the tentacles from falling into anyone else's hands, essentially making a quartet of small nuclear bombs. Vindictive as he might be, this trope does get averted in that Octavius knows full well that nuclear reactor =/= nuclear bomb and the damage his little batteries would inflict is nowhere near the annihilation of half of Washington DC he threatens.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">Animatrix</a></em>, the scenes that explain how the machine city went to war with humanity has a part that involves humans nuking the shit out of their city. And the narrator says that it doesn't work because the machines "aren't affected by radiation." Ouch. Apparently nukes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a> have no blastwave, and robots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a> are immune to heat and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectroMagneticPulse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectroMagneticPulse">Electro Magnetic Pulse</a> that comes from a nuclear blast. Considering they use EMP as their main weapon against the machines in the movies, it makes even less sense.
<ul><li> '...the machines had little to fear of the bombs' radiation and heat.' The former statement is problematic, the later is very much true. Most of a A-bomb's destruction comes from heat and machines are darned better at surviving that then mere flesh. The radiation? Not really an issue, as thanks to the square law of dissipation it'd only matter if you're close enough to be killed by the blast-wave. "Funfact": armored fighting vehicles still proved surprisingly resilient against both heat and the blast-wave, hence why research focused on increasing the emitted radiation, resulting in the Neutron Bombs.
</li><li> Although the statement about the machines' resilience against heat is generally true, the writers of <em>Animatrix</em> seem to have no idea <em>how much</em> heat does nuclear weaponry actually produce. The temperature near the center of their explosion reaches levels that you can normally meet on stars. To give a small example of their capabilities — during "Trinity" nuclear test, the bomb (with yield equal to "only" 22 kilotons of TNT) was placed on top of a 30-metre tower made of steel, in the middle of a desert. The result? Steel tower <em>vaporized</em> — literally <em>nothing</em> left of it — and sand in about 300 metre radius around the explosion melted and <em>boiled</em>, later congealing into a glassy residue named "trinitite". Now, imagine an entire barrage of a-bombs with many times greater yield than that (nuclear weaponry currently in possession of countries armed with them are much, much more powerful than those built in final days of World War Two) dropped at any city. While the idea of a machine city surviving a single nuclear bomb is plausible, the idea of it tanking a <em>carpet bombing</em> of such warheads (which is what happened to Zero-One) and coming out without a scratch is downright ludicrous.

When the nuclear missile fired by the Nautilus hits the Giant in space, it detonates. This is unlikely: nuclear weapons are specifically designed to only detonate under specific conditions, such as reaching ground level where the Giant originally was. The missile should have just been destroyed.

<ul><li> However, it's mostly averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">the first movie</a>— when the <em>Nostromo</em>'s engines overload, the blast appears as a large circle of light in space, and there is no sound until the shockwave hits the still-too-close escape shuttle.

While a cool scene, apart from the "reactors blow up" fallacy, it also raises the question of the difficulties of building a bridge in such a highly-radioactive area (plus the expense of creating shielded trains) versus just building a detour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> featured a minuscule plutonium powered fission reactor that barely altered the shape of the famous DeLorean time machine, had a 1.21 Gigawatt output (greater than many full-sized nuclear power stations), and expended a fuel rod in an instant.

<ul><li> Averted: After the crash of a Stealth bomber carrying nuclear missiles, it is correctly stated that the warheads cannot be detonated by burning jet fuel.
</li><li> Averted: Chief Rhodes says that he is going to destroy one of the bombs by opening up the access panel and drop a couple of grenades in there. That is a prudent action since it is an intended safety philosophy that nuclear weapons will be rendered harmless if they are tampered with.
</li><li> Averted: <strong>Broken Arrow</strong> is the correct United States military nuclear incident terminology for a nuclear weapon being lost in transit. Curiously the actual incident is an <strong>Empty Quiver</strong>, that is to say theft of nuclear weapons, but the deception by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deakins</span> makes it look like an accident. Or does it?! Because...
</li><li> Played Straight: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deakins</span> has his henchmen act as if they are dying in agony from radiation from damaged weapons. But Plutonium is only mildly radioactive and cannot induce acute radiation sickness.
</li><li> Played Straight: Even assuming Plutonium is highly radioactive, acute radiation sickness takes hours to set in. And when it does you first become nauseous, then you feel all right for several days, and then you die from organ failure. It is not this instant affair that the henchmen put on a big show of.
</li><li> Played straight: And even assuming that acute radiation sickness is an instant killer, then the team - specialized in the recovery of nuclear weapons - would not have run in head first into a hot-spot without detection equipment and protective clothing. No-one would be fooled by the deception because such - supposed - behaviour would be incompetence of the highest order.
</li><li> Played Straight: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hale</span> says they are safe after nuclear explosion in the mine since it was underground. This is false since we see a big fireball that is chock-full of fresh fission by-products. Don't breathe this...
</li><li> Played Straight: The underground nuclear explosion produces an electromagnetic pulse (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP</a>) that knocks out all electronics in the area and makes a helicopter crash. But underground nuclear explosions do not produce this effect. Only atmospheric explosions can cause EMPs. And for the truly spectacular EMPs, those can only be caused by exo-atmospheric nuclear explosions. Finally: the helicopter is too old to be affected by malfunctioning electronics in that manner.
</li><li> Averted: The villain tells his team not to shoot at the warheads. Even if he knows that they will not detonate from this, the admonition is warranted because if the weapons are damaged they will go from being valuable assets to useless junk.
</li><li> Averted: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hale</span> says they will disable the weapons by entering the wrong access codes enough times into the PAL - Permissive Action Links - of the weapon. In real life this would work. But alas...
</li><li> Played Straight: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deakins</span> has removed the access codes to the PAL, so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hale</span> accidentally activates the weapon without any possibility to de-activate it. In real life these codes cannot be disabled, at least not by someone with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deakins</span>'s pay grade and especially not out in the wild.
</li><li> Played Straight: The process of arming a nuclear weapon has several more steps than just authorizing yourself to the weapon. It is not the one-step affair we see in the film. This and the point above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious</a>.
</li><li> And finally, averted, as the train carrying the nuke crashes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the momentum of the crash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">launching the warhead straight into Deakins' chest, through a few walls, and right into an exploding helicopter</a></span> without it detonating.

<ul><li> Averted in that the reactor incident shown toward the beginning of the film is a fairly realistic failure mode for a nuclear reactor from the period. (The partial meltdown at Three Mile Island a few days after the film's release was remarkably similar.)
</li><li> Played straight in that the description of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">the possible effects of a reactor meltdown</a> (including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>) by a so-called expert is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">thinly veiled anti-nuclear screed</a>.

How do they accomplish this? By taking a plutonium bar from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a>'s power generator and <em>placing it right next to the bomb</em>.

The chief engineer informs the Captain that enough seawater mixed with the rocket fuel will cause an explosion and that the warheads will detonate. While an explosion (which did occur in real life) would be catastrophic, there is no chance that the warheads will go nuclear. In real life, submarine was was brought to a nuclear safe condition (as a result of the nuclear reactor not shutting down properly) at the cost of a sailor's life, but the explosion itself caused the submarine and its nuclear complement to sink to a depth of about 18,000 feet.

A rod of Pu that size would weigh at least 50 pounds, which is big enough to be a critical mass. It would be exceptionally hot to the touch, and also would be emitting lots of neutron radiation. To be fair, the villain is both immune to pain and suicidal, so the fact that the rods should be scalding hot and emiiting lethal levels of radiation might actually be excusable. Bond has no such excuse, though.
<ul><li> The reactor of the movie's 1967-vintage nuclear sub had fuel assemblies (that plutonium rod) which could be manually inserted and removed. That's not how a Russian sub reactor is designed (though it is closer to certain heavy water power reactors.) To refuel the sub, they first need to shut down the reactor <em>for 90 days</em> so the fuel is not too hot from a radioactive and thermal standpoint. Then they cut open part of the sub's outside hull to remove the fuel assemblies. Big job, needed once every 5 to 10 years. The bullet stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s brain would have killed him by then and the audience would be quite bored.

Since James Bond doesn't have enough time to delicately disarm, he just attaches some explosives to the tail end of the missile so when the missile ignites to lift off, the flames detonate the explosives, safely blowing the missile to hell. However, the movie does play the trope straight at the beginning, when the top brass is talking about some Soviet nuclear torpedoes detonating or spreading plutonium from their missile strike.

<ul><li> Not only he <em>should</em> know what happens in this case, but he also should know that what's he describes is just plain impossible.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gipsy Danger</span>'s nuclear reactor is repurposed as a nuclear bomb <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to destroy the portal</span>, complete with huge explosion. Usually, that can't happen. It's all but stated, however, that the reactor was deliberately tuned to be used for a nuclear self-destruct, since setting it off can be done fairly easily from the cockpit.
<ul><li> The power source for a Robot has absolutely no relationship to whether it's analog or digital. Raleigh connects the two for no reason.
<ul><li> However, with the later model nuclear Jaegers, it's likely that the electronic systems would be hardened against radiation.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gipsy Danger</span>'s "nuclear reactor" is not a nuclear reactor but something referred to as a "Nuclear Vortex Turbine" that has all the functionality of a fission rocket hooked up to a turbine and generator. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As we all know a rocket is just a slowed down and directed explosion, so it not to much of a stretch for it to be suddenly less controlled.</span> This would also explain numerous other functions of the chest piece such as a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">deceleration rocket</span> or a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">short range wave motion gun</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In an aversion of the trope, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePeacemaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePeacemaker">The Peacemaker</a></em> Nicole Kidman successfully stops an atomic explosion by distorting a piece of the explosive jacket surrounding the plutonium core, resulting in a small (if a bit dirty) conventional explosion because it wasn't shaped properly. This is exactly right.
<ul><li> At the beginning of the movie, a train carrying nuclear weapons explodes when it hits another train head on. The heroes point out that shouldn't happen, as modern warheads have numerous safeties. As one character puts it: "You can fire a pistol right at the warhead and it wouldn't go off." In fact, the bad guys rigged a nuke still on the train to blow.
</li><li> The movie also correctly illustrates that most thermonuclear weapons consist of a primary fission charge and a secondary fusion fuel package. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> removes the latter to make the weapon light enough to carry. (Though the elements are significantly larger and heavier in real life.)
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> features a <em>extremely</em> silly depiction of fusion power so Doc Ock's tentacles take control of his body (they're to manipulate the fusions!). Highlights include Doc Ock saying there's only 25 pounds of tritium in the world, a deeply ridiculous open-sided reactor, and dropping an object established to be a miniature sun<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10oz85');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10oz85" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10oz85');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can tell it's a miniature sun because it has a miniature photosphere with miniature sunspots, and the occasional miniature prominence or flare</span> into a river where it, um, goes out harmlessly. Because fusion plasma does that.
<ul><li> The typical fusion reactor has the plasma in a vacuum to prevent heat loss and to keep the assembly from being vaporized. Ock's design doesn't, which would have killed everybody in the room, even if it had been functioning perfectly. The tentacles would have been melted, if not vaporized, on contact with the plasma.
</li><li> Prior to being quenched by the river, the miniature sun is shown acting as a tremendously powerful magnet, pulling in girders of the building it is contained in and instantly consuming them in its plasma. However, iron requires rather than produces energy by fusion. In contrast, water, being composed of light elements, is more likely to fuel a fusion process, and since it was solid as it entered the miniature sun, it would have cooled the system and reduced the fusion reaction rate. So something that would have instantly snuffed out the miniature sun is depicted as making it more powerful, while something that would have made it more powerful makes it fizzle.
<ul><li> Quenching in the river is also ridiculous - as anyone who has passed a nuclear cooling tower knows that quenching that kind of fire should have caused a tremendous amount of dangerously hot steam. The energy can't just "go away".
</li></ul></li><li> The amount of tritium claimed isn't too silly, although the number given is a little low. As of the late 1990s, the USA had only produced a total of 225 kg of tritium since its nuclear program began, and with a half-life of only 12 years, most of that no longer exists. In the cleanup following the Fukishima disaster, release of large amounts of tritium into the environment was a worry - the site was estimated to contain less than 2.5 <em>grams</em> in total, which was still considered a lot.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a></em>, Superman drops Nuclear Man into the cooling tower of a nuclear power plant... and he somehow ends up inside the reactor (which should be located in a different building). Which somehow ends up destroying Nuclear Man.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwarm">The Swarm</a></em>, a horde of killer bees gets into a nuclear power plant. This somehow causes the plant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">go critical</a> and go up in a gigantic explosion (within seconds!). <em>Without</em> killing the bees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorFromTheYear5000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorFromTheYear5000">Terror from the Year 5000</a></em> has an archeologist use carbon-14 dating to determine that a <em>metal</em> statue came from the <em>future</em>. And when he and another guy hold a Geiger counter over the statue, they are shocked to learn that it's incredibly radioactive. Seeing as carbon-14 is a <em>radioactive isotope</em>, you'd think they would have noticed this earlier...
<ul><li> Also you can't use C14 dating on non organic substances (sometimes works on pottery because straw was used to reinforce unfired pots). C14 is built up in living organisms then decays after the organism dies, so assuming the statue was organic its age would be dated from its creation regardless of time travel. Uranium dating would have avoided all these problems.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note119stc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note119stc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note119stc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though the error bars on uranium dating are a lot bigger than ~3000 years, so a reasonable scientist would likely just conclude that a date in the future just meant the item was made "recently" ... within the last couple of million years. This is not especially useful, unless they suspect it wasn't made by humans.</span>
</li><li> On top of all that, the film exaggerates the precision of carbon dating. In real life it doesn't produce <em>a</em> year but an approximation, normally worded as a year plus or minus some number.
</li></ul></li><li> Another surprising aversion in the comedy/action flick <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marine Harriers attack a trio of nuke-carrying trucks. One of them asks for confirmation that the missiles won't set off the nukes, and Schwarzenegger's character assures them that they won't. His expression to his partner after he says this, however, indicates he isn't as sure of this as he sounds. Since he is telling them to go ahead, he probably is aware that even if it <em>is</em> possible, it's extremely unlikely, and a chance well worth taking, weighed against the potential harm of the trucks getting away.
</li><li> It should be noted that about a minute before the bomb detonates, law enforcement officers told people not to look in its direction, and the pilots of the Harriers landed their planes and shut down the engines, while Schwarzenegger holds his hand over his eye so he could not see the blast in his peripheral vision.
</li></ul></li><li> Also surprisingly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFateOfTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFateOfTheFurious">The Fate of the Furious</a></em>, which otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">breaks every physics law in existence</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The submarine porting nuclear missiles doesn't explode in a nuclear blast when it's destroyed by heatseeker, and Tej even points out that the missiles aren't dangerous without being armed</span>.

Jordan Tate asks, "Won't the bombs detonate?"; he tells her: "It doesn't work that way; they will just sink".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolverine">The Wolverine</a></em>: Yashida stares directly into the flash of an atomic bomb and suffers no ill-effects. He should have been burned severely or at the very least blinded on the spot, which would have made it a lot harder to run for the well. His survival of the following explosion and radiation is somewhat more plausible, due to distance and detonation factors (an air-burst detonation leaves relatively little fallout), but still rather unlikely given he waited until the blast had practically caught up to them. At the same time, his survival at all is not completely out of the bounds of credibility: There are confirmed survivors of the Hiroshima bombing who were within the main blast epicenter zone, one of whom was only 170 meters away from the detonation point at the time of the explosion (the man was, however, inside a reinforced basement).
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein">Young Einstein</a></em>, when Einstein attempts to add bubbles to beer by splitting the <em>beer atom</em>... with a chisel. Eventually he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">succeeds</a>, and an exterior shot lets us watch his shack explode.
<ul><li> He goes on to <em>top</em> this by <em>stopping a runaway nuclear reaction</em> by <em>hooking up an electric guitar to the reactor</em> and playing it at insanely high decibels to bleed off the energy. "<em>IT'S ALL RIGHT MARY! ... THEY'RE ONLY ELECTRONS!</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> Use of stock footage from nuclear tests is very common in B-movies; these will typically include vertical smoke lines, even when the weapon is supposed to be a battlefield deployment.
<ul><li> For those who don't know, those smoke lines are from rockets that were launched during nuclear tests to measure the path of the shock front.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Testament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Testament">Testament</a></em> featured a "harmless flash." If you are close enough to see the flash in such a way, you're likely being burned up in it. Nuclear flashes are <em>not</em> just harmless pretty or scary light - they are intense heat. That said, the scarier thing about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Testament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Testament">Testament</a></em> is the implication that it <em>wasn't</em> close at all (e.g. no damage, no immediate fires)... and still was that bright.
<ul><li> Stop, Drop and Roll educational films told the same story. When you see the flash, jump to the curb and hide your face. Then when it's clear you can get up and walk away. No searing heat, no pressure wave, no radiation, no post-apocalyptic zombie world.
<ul><li> When the proper action would have been to <em>dive for the nearest shade</em> or least flammable thing in sight. See above.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeRetaliation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeRetaliation">G.I. Joe: Retaliation</a></em> all the nukes in the world are fired but all were aborted (exploded) short of their intended targets ignores the fact that they just essentially detonated thousands of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bomb">dirty bombs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the upper atmophere all over the earth. All that undetonated fissile material (It <em>doesn't</em> get destroyed or become unradioactive in a non-nuclear explosion), will be spread out and drift down to earth, polluting the planet.
<ul><li> Then again this is part of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cobra's evil plan</span> so its probably understandable in that the people behind it don't really care as it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinWinEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinWinEnding">Win-Win Ending</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">very horrifically</a> during Sarah's nightmare in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>. James Cameron actually received fan mail from actual scientists thanking and praising him for his depiction of a nuclear explosion. The <em>only thing</em> it got wrong was the image of Sarah's skeleton staying behind after the blast wave hits her. Everything else, from Los Angeles crumbling to people bursting into flames and blasting apart into carbonized dust? Pretty damn accurate.
<ul><li> Ironically, the trope is later played straight at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys">Terminator Genisys</a></em>. A nuke goes off over San Francisco as just a flash of light and a pressure wave. No sign of a thermal pulse or anything catching fire until the wave hits. One character even stares <em>directly</em> at the explosion without a hint of pain in his eyes. The streets also conveniently empty themselves of people when the blast wave hits.

<ul><li> Averted in the first of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWar">World War</a></em> novels, when the Germans use the the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">80-cm Dora railway artillery</a> to destroy two alien ships, one of which holds the Race's nukes. The nukes' detonators go off, but no nuclear explosions occur, as the bombs are deformed by the ship exploding. However, the explosion does spread radioactive material over a large area.
<ul><li> Also in the first book, one of the first things The Race does when they arrive on Earth is to set off a number of nuclear detonations in the atmosphere, so that the EMPs produced will short out Earth electronics. They do not produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NuclearWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NuclearWeapons">mushroom clouds</a> when they go off.
</li><li> It also, quite realistically, didn't help them much, because this was, well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">1941</a></em>. Thus the "Earth electronics" were vacuum-tubes based, and these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">tend to shrug off the EMP</a> because of the way they work and generally being quite crude, generally simply requiring restarting at worst, the while the much more sophisticated, but flimsy solid-state electronics would be permanently fried.

In a realistic aversion, the reactor core doesn't explode, but simply melts through the reactor vessel and the ship's hull, causing it to sink.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LesterDelRey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LesterDelRey">Lester del Rey</a>'s 1956 novel <em>Nerves</em> features a nuclear reactor where nuclear isotope production is discussed in terms that sound considerably more like chemistry than nuclear physics: they talk about isotopes "reacting" with each other in such a way as to neutralize both of them, for example.
</li><li> Hans Dominik's novel <em>Atomgewicht 500</em> ("Atomic Weight 500") similarly presents the creation of a super-heavy isotope that unlike the rather less stable intermediate material it's ultimately derived from is pretty much inert in and of itself but will conveniently start to give off energy if brought into contact with water as relatively easy if you only have the know-how and an excellent lab. In its defense, the story <em>was</em> written in 1935.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>:
<ul><li> Averted in Heinlein's short story "The Long Watch". The protagonist prevents a nuclear attack on the Earth by military forces on the Moon by taking the bombs (which are Little Boy style "gun barrel" devices, rather than the Fat Man type of "implosion device" more often featured in fiction) apart and smashing their plutonium cores with a hammer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the process, he exposes himself to enough radiation to reduce his lifespan to a matter of hours....</span>, which is again realistic (although the absence of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">radiation sickness</span> is not).
<ul><li> The narration is too vague to definitely point the type of the bombs described, but plutonium simply <em>doesn't work</em> in gun-type devices due to the pre-ignition issues: it is practically impossible to separate the weapons-grade Pu-239 isotope from the heavier and more reactive 240 and 241 isotopes, which would make a gun-type device to <em>fizzle</em>. Thus plutonium is only used in implosion-type warheads (which are more practical anyway, if more complex).
</li></ul></li><li> Heinlein sets up a blatant type 1 error in "Blowups Happen," a story where power is generated at a nuclear plant where <em>tons</em> of plutonium is kept just below critical mass. Any failure is going to be catastrophic, and the operators know it. The author gets a pass, though, because he wrote this in <em>1940</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">two years before</a> anyone (Enrico Fermi, for that matter) had built a nuclear reactor.

Gunners are trained to burn out the missile's electronics, at which point the hydrogen-tipped missile becomes nothing more than a hunk of falling metal. Also in the novel, the protagonists fight back at Earth by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">throwing rocks</a> at them; an early example of mass drivers. The explosions caused by the rocks smashing into the Earth caused some to declare that the Loonies are dropping nuclear bombs. Even a few members of the Lunar government are confused, stating that it certainly looked like a nuclear bomb went off. Mannie, the protagonist, explains that they did the cosmic equivalent of striking flint to create sparks. And, as stated in the description for this trope, any sufficiently large explosion is going to result in a mushroom cloud.

<div class="indent"><strong>Gaudior:</strong> You know some of the possibilities if your planet is blown up. <br/><strong>Charles Wallace:</strong> It just might throw off the balance of things, so that the sun would burst into a supernova.
</div></li><li> In John Ringo's <em>Legacy of the Aldenata</em> series, specifically in novel Hell's Faire, there is a new nuclear-like weapon. It is described as having its primary radioactive isotope scattered in the area of effect, carbon-13, as having a very fast half-life. The trouble is, carbon-13 has no half-life at all because it is a stable isotope. (Carbon-14, on the other hand, <em>is</em> radioactive, if only very slightly; its half-life is on the order of five thousand years. Such a long half-life implies a very low decay rate, and consequently complete unsuitability for use in any kind of 'dirty bomb' application.)

One microton is just one gram, or approximately three one-hundredths of an ounce — or, in other words, since we're talking about yields in terms of TNT-equivalent, barely a firecracker's worth of bang, and that's if we're being generous. In theory, it would be possible to produce a nuclear explosion out of such a tiny mass of fissile material, by increasing its density enough to drive it supercritical — trouble is, there's no point; <em>The Forever War</em> is set in the future, and today we know how to make <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raufoss_Mk_211">chemical-explosive rounds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which produce quite a bit more than a firecracker's worth of bang.

Wells</a>'s novel <em>The World Set Free</em> (1914) features what may be the first-ever appearance of atomic explosives anywhere, but considering that it was written at the tail-end of the Victorian Era, the physics are quite dodgy. Extrapolating from the idea of radioactive decay as something with a tremendous amount of energy-releasing it over a long period of time, Wells' nukes work by somehow speeding up this process. Instead of releasing all of its nuclear energy in an instantaneous, massive explosion, the bomb speeds up radioactive decay to the point where you have a huge fireball that hangs around for several days before dying down.

<ul><li> The "radiation is lava" trope is taken <em>literally</em> with an iodine-131-contaminated corpse burning up from radiation exposure.

</li><li> Following from the point above, they use chemical means to investigate the juice and get it doubly wrong because not only does I-131 <strong>not</strong> turn to regular iodine, but xenon... and since that is a noble gas it cannot be detected in the manner shown.
</li><li> A person who is fatally poisoned by radioactive materials is allowed to roam free in public. That doesn't happen, ever. Even people treated with medical doses of I-131 are kept in the hospital ward until their "glow" fades, and the staff is made to wear lead aprons around them to keep the exposure to a minimum.

</div><ul><li> The idea of random radiation exposure suddenly shrinking a tumor without causing any other symptoms is ridiculous.
</li><li> While it's true that everything electrical gives off radiation, it's radio frequency EM radiation and not <em>ionizing</em> radiation, which is the kind a Geiger counter picks up (or would have any chance of affecting cancer). The only electrical devices in a home that produce any ionizing radiation are smoke detectors (which contain a tiny amount of mostly alpha-emitting americium-241) and CRT displays (that produce soft Bremsstrahlung x-rays from electrons hitting the phosphor).

Johnny and Jerry stand within several feet of the blast and even look up at the fireball and aren't even physically mutilated from the heat and force of the blast. Giant Robo can also just sap nuclear energy like a sponge which, while explaining why Johnny and the others haven't died of radiation poisoning, still is hard to believe a robot can just suck out any form of nuclear energy and not suffer the effects from Electro-Magnetic Pulse.

</li><li> Finch detects "alpha particle emissions" while just holding his probe up into the air. Nevermind that he wouldn't be able to distinguish alpha radiation from any other kind of ionizing radiation - alpha particles have a range in air of only centimeters, so if he was detecting them that way, it would mean that the alpha emitter was <em>in the air</em> and he was breathing in airborne contamination. Ouch.
</li><li> Upon being told that it's alpha radiation, Reese immediately concludes that "it's polonium", instead of the other hundreds of possible alternatives.
</li><li> Ingesting polonium means that radiation poisoning sets in immediately, and is invariably fatal within 24 hours. In real life, the first symptoms (read: nausea) wouldn't set in for many hours, and death would take weeks. Furthermore, if you knew early on that you had ingested polonium, there's a good chance that chelation treatment could save your life.

</li><li> Any implausibilities about nuclear weapons and radiation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a>: Hell on Earth</em> can be easily explained away with one phrase: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">supernatural nuclear reactions</a>." Yes, radiation <em>does</em> glow green, but that might only be because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">everyone expects it to</a>. Yes, there <em>are</em> rules governing the detonation of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutronBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutronBomb">G-Ray Bomb</a>," but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">only one</a> governing conventional nukes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> mostly averts these, but flirts with 1 and 3 a little. To wit: BattleMechs and many other vehicles are powered by fusion engines. By the core game rules, damaging those enough will simply cause them to shut down, disabling the unit. So far, so good. However, because some BattleTech <em>fiction</em>, notably novels by Michael Stackpole, featured breached 'Mech reactors spontaneously and dramatically exploding every so often (in fact, "Stackpoling" became fan-speak for exploding reactors), an optional rule allowing for this to happen if desired also exists based strictly on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> (its lack of realism is explicitly noted).
<ul><li> A fluff piece in the Tech Manual sourcebook explains away the BattleMech reactor explosions as the effects of air hitting the inside of a very hot reactor vessel combined with ammunition and other volatile components detonating as well. Another in-universe fusion reactor explosion is also shown to be the result of a roof collapse dropping tons of snow upon the reactor's liquid sodium cooling system. The narrator noted the reactor was almost an innocent bystander.

</li><li> The M42 "Fat Man" tactical nuclear catapult is the unholy spawn of a PIAT and a Davey Crockett, a man-portable nuclear artillery platform that pneumatically launches a warhead about the size of an American football. Like the cars, the warhead gives off a mushroom cloud when it explodes.
</li><li> Ghouls are people who somehow survived exposure to a massive dose of radiation, like that of a strategic nuclear weapon, and become immune to the damaging effects of radiation. Instead, high radiation levels cause them to regenerate. On the other hand, they end up looking like zombies and some suffer mental degradation and become feral. The transformation usually occurs gradually after exposure to large amounts of background radiation over time, though a sudden massive dose can induce the transformation far faster (Moira Brown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> if you detonate the bomb in Megaton and the NCR soldiers at Searchlight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">New Vegas</a></em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> introduces two ghouls who induced the condition in themselves through radiation experiments and a vaguely-described serum respectively.

</li><li> In <em>Fallout 4</em>, the residents of Vault 111 descends to the Vault just as a nuclear explosion goes off in the distance. Realistically, they all should have received at least major burns over much of their bodies from the thermal pulse.
</li><li> <em>Fallout 4</em> also has a pocket nuclear sub with one remaining missile in a hidden submarine base. You can launch the missile which farts around the concrete ceiling of the base for a few seconds (If you read your quest log at this point, your character has apparently written in it "I just set off a nuclear bomb! <em>Why am I still reading this?!</em>") and will explode, killing everyone in the base in a white flash, but not even knocking the outside door over. If you've run out of the area, as soon as you zone out of the door you are perfectly safe, not even radiation escapes.

<ul><li> In some games in the series, nuclear reactors could be built in your cities for extra production, but they had a small chance to <em>spontaneously explode</em> (in Civ 4, with the full impact of a thermonuclear missile!).

In retrospect, they probably should have put a <em>containment dome</em> over those reactors or something. <em>Sim City 4</em> plays it dead straight though: an exploding nuclear plant creates a huge blue mushroom cloud, a massive crater and a big shockwave that can flatten half your city.

<ul><li> Exploding Nuclear reactors or weapons:
<ul><li> One of the Soviet missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a></em> takes place in a nuclear power plant that the Allies have sabotaged. Your technicians must activate the cooling systems on the reactor before the core melts down. However, if you fail, the game shows a video of an exploding atomic bomb, which is not the same thing <em>at all</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Red Alert: The Aftermath</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em> the Demolition Truck produces a nuclear explosion when destroyed. While they may have designed it to do this you think they would wait to arm it until they got it away from their own base. In <em>Red Alert 2</em> destroying the Soviet nuclear reactor causes a large explosion. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a></em> series includes the Chinese, with nuclear superweapons, a smaller war-head siege weapon, and a forest of nuclear power plants that can be (you guessed it) set off in a chain reaction of tiny atomic explosions. If the players purchase the nuclear tank upgrade to make their tanks move faster their tanks will explode if destroyed.
</li><li> Honorable mention: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Red Alert 3</a></em>, the Soviet Super reactor will cause a massive explosion when destroyed, which can destroy most units if they're too close - despite nukes canonically <em>not having been invented yet</em>. (What do the plants run on? "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">Chemicals.</a>") Funnier still, it sports a nuclear symbol and a small chamber from which Cherenkov radiation leaks.
</li><li> In the Chinese campaign in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals">Generals</a></em> the GLA uses a Chinese nuclear missile as a standstill bomb.
</li></ul></li><li> Weak Nukes
<ul><li> In a few games in the series (notably the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Red Alert</a></em>), nuclear missiles could barely destroy <em>a tent</em> when dropped right on it. Later games (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn</a></em>) had much more powerful nukes (Nod's nuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars">Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</a></em> can punch a pretty good hole in a base).
</li><li> Speaking of <em>C&amp;C3</em>, it features a Nod mission where the player must steal several nuclear warheads with a pretty pathetic force guarding them. If the player attacks the trucks the warheads detonate into a mushroom cloud. Hilariously, it doesn't even seem that the trucks themselves carry the active nukes; should one be killed, the game automatically drops a nuclear missile on it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">What.</a>
</li><li> For the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Red Alert</a></em>, its somewhat true - however that is only for multiplayer, where a nuclear weapon hit the square targeted, then two squares out in a ring around the target. In short, some units standing <em>next</em> to a nuclear explosion could take <em>no damage at all</em>. In Singleplayer, if a nuke is fired, it does not only cause the white flash, but vaporize everything in the blast radius. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Tiberian Dawn</a></em> was similar, in that a missile launched from the Temple would obliterate anything.
</li><li> The Apocalypse tank in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em> can be upgraded with experience to fire nuclear ammunition, causing small mushroom clouds about the size of a tank but not necessarily killing anything in the vicinity. Infantry are notorious for surviving direct hits from tank shells. This is about as realistic as Tesla bombs dropped from the veteran Kirov airship that produces an <em>electrical</em> explosion. Oh wait, this is <em>Red Alert</em> we are talking about here, the universe where reality takes a backseat to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">coolness</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Fission equals Fusion:
<ul><li> Cold Fusion Reactors (in itself impossible under current physics understanding) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals">Generals</a></em> and <em>Zero Hour</em> have Control Rods like Fission Plants. Heightening them (which <em>costs money</em>) enhances the power output by 100% (300% for Superweapon General). At least these reactors don't explode, unlike their Chinese fission counterparts.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion">Maniac Mansion</a></em> may end badly with the nuclear reactor in the mansion's basement melting down — which causes a mushroom cloud explosion obliterating everything in a five-mile radius.
</li><li> Averted somewhat in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaLoMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaLoMania">Mega Lo Mania</a></em> (<em>Tyrants: Fight Through Time</em>) a nuke will destroy a sector unless you have nuclear defense turrets to shoot it down, the sector then becomes uninhabitable.
</li><li> Very nicely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentStorm">Hammer and Sickle</a></em> when, in the next to last mission, the main character says something like "When we find the nuke, just shoot it, or throw grenades at it." When the other characters complain that it's going to blow, he tells them getting a nuke to go off is a very difficult process, and that it's very unlikely that the bad guys ship it around armed and ready to go off. You get a nice dose of radiation poisoning that quite quickly drains your hit points though.
</li><li> "Fallout" is used as a substitute for walls in the Chernobyl stage of <em>Call of Duty 4: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>.
</li><li> Most games of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a>'s</em> era tended to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">open pools of radioactive waste</a> as a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimyWater">hurt floor</a>, typically shown as being slightly less dangerous than lava. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> the toxic waste is called nukage and is stored in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrel">Exploding Barrel</a> drums; the game booklet describes the damaging floors as "slime and other radioactive waste". There are radioactive warning signs, while the radiation shielding suit, Toxin Refinery, and Nuclear Plant maps suggest Union Aerospace Corporation was operating a nuclear power plant and waste handling facility on Phobos.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> games feature Phazon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> substance so ridiculously radioactive that it can kill someone wearing a sealed, armored spacesuit in less than a minute. It's apparently also <em>stable</em>. It's apparently also organic, biological, and sentient making it's "radiation" more like some kind of unique bioenergy field people can siphon off. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Given that it's actually the material component of a hyperdimensional intelligent entity whose main body is a <em>planet</em>, there might be more to it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> features several variants of battlefield nuclear weapon; all produce the "columns of smoke" effect that would only normally be seen in a nuclear test.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a>: Utsuho gets a lot of traditional nuclear reactor and meltdown imagery and symbolism despite only having power over <em>fusion</em> and not <em>fission</em>. Also, the radiation issues are completely ignored in gameplay.
<ul><li> She has power over both fusion and fission. She has two unique shoes on each foot — the right one is a rock called the Foot of Fusion, while the left is just a black shoe with a model of an atom floating around it called the Foot of Fission. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Arm Cannon</a>, called Third Leg, controls both (it's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>). She just uses fusion more often. Her power is based on solar fusion, not deuterium-tritium fusion; heavy hydrogen has neutrons to give off during fusion, while solar fusion uses protium hydrogen which has no neutrons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earth2150" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earth2150">Earth 2150</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">United Civilized States</a> forces use nuclear reactors to power their bases. When a reactor is destroyed, it blows up like a nuclear missile, wiping out half of the UCS base... wait no, the explosion is <em>completely harmless</em>. At the beginning of the game, the Eurasians destroyed the nuclear stockpile of UCS on Alaska, and the explosion from it was so powerful that it knocked Earth off its orbit, and slowly send it to the sun.
</li><li> Averted and played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon">Heavy Weapon</a></em>. Attacking the atomic bombs that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Atomic Bomber</a> drop will result in the bomb being destroyed (and not exploding), saving your ass from an otherwise-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">unavoidable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.

Yet somehow it's supposed to bring down alien technology.
</li><li> In <em>F/A-18 Hornet</em>, the B-57 tac-nuke is said to have a 20-kiloton yield, the same as the Hiroshima bomb, but only has a blast radius of 2,500 feet, less than half of that of Little Boy. Another gross error occurs in the mission "Neighbors" from the <em>F/A-18 Korea</em> expansion pack, where dropping a conventional bomb on a launch silo triggers the nuclear warhead.

If an opposing Ace Pilot blocks the charge in flight... it squibs and drops to the ground harmlessly, like real-world nukes will if they aren't exposed to the G-forces of a complete flight path.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> features a mission where the player squadron must fly cover over an isolated location where a group of students and intellectuals is trying to dismantle a nuclear weapon so it can never be used. The dismantling is being done by a physics grad student, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot">being the most qualified person available</a>. This event is treated as a very delicate operation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">something in which any wrong move might inadvertently set off the warhead</a>, giving everyone in the area a scare when they think it is starting up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a> aside, they could probably have just torn the thing to pieces with spanners, crowbars, and industrial saws without worry since it takes a lot of deliberate effort to get something like that to arm, let alone detonate.
<ul><li> Partly justified as the player is in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanyonChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanyonChase">canyon</a> trying to keep the enemy forces AWAY from the group dismantling the nuke in question (which they can't even see to begin with), while most of the people working on the thing have likely never even <em><strong>seen</strong></em> a nuke let alone taken one apart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">If the resistance had someone who knew a thing or two about nuclear weapons on the scene, the mission would've been over within a couple of minutes of the players squadron arriving on the scene.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> series averts this trope, Nuclear missiles will explode and deal plenty of damage, but can be shot down safely with interceptor missiles.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> mod Industrial Craft 2 has nukes and nuclear reactors. The explosion from a nuclear reactor is actually bigger than that of a nuke. Also, due to interaction with vanilla Minecraft's poisoning mechanics, you can cure radiation poisoning by drinking milk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em> features an anti-radiation hypo that is stated to "accelerate the half-life breakdown" of radioactive elements in the body. This would most likely simply increase the activity of the sample, so the exposure time would decrease, but the damage done to the body would increase as well.
</li><li> <em>Sub-Terrania</em> by Zyrinx has a nuclear reactor that resembles a large spiked ball.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em>, set in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> universe, carries over many of the boardgame's nuclear whoopsies. The fusion reactors in battlemechs have infinite range, their only limiting factor being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating">Over Heating</a> from firing weapons. Depending on the game, reactors can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">go critical</a> when the mech is destroyed, with varying degrees of destruction; in <em>Mechwarrior 4</em> all mechs explode in a small blue fireball when destroyed, while in <em>Living Legends</em> destroyed mechs have a 20% chance to erupt in a massive mushroom cloud that can level forests and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">temporarily short out electronics</a>. However, most games do not feature these critical meltdowns and destroying the reactor simply disables the mech through power loss or ammo explosions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TheBottomOfTheWell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TheBottomOfTheWell">The Bottom of the Well</a></em> is towards the realistic end of the spectrum; a lot of the tropes commonly wheeled out for nuclear apocalypses are absent. For example: no glowing green stuff (but plenty of grey radioactive ash); electronics being affected by an EMP; harm from prolonged radiation exposure rather than people immediately melting; no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">Nuclear Nasties</a>.
</li><li> Early beta <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starbound">Starbound</a></em> had uranium and plutonium as minable resources, which were green and pink respectively and safe to handle, but removed them before the full release. The megamod <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrackinUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrackinUniverse">Frackin Universe</a></em> puts them back in, along with neptunium and thorium, and several fictional substances like irradium and ultronium. While the solid versions of these are also safe to handle, immersing yourself in liquid irradium is a very, very bad idea, as you will die in seconds without protection.

A united communist Korea, however, takes the cake when it successfully completes a bomb called the Glorious People's Revolutionary Hammer in 1970, which has a yield of <strong>250,000 megatons</strong> or 250 gigatons. This is virtually impossible to achieve from a logistical and engineering perspective. In OTL the largest nuclear device ever built was Tsar Bomba, which had a maximum theoretical yield of 100 megatons but was detonated with a yield of 50 megatons. If every nuke ever constructed were detonated at once, it would only yield about 4.8 gigatons. Even Edward Teller's theoretical Backyard Bomb, which would be powerful enough to destroy entire countries, would only reach 10 gigatons.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Godfellas", the microscopic Shrimpkins make working microscopic H-bombs, complete with tiny mushroom clouds (in space, no less).
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetandThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetandThePlaneteers">Captain Planet</a></em> — the one with the equally hilarious stand-in for Hitler — when a nuclear weapon detonates with a mushroom cloud <em>in space</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Let's start with the 90-gallon drums full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorScience">green, glowy nuclear waste</a> and work our way out from there...
<ul><li> Considering every episode opens with Homer taking off his radiation suit in the middle of a supposedly radioactive environment, getting a radioactive isotope of some sort jammed in his shirt, then casually tossing said piece of radioactive material out on the street, its safe to say that realism is not high on the list of priorities for the writers.
</li><li> When Sideshow Bob tries to destroy Springfield with an expired nuclear bomb, we're treated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">a tiny mushroom cloud smaller than the bomb itself</a>.
</li><li> Then there's the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror">Treehouse of Horror</a></em> episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E4TreehouseOfHorrorVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E4TreehouseOfHorrorVIII">The Homega Man</a></em> where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutronBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutronBomb">Neutron Bomb</a> hits Springfield and turns everyone who wasn't killed (or protected by lead based paint) into mutants instantly. Not to mention, not only those reduced to skeletons had their clothes still somewhat intact but the buildings of town seem to have foundationally survived as well.
</li><li> In the <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E1TreehouseOfHorrorXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E1TreehouseOfHorrorXV">The Ned Zone</a></em>, Homer blows up the power plant by simply pressing a button- implying that <em>the plant has a self-destruct mechanism</em>. The explosion did show a little bit more realism than <em>The Homega Man</em> in Ned's future vision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that became true despite Ned's efforts</span> by showing what would be left of Springfield after a nuclear explosion, nothing more than a newly formed crater (though, no shockwave, fallout or nearby fires were created from the explosion).
</li><li> Homer also managed to cause a meltdown in a nuclear testing site that contained <em>no nuclear material at all</em>
</li><li> And on <em>at least</em> two occasions, Homer has actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">eaten</a> radioactive material (the aforementioned waste as a punishment from Mr. Burns and the plutonium he attempted to use as fertilizer in "E-I-E-I-(annoyed grunt)")...and survived, with no ill effects.
</li><li> In one episode Mr Burns erects a sign that describes the state of the power plant outside the sign. Homer accurately jokes to his coworkers that if there really is a meltdown, there won't be enough power in the system to power the sign to give out the 'Meltdown in progress: Evacuate' message. Nobody mentions that if there really is a critical meltdown, it would likely be too late for evacuation to do any good to anyone close enough to read the sign even if there was power.
</li><li> The plant has been repeatedly shown to produce not only nuclear waste, but also noxious smog. The only gas that normally comes out of nuclear power plants is <em>steam</em>. Of course, that assumes a well-running, up-to-code power plant, which the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">far from being</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, XANA's plot of the week is to cause a nuclear power plant to explode with a surge of electricity. Most power grids are, well, wired as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">grid</a></em>, meaning it's impossible to cause a precision surge of electricity as the episode implies. The nuclear reactor itself is just a heat source for a heat engine, so even if the wires didn't melt, the actual result would be that the turbines at the plant would be trashed and the reactor would go through a precautionary auto-SCRAM. And this does not even consider the impedance of the power grid. In real life, the power grid cannot even provide enough energy to start up a nuclear plant (gas turbine generators are transported to a nuclear power plant when it needs a "cold boot").
</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> series manages to get nuclear explosives right. One of the turtles manages to keep the nuclear part of an implosion bomb from activating... but the conventional explosion still goes off, to little more than a decent blast — it's actually explained that this will not result in a full-scale nuclear detonation. It's not specifically identified as an implosion bomb, but that's the type this could actually happen with.
</li><li> Odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion">subversion</a> of the "All mushroom clouds are caused by nuclear blasts" idea with the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> short <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAround">Dragon Around</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> and Chip 'N' Dale. In the end, Donald tries to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> blow up the stump with dynamite</span> but instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is blown sky-high several times over in subsequent mushroom cloud blasts.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>'s short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour">Godzilla</a></em> cartoon, there's an episode where, no joke, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTimeTravelIsDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTimeTravelIsDifferent">exposure to uranium sends the protagonists back in time</a>. <em>To <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs">prehistoric times.</a></em>
<ul><li> Even better: How do they get back? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">By grabbing piles of uranium in their hands and molding them into balls!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1996 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> episode "Walkabout", the nano-robotics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Matrix</a> gets loose as the Avalon Travellers show up. When Dr. Reynard mentions that they (Gargoyles and humans) have to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">ever-expanding</a> Matrix before it reaches the nuclear reactor, she points to... the cooling towers. Then the Matrix is talked into stopping before it gets its slimy tendrils into the reactor by... engulfing the cooling towers. At this point, it had covered/absorbed every bit of the research complex except the towers. Yep.
</li><li> The backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> involves an ostensible nuclear apocalypse whose long-term effects in the world's subsequent recovery have eventually amounted to what is for all intents and purposes a whimsical (and in some places <em>literal</em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowl</a>. It could actually be described as a similar, yet <em>vastly</em> more cartoonish, case to that of the <em>Fallout</em> series in terms of fantastical mutations and other evolutionary effects. This is justified by the fact that the Mushroom War also explicitly involved weaponized sorcery, but still.
