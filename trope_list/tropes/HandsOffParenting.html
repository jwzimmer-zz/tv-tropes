<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat">Skip Beat!</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's implied that the super-serious Kanae "Moko" Kotonami is the product of such a style of parenting, leaving her as the de facto adult at her home... despite the fact that she has at least two older, married siblings, if only because they are repeating the same hand off style with their respective families.
</li><li> A more tragic example would be our heroine, Kyouko, whose mother simply doesn't care enough to be a mother.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinRevolution">Penguin Revolution</a></em>, Yukari's father is like this, just before the full fledged parental abandonment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Jiraiya takes this to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> in regards to his godson Naruto where it was all but said that Jiraiya never even <em>met</em> the kid for the first twelve years of his life. A good part of Naruto surviving his childhood was due to Iruka, who somehow managed to be Naruto's actual adoptive parent despite only being about ten years older.
</li><li> While it is a far cry from neglect, Yotsuba Koiwai of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em> spends a lot of time unsupervised, considering that she's only five. Can be justified due to different culture values. Japanese children are allowed to go around unsupervised more commonly, usually when walking to school or taking the subway.
</li><li> Yukino's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HohzukiIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HohzukiIsland">Hohzuki Island</a></em> seemed to ignore her completely as a teenager, and barely acknowledged her walking around naked and declaring she's going to town; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> however, that tiny acknowledgment is enough to show Yukino that her parents do care, and their relationship eventually improves - well, they still talk to each other anyway</span>. Since they're shown in person (and thus not too busy with work) relaxing at home (with coffee, not drugs), it's probable that they're just leaving their daughter alone like they wanted their parents to when they were teens. Yukino's friend has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">the opposite problem</a> and is eventually <em>jailed</em> for being a neglectful mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em>: Haruka's parents are divorced and she lives with her mom, who's like this. She isn't spacy or detatched or self-involved, though, she's just really lazy, especially by stereotypical anime mom standards, and sleeps all the time.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Miharu's Grandmother</strong>: He's injured every time he comes back...At first I was even considering whether I ought to have a talk with the police! Ha ha ha! <br/><strong>Yukimi</strong>: Ha ha ha...

He basically let servants raise Farnese since he was afraid of her erratic behavior as a young girl, which definitely explains a lot. He only seems to care about his children as political pawns. Farnese's mother was absent for most of her childhood, as well.
</li><li> Masaomi Kida's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> apparently take this view and seem entirely unconcerned about their son going out late at night, dropping out of high school (and before that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becoming a gang leader</span>) to the point that his friend Mikado pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on it. Ironically of his three friends Masaomi is the only one whose parents are actually around, as Mikado's parents rent an apartment for him closer to his school and Anri's are dead, but you'd never know it by how he acts.

Peter Parker was a teenager living with his Aunt May, he had super-power, a secret identity, a Spider-Man costume, works in the newspaper taking photos of Spider-Man, stayed out of home at any hour or during any time needed, get back home hurt... and May never suspected anything. Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comic book, where May actually enforced some discipline (up to the point when she knew what was going on and Gwen Stacy, Iceman and the Human Torch moved to live with them; then it became an even greater "Lane house" than the original Spider-Man)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>: Carrie Kelley's parents are so hands-off that they're depicted as having trouble remembering she exists at all when she's not there. (Which is convenient for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>, since it allows him to completely bypass the question of how she's going to explain to them about her new career path.) It may have something to do with the way they're always surrounded by a haze of what is probably not tobacco smoke. There's also a reference to 'needles', suggesting that their presence in this trope may also be down to harder stuff...
</li><li> This is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> amounted to when he took in Roy Harper. While they spent plenty of time fighting bad guys together, out of costume Ollie had barely any presence in Roy's life and was pretty oblivious to what was going on with him, including the crippling sense of abandonment and loneliness building up inside Roy that led to his heroin addiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> Tim Drake was the result of some incredibly hands off parenting by his globe trotting parents. They loved him, and he them, but he often didn't even know what country they were in and his father at least had no idea what his son even liked. This neglect enabled him to wander about Gotham as a kid and figure out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> and Robin's identities, though presumably his parents assumed Tim was safe in one of the many boarding schools they consigned him to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>:
<ul><li> After the death of the Pride, Karolina ended up in a foster home run by stoners.
</li><li> Poor Klara suffered an extreme case of this - her highly-religious parents didn't want a daughter who could command plant life, and thus married her off at age <em>eleven</em> to a god-fearing alcoholic who vowed to bring her under control. Said alcoholic ended up physically and sexually abusing her and sending her off to work in unsafe factories to earn booze money for him.

Early in the store Mob's mother reaches her breaking point when she catches Mob and Ritsu fighting and she vents her frustrations at Mob. Mob then decides to run away from home and live with Reigen, a man that they have only met once before. As of the latest chapter her parents still have no intention of telling their daughter to come back home, or to parent Mob in any way, even after many people on the internet begin to speculate that Reigen's relationship with Mob may be inappropriate.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetMeIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetMeIn">Let Me In</a></em>, Owen's mother is clearly completely detached from his life due her own alcoholism and despondency over her failed marriage. She is completely unaware that Owen is being physically and emotionally tortured by bullies every day at school and is developing psychological quirks at home due to his sheer loneliness. She thinks everything is just fine and dandy with him. Owen's father, meanwhile, hasn't even seen him for an undetermined amount of time and is also oblivious to his plight. It's an ironic point that Abby, a vampire, shows more genuine concern for Owen's well-being than either of his parents. It makes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Owen's decision to leave with Abby at the end of the film completely understandable</span>.

<ul><li> Her burning desire to <em>not</em> be this sort of parent has led to a daughter who resents her and another who is unresponsive and turned inside herself (especially after her sister's death.) Joy, for her part, doesn't seem to understand why her daughters don't see that she's so much of a better parent than their grandmother that the only logical response is enduring praise and unending gratefulness.
</li><li> For example, when Reggie starts wearing all black and hanging around with "witches" her age who want to cast spells and summon the dead, Joy is glad that Reggie is coming out of her shell and making new friends. She even bakes cookies for their little coven. Reggie is mortified.

So when Abby and Larry decide to get married, she is really into it, but when her dad basically backs out to "play the field", Dharma has a meltdown confessing her fear. By episodes end they do get married, but Larry has an (if I really want to, I can still play the field) clause thrown in... even though only Abby will put up with him by this point.
</li><li> In another episode, Dharma finds out that her parents are planning to have another baby, and she begins to wax nostalgic about her own childhood, and such beloved toys as "shoeboat". Then she finds out they plan to raise baby more conventionally than they did Dharma, and she suddenly realizes how many of her beloved memories were probably motivated just as much by the benefit of not having to spend any money on her as they were her parents' "let the butterfly go free" parenting strategy (shoeboat, as the name might suggest, is in fact an ordinary shoe which Dharma was encouraged to think of as a boat at bathtime). Eventually her parents manage to convince her they really did, and still do, love her, just like they're going to love this new child.

His parents divorced when he was 9, and his mother was a famous, erotic novelist who was always on tour, and his dad ran off to Vegas to be a drag queen. The few mentions of his childhood involve houseboys and boarding school. As an adult, his Mom is more likely to talk about him in TV interviews than to call.

The much more controlling Michael tries to get Lindsay to pay more attention, but she maintains that he's stifling his son (she may have a point) and refuses to get involved unless forced to.

Later in the episode, Cam gets his hand stuck in a garbage disposal while Lily runs around the kitchen flipping switches at random, prompting Claire to smugly taunt him about his parenting style.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin">Doc Martin</a></em> featured a young family moving in next to Louisa. When their son broke a plate and Louisa got cross, the father chastised <em>her</em> for making it a "child-centric moment." Later the boy is found to be keying the local cars, but they still won't punish him, saying that he "should be free to set his own boundaries." The boy later contracts tuberculosis from letting a stray cat share his bed, for which Martin rightly calls the whole family out for their stupidity.

The justification is given quite early on: He was a control freak with Ash's mother, which led her to abandon them both when Ash was three, and doesn't want the same thing to happen again. He does lay the law down a few times, one example being when Ash got drunk and even told off a rather vicious associate of the brothers when it seemed he could be dangerous to the teens.

<ul><li> In the memoir <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGlassCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGlassCastle">The Glass Castle</a></em>, Jeannette, Brian, Lori, and Maureen have parents like this. Ditzy, artistic, neglectful to the point of borderline abuse, and so on. An interesting case, since this is implied to have a somewhat beneficial effect in the long run. The kids are incredibly self sufficient, helping each other survive their childhood, supporting themselves financially, and fleeing one by one to make a life for themselves in New York.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherTitus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherTitus">Christopher Titus</a> described running into this style in "Neverlution", during a trip to the DMV where he saw a little boy who was an absolute terror (screaming, yelling, temper tantrums, etc.). When the child threatened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">leave the building</a> his father did nothing more than calmly ask how they could "transform this situation". Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">Titus' own upbringing</a>, this was utterly bizarre, as well as largely ineffectual as the boy <em>kept</em> throwing his tantrum. Of course, once Titus raised <em>his</em> voice to the kid (and implying that his parents were there <em>because</em> of the kid, which worked in shutting him up), the father turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a>.
</li><li> Too many species to list have the parenting strategy of "Have a bunch of kids, then leave them alone as soon as they're born and let evolution work". If they come out of eggs, they don't even have to wait until birth to abandon them.
</li><li> Sadly, quite common amongst parents who feel that their own parents were too strict with them as a kid and thus will stand around whilst their children cause havoc in stores. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Kids who don't learn to respect authority or that actions have consequences very commonly get in trouble with the law when they get older</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaDidntRaiseNoCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaDidntRaiseNoCriminal">with the parents often utterly surprised</a>.
</li><li> Among European royalty and nobility this happened relatively often, in no small part because of resentful mothers (and occasionally fathers) who felt that they fulfilled their entire obligation to their arranged marriages by having an heir - and maybe a spare. Of course it helps that they had governors and nannies to hand the kids off to. However, the stereotype that aristocrats in the pre-modern era always delegated their children's upbringing isn't true and there were exceptions even in the heyday of monarchy and aristocracy, like the monarchs Charles I, George III, and Victoria of England, King Henri IV of France (who so harshly disciplined his son, the future Louis XIII, that even his seventeenth century contemporaries who didn't disapprove of corporal punishment to say the least noted it), and Marie Antoinette. But there are notable examples as well, like Henry VIII, who had little to do with the upbringing of even his much desired male heir; Marguerite Louise d'Orleans, who after giving her much hated husband, Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany, three children returned to France and barely communicated with any of them even when they grew into adulthood; and Marie Eléonore de Maillé de Carman, mother of the notorious Marquis de Sade.
<ul><li> In Henry VIII's case it wasn't so much hands off as remote control. Henry didn't spend much time with his children but he was a micro-manager of their household regulations, especially those of Prince Edward.
