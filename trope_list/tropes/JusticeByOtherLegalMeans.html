</div></div><p>Sometimes the detectives/prosecutors have found out who the true culprit is, but there is simply not enough evidence to arrest/convict the perp.
</p><p>However, sometimes the heroes demonstrate there are other ways to make the guilty pay that do not involve going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">outside the law</a> themselves.

</p><ul><li> <strong>Justice by Insurance:</strong> In this case, the criminal has gotten a big payout from the insurance company related to the crime he actually caused. In this conclusion, while the justice system's hands are tied, the evidence presented is enough for the insurance company to take back their money saying that it was obviously claimed under criminal circumstances. Of course, the criminal could be stupid enough to sue, but that means his crime could be fully revealed and he is really sunk.
</li><li> <strong>Justice by Lawsuit:</strong> The prosecutor was not able to convict the criminal, but the evidence amassed could be given to the victim and/or his family as good enough grounds to sue the criminal for everything they have in civil court.
</li><li> <strong>Justice by Diplomatic Intervention:</strong> The criminal could skip the country or claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a> by his own nation, unaware that their government wants to haul him into their own courts and all they have to do is use the other country's court records to nail him to the wall. Alternately, his country's government might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">decide to revoke his diplomatic immunity</a> or extradite him back to the protagonists' own country to be tried anyway.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Justice for Another Crime:</strong> The criminal can't be indicted for one crime, but he or she can get nailed for another. Tax Evasion instead of murder, for example. This one is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. May also be the discovery they had committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">Felony Murder</a>. If the convicted crime in question is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">disproportionately minor</a>, it may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JaywalkingWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JaywalkingWillRuinYourLife">Jaywalking Will Ruin Your Life</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot">Minor Crime Reveals Major Plot</a>. This is also why most court cases have a litany of charges, so that the jury can deliberate over all of them at once rather than having a Not Guilty verdict for the most serious offense and have Jeopardy become attached. Alternately, the criminal has committed crimes in multiple jurisdictions, and is caught in one of them. A criminal might be convicted and jailed for armed robbery in one jurisdiction without the authorities realizing they've unwittingly caught the serial killer who's been terrorizing another jurisdiction.

However, common law permits cases where multiple jurisdictions have sovereignty, for example a case that could be tried in the courts of multiple states or provinces, or a state court and a national court, to be retried in other jurisdictions if the suspect is acquitted on the first attempt. (Some countries also permit retrial if new evidence is found, but strictly speaking that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NotAnExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NotAnExample">Not an Example</a>.)
</li></ul><p>Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">Framing the Guilty Party</a>, where the suspect's guilt cannot be sufficiently proven and so the cops plant evidence to get a conviction, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteExecution">Vigilante Execution</a>, where a vigilante kills the suspect after he walks.

<ul><li> In a filler episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Gohan successfully rescues a baby dinosaur from an evil circus owner who had abducted and was abusing it. As he flies away, the circus owner points out that he knows where the dinosaur's nest is: there's nothing stopping him from going back and stealing the dino again. The police further admit that capturing a baby animal for use in the circus is entirely legal...<em>but</em> the circus owner had, during the fight, taken a police officer's gun in an attempt to shoot the dino's angry parents. And taking an officer's handgun is a criminal offense.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShamansTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShamansTears">Shaman's Tears</a></em>, Joshua Brand is unable to arrest the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> for various crimes because the victims (genetically engineered lifeforms) are not technically human. So he instead arrests him for violating the Endangered Species Act after he realizes one of the genetically engineered constructs was created using the DNA of a black-footed ferret.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">600th issue</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>, the Bar with No Name is shut down not for harboring criminals (which it does, but they all have already fled by the time the cops arrived), but for not having a liquor license.
</li><li> Happened a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the end of <em>The Pit</em>, Dredd has no evidence to convict Fonzo Bongo on being the head of his sector's branch of the Frendz crime syndicate. What Dredd does have, thanks to an observant rookie, is several hundred unpaid parking tickets in Bongo's name, earning him a sentence of twenty five years.
</li><li> In an old Daily Star newspaper strip, Dredd can't prove a crime boss sent a bomb to kill him, but he can get the guy for illegal parking. Since Dredd has no intention of towing the offending car, it will still be illegally parked when the boss gets out (after thirty days) and so the boss will essentially serve a life sentence for parking rather than attempted Judge killing. Once he hears this the crook promptly confesses on the grounds that if he were going away anyway he isn't doing life for parking offenses.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final issue of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/COPSAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/COPSAnimatedSeries">C.O.P.S.</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">Comic-Book Adaptation</a>, the team went after Big Boss for an unpaid parking ticket, knowing that his gang would try to stop themand racking up tons of charges they could pin on the previously untouchable Big Boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LowLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LowLife">Low-Life</a></em>, Nixon can't prove that Tyrone Appleby of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatCamp">Lo-Cal</a> is guilty of brainwashing and murdering rich fatties to take all their money. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">She collars him for soliciting a prostitute</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet">herself</a>) instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em>, a confrontation with the Crimson Avenger reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wildcat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wildcat">Wildcat</a> framed a man for killing his fiancé, but reveals that he only did that because he couldn't prove that the man had killed his brother, sister-in-law and nephew after his brother killed the man's fiancé, although Wildcat insists that he just ensured the man's arrest and it was up to the courts if he were executed.
</li><li> Mr. Mastermind makes his debut in the comic book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DynomuttDogWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DynomuttDogWonder">Dynomutt, Dog Wonder</a></em> by holding the city hostage over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">the $ 1.47 fine he had to pay for a 49-day overdue library book</a>. When Blue Falcon and Dynomutt find his hideout, he blows it up so there won't be any proof to get him arrested for the crime. Unfortunately, for him, he's 49 <em>years</em> overdue with another library book and ends up being arrested for it. He's so ego driven he considers it worse than being arrested for the main crime.

<ul><li> Common in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse">CSI Verse</a>.
<ul><li> In one case, someone was cleared of murder during a burglary but discovered to be guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">Felony Murder</a>.
</li><li> In another case, the perp initially got away with murder by framing his victim for the sexual assault of his 12-year-old daughter. When new evidence proved that the killer was in fact the abuser, he was arrested for the new crime, one which guarantees an automatic life sentence without parole.
</li><li> In yet another episode, the team can't get enough evidence to press charges against a guy who murdered his wife before the episode is over. However, they assure him it's only the beginning of their investigation. In the meantime, the evidence acquired thus far is enough for the wife's insurance company to want their $750k back and to start repossessing the guy's stuff, starting with his brand new Ferrari.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> has Horatio unable to arrest a murderer because he has diplomatic immunity. However, one of the victims was a Canadian citizen, and Canada does not recognize the guy's diplomatic status. When the guy's yacht ends up in international waters, Horatio alerts the authorities.
</li><li> Another <em>CSI: Miami</em> episode has Horatio figure out that the deaths of two people were caused by toxic genetically modified lettuce but cannot press charges against the company or its smug CEO. However, all the evidence he gathered will make for a massive lawsuit by the victims' families.
</li><li> In one of the few original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> episodes not involving murder, an exhibit of valuable Japanese historical items is robbed, with the perps making off with several items and millions of dollars in cash from the vault. The team finds out that all the items were fake. The perps, including the supposed owner of the items, a wealthy Japanese businessman, turn out to be employees of the guy hosting the exhibit (the pretender was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAsianCultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAsianCultures">Chinese</a>). Grissom confronts him with the evidence, but the guy points out that there's not enough to press charges. Grissom agrees but says he will send the evidence to the guy's insurance company to expose his scam.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> episode, "Pot of Gold," when the main perp (who hired a man to kill a pair of journalists and an informant to cover up a gold counterfeiting scheme) denies having any connection to the murders, Mac (who has no solid evidence linking him to the killer) calls in a Treasury Agent who informs said perp of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">laundry list</a> of charges against him because of the aforementioned counterfeiting, for which they have <em>a lot</em> of physical evidence, including <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualWeapon">one of the fake bars being the murder weapon</a>. Mac and Stella walk away grinning as the agent goes on.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also a fairly common tactic on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, as is threatening suspects' friends and acquaintances with accessory charges to get them to testify — or to get the criminal to confess.
<ul><li> For example, an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> has a man get off for manslaughter and drug running after a witness changes his statement. After the trial, Steel has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> and asks his boss to "pull a Capone" on him and get him for tax evasion (which they do).
</li><li> In a classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> episode, the show's resident expert psychologist, Dr. Olivet, accuses a gynecologist of raping her, but the court is forced to withdraw the charges when the defense attorney claims that Dr. Olivet has visited the OB-GYN when one of her patients claimed he had raped her, and therefore claims entrapment. ADA Stone then publicly announces that the city of New York would attempt to prosecute the OB-GYN again. When the doctor gloats that they can't touch him for Olivet's rape, Stone reveals that after his public announcement, some fifty-plus former patients stepped forward with rape charges of their own. As Stone then says when discussing a reduced sentence, Stone answers, "In a perfect world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedDeathThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedDeathThreat">I would leave you in a room with your former patients for an hour</a>. I'll settle for you spending the rest of your life in jail." The same happens with the UK version of the episode, "Alesha".
</li><li> An episode in the Ben Stone era features an African clan leader, whose drug-trafficking resulted in a few deaths and was thus charged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">Felony Murder</a>, fleeing to his home country in the middle of his trial, with the cooperation of his country's embassy. When confronted, the ambassador points out that the clan leader has been arrested in his native country, and the New York DA's office has done his country a great favor by bringing forward all that evidence, which could not be gathered in his native land due to his political power, but now that they have absolute proof of his guilt, and they can charge him with drug trafficking, which, unlike New York's Felony Murder law, allows for the death penalty.
</li><li> Jack McCoy is an expert at coming up with creative "legal theories" usually involving a defendant's actions being legally reinterpreted to make them guilty of a legal statute that wasn't obvious before or coming up with a new theory of the defendant's motive to sidestep some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">evidentiary hurdle</a> that enabled him to present an open-and-shut case (or threaten to present it in order to force a plea). The most common example was a "Depraved Indifference" murder, where Jack only had to prove the defendant acted recklessly or neglected a legal burden to act in a given situation, even if they were not provably guilty of the actual murder.
</li><li> There's also a few episodes where McCoy doesn't have enough admissible evidence to convict the accused of what actually happened, so he instead re-presents the evidence based on a version of events that he suspects or even <em>knows</em> is false, but still holds together from a legal standpoint. People would occasionally try to call him out on this, accusing him of essentially lying in court by making bogus claims, but he'd always insist he was only presenting the jury a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">"theory" which they were free to either agree with or reject</a> and that there was no reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">legal loopholes</a> shouldn't work <em>both</em> ways.
<ul><li> One example: A woman hires a hitman to murder her wastrel husband who is driving her broke, then murders the hitman when he tries to blackmail her. The evidence showing she hired him in the first place is ruled inadmissible, so McCoy instead argues that the hitman was hired by someone else, and his murder was the result of the dead man's grief-stricken wife taking revenge on him. Even though it's the exact <em>opposite</em> of what happened, there's enough admissible evidence that he gets his conviction.
</li><li> A pregnant woman and her boyfriend deliberately stage an assault on her that causes a miscarriage so they can file a wrongful death suit. When their plan is uncovered, the DA brings murder charges, only for the boyfriend to smugly tell them the unborn fetus was too young to count as a "person" under the law, and therefore they can't be convicted. Stone instead argues that he believes they didn't know that particular technicality at the time of the crime and only found it out later when constructing their defense, thus they acted with the prerequisite intent that legally satisfies <em>attempted</em> murder. Despite the fact the boyfriend had some legal training and probably was telling the <em>truth</em> the Jury buys the prosecution's theory out of sheer indignation at them and they're convicted.
</li><li> Another involves a pair of conspirators who shot a man just for the thrill. Their defense tactic is to have both of them point fingers at the other, only one person actually shot the victim (only one bullet was fired) and the evidence proving conspiracy was thrown out. The jury can't convict them both, and since they're unsure who did it, they would likely acquit both. However, McCoy tricks one of the lawyers into getting the trials severed. The result, both defendants will now face separate trials for the <em>same</em> crime, where attempting to blame their co-conspirator is a defense the jury can choose to believe or not. And given the heinousness of the crime, they probably won't. We don't see it play out though, one of the defendants confesses out of guilt before his case can go to the jury, and his testimony hangs his partner. D.A. Schiff even remarks on how McCoy got the justice system to legally accept a physical impossibility (both men fired the same bullet from the same gun).
</li><li> Another good example is when the police are in pursuit of a pair of thugs who killed an off-duty cop and kidnapped a limo driver. They catch one of the pair, but with no idea if the limo driver is dead or alive McCoy is forced to give him a very advantageous plea deal (including any "related crimes") in exchange for the whereabouts of the driver. Of course, the driver was already dead and the police later find the guy's partner also dead. McCoy can't get out of the deal, so he charges the living perp with murdering his partner on the slippery theory that the partner's murder was not established as a "related crime" when the defendant took the original plea bargain. This leads to the quote at the top of the page, the plea means the original perp essentially walks for killing a cop, but ends up drawing a lengthy prison sentence anyway, for killing his accomplice.
</li><li> One from a different vector comes about when an OJ Simpson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>, who had gotten off on the murder of his wife due to a bribed juror, is eventually nailed for the murder of the publisher of a book about the previous trial. McCoy was eventually able to get evidence that the defendant had lied about previous evidence, but also that he admitted killing his wife. The jury convicted him of the current murder, but looking at the jury kind of implied this trope for the previous case.
</li><li> Yet another case involves two women, Adele and Belinda, who had arranged to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangersOnATrainPlotMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangersOnATrainPlotMurder">kill each other's husbands</a>. Belinda is wealthy and able to buy a top-dollar defense, so she's acquitted of killing Adele's husband while Adele, who can't afford the same quality of representation, is convicted of killing Belinda's. McCoy realizes that, given the disparate outcomes, Adele would be willing to testify against Belinda, especially if she got a deal on sentencing, but he can't re-try Belinda for murdering Adele's husband because that would be double jeopardy. So instead he has Belinda charged with murder for hire in the death of her <em>own</em> husband, on the premise that Belinda murdering Adele's husband in return constituted a payment for purposes of the law. When a judge agrees, Belinda realizes there's no getting around this one and accepts a deal herself.

</div><ul><li> Inverted in another episode. A case is in jeopardy after a rape victim dies of a staph infection, so Cabot adds on some additional charges that allow her to present more evidence. The defendant is acquitted of the additional charges, but the evidence that was introduced based on those charges allows him to be convicted of the original charge of rape.
</li><li> Yet another SVU case involves a man who runs an organization that encourages adults to have sex with children. They catch him, but they can only link him to one victim, and since he didn't personally abuse the boy, his actions only carry a ten-year sentence, so Alex also has him charged him with possession of child pornography, and manages to get consecutive two-year sentences for each of the 1500 images on his computer.

The killer, confident he's beyond the reach of American law enforcement, tearfully confesses that he did it by accident, at which point, Brenda reveals that the murdered girl <em>hadn't</em> been born in the U.S., as her mother had claimed.

The Mexican cops lay hands on him, and Brenda is noticeably disturbed right afterwards, breaking out the booze she bought to bribe the Federales if needed; you <em>don't</em> want to be a white prettyboy in a Mexican prison. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tv.com/the-closer/good-housekeeping/episode/410670/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap">More detail here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

US Attorney Caroline Julian calls them near the end of the episode to tell them to arrest the man. She has handed the evidence to the DC DA, who is going to prosecute him for fraud. As Caroline notes, "Murder isn't the only crime. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">It just seems like it</a> around you two."

An ambassador's son is smuggling drugs in diplomatic bags — specially marked and exempt from searches as part of diplomatic immunity. The cops convince a citizen known for clumsy driving to make a fender-bender on the kid's car, so the contents of the bags in the trunk can be examined. For <em>damage</em>. The traffic cops are admirable: fast, polite and by-the-book. The commissioner is overseeing them personally. While <em>reading from said book</em>. And it's all in the guise of preventing a diplomatic incident. The son has diplomatic immunity (and so can't be charged) because he is still a college student, so the Metro PD have to make their case to the Dean and get him expelled before successfully charging him.

<ul><li> "Mr. Monk and the Wrong Man": an ex-con named Max Barton has been exonerated from a conviction for a particularly gruesome double murder, and Monk tries to help him rebuild his life. When the original witness to the crime chides him harshly for helping the very person she insists was the man she saw leaving the crime scene after she heard screaming, Monk suddenly realizes a detail about the crime scene that means Barton <em>was</em> guilty of the original murders all along, but due to double jeopardy, he can't be retried for them. However, Monk finds that they still can rearrest Barton for killing his partner from the original crime out of fear the guy would talk.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk Takes the Stand": a sculptor named Evan Gildea is suspected of murdering his wife Nancy and making it look like a break-in. However, when the trial comes up, Gildea's lawyer, the Saul Goodman-esque Harrison Powell, gets the case against his client thrown out by discrediting Monk and Captain Stottlemeyer despite all the evidence suggesting Gildea is guilty. However, Randy then approaches Monk asking him to help exonerate Rudy Smith, a friend of his from a police outreach program who has been accused of robbing an auto parts store and killing a clerk in the process (Rudy has confessed to robbing the clerk and taking her necklace and money from the cashier). In examining the scene, Monk notices evidence that exonerates Rudy of murder, and then he finds a discarded taillight bulb in the bushes next to the store, meaning that while they are unable to put Evan Gildea away for murdering his wife, they can put him away for killing the store clerk.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13daz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13daz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13daz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Monk had noticed when Gildea was driving away from the courthouse after his acquittal, his left taillight looked like it had recently been replaced.

He does prove, however, that she committed a second murder to cover up the first, and that's good enough for him. Thus, the title of the episode; as he puts it, "A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush."
</li><li> In another episode, the killer is a foreign diplomat, so even if Columbo proves he is the killer, he can't be prosecuted. In the embassy, Columbo manages to get him to confess to the crime — and be overheard by his boss, the leader of his country. Knowing the difference between the legal systems in his country and the US, the killer immediately waives his diplomatic immunity.

As a result, the perpetrator walked free. Despite Erin's best efforts, she cannot find any evidence to bring the rapist to trial as the evidence from the original crime has been tainted. She is, however, able to find evidence to arrest the dean for deliberately ignoring evidence in a cover-up attempt.

The state prosecutor throws the case in exchange for the kidnapper telling him where the victim is so she can be rescued, but then hands the material off to the local <em>federal</em> prosecutor for retrial, since the use of the national park means the perp also broke federal kidnapping statutes.
</li><li> An antagonistic example in another episode had a federal prosecutor trying a man from a mafia family for mail fraud (an insurance claim against a fire that is believed to be arson and killed a janitor) uses multiple attempts at a federal grand jury to get an indictment. Under the law, this does not count as double jeopardy, so Quincy has to prove forensically that the fire was accidental (the janitor's cleaning chemicals leaked onto a space heater). (The supposed mafia man, by the way, is entirely innocent and actively rebuffed attempts by his family to use his business for money-laundering.)

<ul><li> Matt first attempts to get testimony from Detective Blake, a corrupt cop on Fisk's payroll who got shot for being disloyal, but Fisk blackmails Blake's partner Hoffman into poisoning him in the hospital, so instead Matt ends up having Hoffman (who only did it because Fisk and Wesley threatened to have him killed otherwise) snitch on Fisk.
</li><li> In between Detective Blake's death and trying to use Hoffman, they try to take down Fisk using their tenancy dispute between Elena Cardenas and her landlord Armund Tully, a notorious slumlord who is being paid by Fisk. This fails when Fisk has Elena killed as part of a trap to lure Matt into a fight with Nobu.
</li><li> After this, Karen finds out that Fisk is hiding his mother in an upstate nursing home. When she and Ben go there, they get Marlene to reveal that Fisk killed his father with a hammer when he was just 12 years old. Unfortunately, Marlene's word is not considered reliable enough to implicate Fisk due to her age and senility (she'll die offscreen between now and the events of season 3), and Fisk kills Ben before he can get some corroborating information from an old mafia contact of his, plus moves his mother to Italy, rendering this angle dead in the water.
</li><li> Season 3 ends up repeating this, after Fisk manages to beat his charges and gets out of prison. Karen tries to connect Fisk to the hotel he's under house arrest in. Matt first tries to expose Fisk by bringing in an inmate Fisk hired to shank himself as part of his gambit to get out of prison, but Fisk hires Dex to kill said witness. Ultimately, what takes Fisk down this time is a two step process: first, Karen provokes Fisk into sending Dex after her to avenge James Wesley, causing Dex to go after her at Matt's church, during which Father Lantom gets killed. Subsequently, Ray Nadeem (the agent who sprung Fisk) grows a conscience and decides to testify before a grand jury, with Matt and Foggy negotiating a deal for him with Blake Tower. Fisk thwarts their attempt to use the grand jury by intimidating the jurors, so Nadeem goes home and records a confession video before Dex is sent to his house by Vanessa to kill him. The video ends up being what brings down Fisk, while Matt brings down Dex by using Fisk's murder of a woman close to him to get Dex to turn against Fisk.

In <em>Gunsmoke's</em> case, Marshall Dillon will do some vast detective work to right the wrong or clear the presumed guilty party. However in season 10's "Old Man," an unidentified old man is framed for stabbing another man and is hanged for the crime, even after Dillon vouches for his innocence in court since there was no evidence to the contrary. It's when the actual murderer starts talking too much in the saloon that Dillon is tipped off.

Alba confesses to a murder of a man that infiltrated his embassy, but this means Alba will be tried in the courts of his home country. This forces to Edgeworth quickly investigate the possibility that another murder happened on local soil, and if Alba killed the other victim, Alba can be tried locally. Of course, Alba still needs his diplomatic immunity revoked first.

</li><li> Phoenix and Edgeworth work together to pull this off in the last trial of <em>Justice For All</em>. The defendant is guilty of hiring someone to kill a rival, but they have only circumstantial evidence on him, and he could walk (not to mention that the assassin had kidnapped Phoenix's assistant and was threatening to kill her if his client wasn't acquitted). So Phoenix mentions to the hired assassin (who's communicating via radio) that his client had kept blackmail material on him for insurance (proof of which was obtained by Franziska in an unexpected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment).

His days as a Chicago crime boss ended with an 11-year prison sentence for tax evasion, the longest sentence ever given for the crime. Somewhat hilariously, the government couldn't make the case that Capone was a crime kingpin, but they <em>could</em> point to his lifestyle and spending habits and say he was earning money he hadn't paid taxes on. It was pointed out at the time that the government was consciously ignoring <em>how</em> Capone had earned the money (which they couldn't prove) and instead focusing on the fact that he <em>had</em> the money and owed taxes on it. It's also necessary to consider that when charged with other sorts of crimes, Capone usually got a "not guilty" verdict from the jury <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering">by having his men bribe or intimidate them</a>.

</li><li> Since then, tax forms have contained instructions that people must list any proceeds gained from criminal activity that year. Not doing so opens them up to later charges of tax evasion, and it avoids a conflict with the right against self-incrimination by not asking that they specify <em>what</em> crime they committed, just the proceeds generated from it.
</li><li> Due to the notorious difficulty in prosecuting police officers for murdering people of color, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53508640">the same thing may happen to Derek Chauvin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Similarly, there are stories of gangsters who, after managing to finagle out of a trial for murder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">were brought up on littering charges</a> after it was later proved they had disposed of bodies in the river.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OJSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OJSimpson">OJ Simpson</a>:
<ul><li> After being declared not guilty for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in 1995 through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">a combination of incompetence on the part of the authorities</a> and his lawyers making the very public argument he was the victim of racism, O. J. was later sued by the Goldman family in a civil wrongful death lawsuit, who were awarded damages in excess of $30 million. However, he's paid only a tiny fraction of this. The rights to a failed book deal concerning <em>If I Did It</em> passed to the Goldman family. It was a book in which Simpson presents the scenario of how the murders would have taken place if he had committed the crimes and public outcry ensured it never got publication. In 2007, the Goldman family republished the book with the new name <em><span class="font-xs">If</span> I Did It: Confessions of the Killer</em> with the "if" so small as to be unnoticeable.
</li><li> In 2007, Simpson argued that his current conviction and sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping is this for his acquittal for murder. Granted, the possibility was pointed out by the judge, who warned the jury that they could get removed from the bench if they used the murder trial as a prior prejudice. Though the general public thought he was all but convicted the moment he was arrested, it is also unlikely that many have sympathy for him about this. In an interesting contrast to his last trial, many believed that he was poorly defended, and also that the authorities actually did have an agenda this time around.
</li></ul></li><li> Jack McCall was found not guilty of murdering Wild Bill Hickock, despite doing it in front of several witnesses. However, the court his trial took place in was set up by a town illegally settled on Indian territory, so it had no authority. This allowed him to be tried again in the Indian territory court, without violation of double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. He was convicted by the jury and sentenced to death. His last words before hanging were in response to a question why he shot Hickock, a famous gunfighter who had out-drawn everyone who ever faced him, in the back: "I wasn't looking to commit suicide."
</li><li> Most serial killers are not convicted of all crimes they are believed to have committed, or even of all the crimes they claim to have done. For example, it's believed that Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer, among others, may have killed more people than just the ones they were convicted of. Possibly the most extreme example is the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Shipman">Dr Harold Shipman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was eventually convicted of fifteen counts of murder by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrFeelgood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrFeelgood">over-prescribing painkillers</a> but whose total body-count is estimated to be over <em>two hundred</em>.
<ul><li> Similarly, serial killers, rapists and other criminals who commit particularly heinous crimes that make the news have been known to end up being jailed for other offenses without the authorities realizing that they've caught the person who's wanted for the more infamous crimes.
</li><li> This is often done <em>intentionally</em>; the idea being to charge only the crimes with which they have the best evidence. It has also been known for the government to only charge the number of crimes they need to ensure a life sentence; this way if those sentences are somehow invalidated or the criminal somehow paroled, they can immediately arrest and charge the criminal with the other crimes they weren't accused of the first time, ensuring that they're kept off the street.
</li></ul></li><li> A problem in the Southern US during the heyday of the Ku Klux Klan was that oftentimes a KKK member would be arrested for assaulting or murdering a black man, but would be acquitted despite overwhelming evidence, because the juries in the states where the KKK was most active usually contained KKK sympathizers at the very least, and potentially, actual Klan members. So the FBI then began arresting the KKK members for conspiring to violate civil rights, which is a <em>federal</em> crime, and the perpetrator would therefore be tried in a federal court, whose jurors were not nearly so sympathetic.
</li><li> British artist and fraudster Thomas Griffiths Wainewright fled arrest for the poisoning of his sister-in-law (he was also suspected of poisoning his uncle, mother-in-law, and his friend, in order to cash in on their life insurances) and took refuge in France. Since this was the 1830s, there was no surviving evidence to convict him of murder when he voluntarily returned to Britain seven years later. There was, however, enough to convict him of a forgery case that had taken place in 1824, and he was deported to a harsh penal colony in Tasmania where he died before a decade passed.
</li><li> Another 19th-century criminal, Edward Rulloff, could not be prosecuted for the murders of his wife and daughter according to the laws of the time because their bodies were never found. But he could be tried, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the <em>kidnapping</em> of his wife, because it was considered that she would never leave the family home of her own free will without taking a single one of her items with her.
</li><li> Former US Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) was sent to prison this way. He was accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">sex offenses with young men</a> during his time as a wrestling coach, before going into politics, but the alleged offenses occurred so long ago that the Statute of Limitations had expired. However, he was convicted of a financial offense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">(under the PATRIOT Act that he helped pass into law)</a> related to his attempts to bribe one of the victims into keeping silent.
</li><li> Following the acquittal of the police officers involved in the Rodney King beating by an all-white jury, the presiding judge doxxed every last juror. This was significant because normally, the names of the jurors in a trial are not released for a specified period of time. This was recounted in one interview featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwilightLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwilightLosAngeles">Twilight: Los Angeles</a></em>. All the officers involved were later charged with and convicted of federal civil rights violations as well.
</li><li> Former Chicago Police Department detective and commander Jon Burge was notorious for torturing more than 200 criminal suspects (mostly minorities) between 1972 and 1991 in order to force confessions. Burge was acquitted of police brutality charges in 1989 after his trial resulted in a hung jury and a lot of additional evidence that was stacked against him couldn't be used because of the statute of limitations. Nonetheless, Burge was arrested on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury in relation to a civil suit regarding the torture allegations against him as perjury has no such statute of limitations.
</li><li> "Pharma Bro" Martin Shkreli became the most hated CEO in America after he raised the price of a AIDS-related drug by over 5,000%. However, raising a price of a drug he owns is legal, so nothing could be done about that. Then it was discovered that he was involved in a Ponzi-like scheme, which is a federal crime. <a class="urllink" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/public-enemy/">Also, it turns out that making yourself the most hated CEO in America is not conducive to getting an unbiased jury.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Shkreli was ultimately sentenced to 7 years in prison, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">crying in court while his verdict was read.</a>
<div class="indent"> <strong>The Court:</strong> The question is, have you heard anything that would affect your ability to decide this case with an open mind. Can you do that?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Juror no. 144:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">I dont think I can because he kind of looks like a dick.</a>
</div></li><li> The State of Michigan was so horrified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHoneymoonKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHoneymoonKillers">Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck</a>'s murder of young widow Delphine Downing and her two-year-old daughter, Rainelle, that they declined to pursue any charges against them. Instead, they were extradited to New York, where they were wanted for another murder, because New York had the death penalty, while it had been abolished for over a century in Michigan. They were found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death in the electric chair even though it was arguably an impulsive action by Beck alone, unlike the murder of the Downings, which was complex and premeditated. Had Fernandez not pleaded guilty and somehow beaten the charge by blaming Beck, as his defense wanted, the State of New York was ready to extradite him to <em>Spain</em>, where his first murder took place and he could be sentenced to death by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrote">garrote.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Melvin Ignatow of Louisville, Kentucky murdered his girlfriend, Brenda Sue Schaefer. He beat the charge and was acquitted, having sold his house to pay for the defense. Apparently, he forgotten he'd hidden incriminating photos under the carpet. The new homeowners ripped up the carpet and found solid proof that he did, in fact, commit the crime. Because of double jeopardy, he couldn't be charged with the murder again, but he had lied under oath when he testified that he didn't do it. He went to prison for perjury.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Gilbert_Graham">Jack Gilbert Graham<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the first American ever arrested for blowing up a commercial airliner when he was accused of blowing up United Airlines Flight 629 in 1955. However, when prosecutors looked in the federal statutes, they discovered that no one had actually bothered to make it a crime to blow up an airplane. So they turned the case over to state prosecutors, who indicted, tried and convicted him on a single charge of first-degree murder (for his mother, who was one of the passengers and unwittingly carried the bomb aboard).
</li><li> The rare "perjury trap" usually involves a form of this, and works like this: A person committed a crime that is now outside the statute of limitations. A prosecutor calls them to the stand in some trial related to the crime. The prosecutor then specifically asks the person about the previous crime, and the person, who doesn't want to reveal their involvement, lies about it. Now the prosecutor brings a perjury charge as they can prove the person lied on the stand.
</li><li> One notable exception to the "no double jeopardy" rule in the United States is the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A military service member who is subject to it and commits a crime "out in town" (not on military property) that is an offense in both the local and military legal systems can be tried in both, so it is possible for someone to be acquitted by a civilian court but convicted by a court martial for the same offense, or vice versa.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom">United Kingdom</a> with the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treachery_Act_1940">Treachery Act 1940.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> As the then-existing crime of treason had special rules that made it difficult to prove and prosecute, and because treason law was believed not to apply to saboteurs, Parliament created the new crime of treachery, very similar to treason but without the special rules and definitely applicable to saboteurs. After WWII, the special rules for treason were abolished and the Treachery Act was repealed.
