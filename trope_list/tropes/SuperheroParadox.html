<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Until Goku's adventures began, there weren't that many villains causing trouble on Earth, at least not on a planetary scale. In fact, from the switch to "Z" onward, many of the villains that target Earth do so because of or in connection to Goku: the Saiyans show up to check on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a>, Frieza wants revenge for his defeat on Namek, and Cell and the rest of the androids are created by Dr. Gero to avenge the Red Ribbon Army. This trope is one of Goku's reasons for refusing to be resurrected after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in the Cell Games.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> with Pilaf. Goku has thwarted his plans to conquer the world time and again. However, Pilaf's final plan ends up freeing King Piccolo, who proves to be a worse threat than all of Goku's previous villains put together.
</li><li> And speaking of Kami - a great portion of villains in Dragon Ball (as well as Vegeta and Nappa in DBZ) engage in schemes to obtain the magical wish-granting balls that he created. If there were no balls, Pilaf's, for example, ambitions to conquer the world would be just regular squabbles of mortal kingdoms.
</li><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> with Babidi, Dabura, and Buu who have no connections at all with the heroes and the heroes would have been <em>extremely</em> unprepared if the other threats to Earth didn't happen. Although, one of the supposed heroes did make the situation worse.
</li><li> It is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> on an universal scale. Although the Earth itself may have been better off without Goku or the Nameless Namek, if they weren't around, Frieza would still be alive terrorizing the universe along with the remaining Saiyans. And Buu would still exist, waiting to be awakened one day and destroy the universe. Also, who's to say that neither Frieza or the Saiyans wouldn't one day go to Namek and use their Dragon Balls or go to Earth to sell it?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> It is often the Senshi themselves whose energy is needed by villains to fulfill their plans. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">original anime</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Galaxia comes to Earth exclusively to harvest the Senshi's Star seeds and awakens Nehellenia to lure Saturn out of hiding</span>.
</li><li> The last chapter in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> has a minion of the villain accusing the Senshi of causing the universe to generate bigger and badder villains.
</li><li> However this is ultimately averted in all its points:
<ul><li> While some villains come to Earth specifically because they need the Senshi's energy for their plans, the Senshi, without exception, are Awakened <em>because</em> of the villains. In particular, Minako initially refused to become Sailor Venus until she stumbled in her first youma and spends her entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">solo series</a> considering to retire, the Death Busters, who <em>do</em> need Sailor Moon's energy, are a problem only because the Outer Senshi didn't Awaken in time to wipe them out before they got entrenched, and Sailor Saturn is Awakened directly by the Death Busters' actions (and, in the manga, makes her comeback due the Dead Moon Circus' arrival).
</li><li> They're also extremely effective: the supervillains are ultimately taken down (either redeemed or outright killed), and it's a plot point that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">back when she went by Sailor V</a>, Sailor Venus single-handedly <em>wiped out all crime from Shiba Koen district and was branching out in the rest of Minato Ward</em> (and by all crime we mean <em>all</em> crime: she's shown stopping simple bullies more than once, and a police report mentions specifically she solved all cases from money counterfeiters to <em>panty thieves</em>), with the manga showing she's still making regular patrols alongside Sailor Moon.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, once Touma Kamijou made his presence known, several members of the Magic Side target him and his home Academy City, seeing the existence of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine Breaker</a> as an offense to God. Etzali, the Mitsuki Unabara imposter, even angrily tells Touma that if he had never shown up, his friends would have never been endangered. After Touma helped end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>, the organization GREMLIN was formed to counter him, willing to do things like attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> that would trigger a second Ice Age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">just to kill him</a></em>. Subverted in that many of these enemies had been in operation long before Touma showed up and had already been planning to attack Academy City; Touma just provided a scapegoat. Also, without Touma, many of them would have succeeded.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NegativeHeroAndGeneralOfTheDemonKingsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NegativeHeroAndGeneralOfTheDemonKingsArmy">Negative Hero And General Of The Demon Kings Army</a></em>: The titular hero lost her parents very young, because since evil monsters kept attacking the village to get at her, the villagers murdered her parents. By the time she's old enough to be sent against the demon general (after an upbringing implied to be anything but kind or well-meaning), she's just there to beg him to kill her so she can finally be reunited with her family. He's so utterly confused (and sympathetic) he gets her to stay as assistant librarian.

<ul><li> This happens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> so often that we might as well have called this the Batman Paradox. Batman's greatest success is breaking the mob's hold on Gotham and its government, but the question of whether it's his fault that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> of costumed freaks has risen in their place is always there, waiting to be asked.
<ul><li> Noted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em>, as seen on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/SuperheroParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/SuperheroParadox">Quotes page</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>, a psychologist claims Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> are the <em>real</em> victims — that Batman's actions were somehow responsible for their mental instability and criminal behavior. He's partly right, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> had given up supervillainy after Batman retired — then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">resumed his villainy after the Bat's return</a>. Then the psychologist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">declares the Joker rehabilitated, and then gets killed by him</a>. That said, the only reason Batman came back in the first place was because Gotham (and as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkKnightStrikesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkKnightStrikesAgain">The Dark Knight Strikes Again</a></em> shows, <em>the entire planet</em>) had degraded from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> to a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a>, so probably subverted.
</li><li> In the <em>Penguin Triumphant</em> graphic novel, a psychologist postulates that Batman is like a lightning rod for supervillains. But she argues that this is a good thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">pointing out what happens to buildings that don't have lightning rods</a>. Essentially she argues that the villains concentrate on Batman rather than doing even worse damage to Gotham.

Cold's attitude shifts when Barry comes back. He notes that the Rogues had Wally convinced it was all something of a game for years - he'd stop their crimes, but he'd also work with them against worse threats or during their various attempts to go straight. Barry, a cop, always treated the Rogues like what they are: dangerous criminals.
</li><li> Although Batman is often accused of this, when you start examining his rogues you see that he actually had less involvement in his villain's origins than most other superheroes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace">Two-Face</a> was a dual personality anyway, and is often associated more with Bruce Wayne than Batman.

The point is made that while yes, Batman's presence has caused the emergence of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperVillain">Super Villains</a>, he also stopped the corruption of the Gotham Police Department, which gave people hope in, in the very least, their own police force.
</li><li> In general, how much each rogue was "inspired" by Batman tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">vary</a> depending on continuity - and even different writers' interpretations in the same continuity (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> origin for Poison Ivy, for instance, had her become a supervillain because of her crush on Batman). The one rogue who <em>consistently</em> blows the whole "Batman creates/worsens his enemies!" theory to pieces is Ra's, who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> planning an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a> decades if not <em>centuries</em> before Bruce Wayne was even born. Indeed, his fixation on Batman as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> probably <em>defangs</em> him to an extent, since it often causes him to tip his hand more frequently than he would otherwise.

Spoiler quits the Bat-Family because she begins to agree with their beliefs, if not their methods.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a> aren't far off.
<ul><li> When mutants were defenseless, they weren't a big target. Once the X-Men came around and started defending mutants, anti-mutant crime exploded. William Stryker, The Sentinel Project and even some aspects of Weapon X probably wouldn't be nearly so strong in-universe if not for humans (unreasonably) feeling threatened by the X-Men, whom some in-universe view as a private mutant army. Even the Brotherhood has seemingly grown more powerful in backlash against the X-Men. And one could go on for <em>ages</em> about all the alien threats brought to Earth as a result of the X-Men.
</li><li> One X-Man villain is even cunning enough to take advantage of this. Cameron Hodge has the first five X-Men form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a>, which is supposed to be a mutant neutralization group, but secretly finds mutants and trains them. The amount of good X-Factor did (a lot) was far outweighed by the amount of anti-mutant hysteria they stirred up.
</li><li> On the other hand, it could be argued that anti-mutant paranoia started exploding when Magneto first attempted to hijack nuclear weapons with which to blackmail all of Earth — which was in Uncanny X-Men #1.
<ul><li> Actually, the sentient bacteria Sublime was using his psychic powers to stir up anti-mutant perspectives, given that mutants were immune to his powers and therefore, a threat to his domination of all living creatures. He even manipulated Stryker and started the Weapon X program.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, the new batch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntihero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntihero">Nineties Antiheroes</a> kill off all of the old supervillains and then proceed to tear up the world fighting each other because there aren't any more supervillains to fight.

But if you look closely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the superpowers seem to be patching things up by the time Ozymandias pulls off his plan, implying that they didn't do as much harm as they caused - <em>until</em> someone was dumb enough to try to clean up after them; what'll happen when the cover-up inevitably tumbles apart?</span>
<ul><li> And on a smaller scale, their existence causes a police strike <strike> in New York</strike> across the country, which in turn encourages rioting and looting, and requires an act of Congress to rectify (outlawing vigilantes).

Michael Straczynski</a> posits this theory during his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> as the reason why Spidey has so many enemies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a> — he is being assaulted by jealous pretenders who subconsciously realize that his power comes directly from its source. Magic is confusing.
<ul><li> J. Jonah Jameson had been claiming Spider-Man was an example of this for years before that whole storyline. This is actually true in the case of Mysterio, since he wanted to take out a superhero to become famous and picked Spider-Man since he thought he was weak and inexperienced. Jameson himself also helped create the Scorpion and the Spider-Slayers specifically to capture Spider-Man.
</li><li> This is actually invoked in Marvel Knights Spider-Man, where Spidey learns (from Mac Gargan of all people) that many of the villains who confront heroes on a regular basis, were actually created by organizations (mostly associated with white collar crime) as a way of distracting superheroes from noticing the crimes committed by these people and organizations.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is a magnet for criminals and alien powerhouses, it's worth noting that the "normal" human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a> is not harmless. Marvel's Rick Jones is an even more blatant counterpart. Superman is an interesting case, as (at least in current continuity) most of his biggest enemies were entrenched long before he arrived on the scene (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, Zod, Intergang) or created to dick with him personally (Bizarro, Metallo). Also the ones that already were there (the aforementioned Darkseid and Mongul come to mind, along many, many others) took interest in Earth <em>because</em> of Superman.

This begged the question, why amidst all this weirdness are there no superheroes? The answer is that there <em>used</em> to be. However, it eventually became clear to the cape n' spandex set that their high-profile adventures were <em>attracting</em> more superbaddies out of the woodwork, most specifically to challenge them. Their solution was to form Agency Zero, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a>-type organization of supers who still fight supernormal threats, but do it as quietly and anonymously as possible.

<ul><li> This plot point usually appears in non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">PKNA</a> Paperinik stories: some supervillains were born <em>specifically</em> to defeat Paperinik (in particular, the criminals of Duckburg created a fake superhero named Pap-Man to get Paperinik pensioned, and the "Super Anti Heroes" series had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> create a new supervillain every time specifically to defeat Paperinik), he himself admitted that some of his interventions caused enormous collateral damage, and in some occasions Daisy became reckless because she knew Paperinik would save her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">at least in stories where Daisy doesn't have a superhero alter ego herself and barely tolerates Paperinik</a>). On the flip side, there's the reason the criminals created supervillains specifically to deal with Paperinik: he's extremely good at dealing with criminals (at least four stories depict him arresting <em>every single criminal in Duckburg</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lhk7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lhk7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lhk7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In one he had already arrested most of them and only three (plus that story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>) remained between him and his well-deserved vacations, and he caught the first three before halfway during the story and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> at the end. In another he wanted his well-deserved vacations, so he roamed all of Duckburg like a predator instead of doing his usual patrol and captured them all. In the third he wanted the rich people of Duckburg to contribute to a park for the kids, and when they refused citing the expense of defending themselves from criminals he <em>lured them all in the same place before using a giant fishing net on them</em>. And in the fourth Gyro making an error in the maintenance of his gear caused him to suffer a series of defeats and the criminals spontaneously assembled in the same place-where Paperinik jumped them with repaired gear, <em>captured them all</em>, and restored his past aura of terror by claiming the defeats had been part of a plan to lure them in a single place to catch them all.</span>, and the Pap-Man one had him <em>visiting outsider criminals in their own homes to warn them away</em>), and without him Duckburg would be in much worse conditions.
</li><li> Even <em>Paperinik New Adventures</em> tackled the problem from time to time-namely, the Evronians sent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Trauma</a> to Duckburg specifically to <em>kill him</em>, and in one of the summer specials supervillains from the rest of the United States went to Duckburg just to challenge him.
</li><li> It's rarer in Super Goof stories, but once in a while a supervillain comes to Mouseton or is made specifically to defeat him. The most notable example is Megatop, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a superpowered robot</span> that Emil Eagle brings to Mouseton <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(apparently: he actually made it himself)</span> specifically to destroy Super Goof. The same stories also present a more positive side, because as long as the villains are busy with Super Goof they aren't trying to conquer the world (in the Megatop story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of Emil's underlings asks the other why their boss can't just build an army of Megatops and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> with those and the other reminds him that question annoys Emil</span>, hinting at Emil being just too fixated with Super Goof to do the pragmatic thing).

A number of citizens comment that Ms. Marvel's activities have led to problems and 'crazy New York sh*t' to come to Jersey City. However, what isn't noted is that a lot of the problems Ms. Marvel fights do not originate in direct response to her: The Inventor was already there, and the Inhuman and Hydra villains were either created at the same time she was, or were long existent. While a few incidents were caused by her presence, many of the issues the people are upset about would have been a thing regardless of if she had or hadn't taken up the mantle. Heck, many of the issues the (right wing) citizens put at her feet originate from <em>Loki</em>, who, while he did come to the city after she took up the mantle, was sent in response to the <em>Inventor's</em> actions, not Kamala's.

So the monsters are coming back too.

Not only does this result in damage and casualties whenever a villain pops out of nowhere to try to do that, the villains hunting the riders down also results in the villains learning monster civilization exists, which also leads to the villains kidnapping innocent monsters and dissecting them to make more powerful cyborg warriors. Compounding all this is how the heroes practically never fight villains who aren't attacking <em>them</em> specifically, which might mitigate the heroes' part in what happens. Instead they spend their time hanging out at their school until a villain appears out of the blue to try to capture them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">usually spoiling some fun activity the riders were trying to enjoy in the process</a>.

The Flash revitalized Central City, making it safer, happier, and even cleaner. Green Arrow however has turned Star City into a dying city, the economy has been in the toilet ever since the Undertaking (though corruption and greed,pre The Hood, lowered it first), hospitals have long wait times, there's constant violence, traffic delays due to construction and clean up crews, and schools have to have "vigilante drills" on top of active shooter drills.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em> deals with this head on:
<ul><li> It begins at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, when Gordon wonders aloud about what the criminals will do to keep up with Batman being on the side of the police, and then mentions this weird new hitter going around who uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">a playing card as his signature</a>. Then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, escalation is the main theme. The cops and organized crime were locked in a stalemate. Then Batman came and tipped the scales, and the existing criminal element didn't stand a chance against him. The Joker is explicitly named as crime's response to the Batman, a monster that didn't — couldn't — exist before Batman did. Nobody's very pleased with the thought.
</li><li> At the same time, the series also provides a strong argument for Batman's necessity. In <em>Batman Begins</em>, the League of Shadows intended to completely destroy Gotham, and had been planning to do so long before Batman came on the scene. Without Batman, they would have surely succeeded. Gotham City with the Joker, and the new age of supervillainy he heralds, is undeniably bad, and Batman caused it. But without Batman, there wouldn't <em>be</em> a Gotham City to terrorize.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The third movie</a> goes both ways: the events of the previous movie lead to all the criminals being arrested and Bruce Wayne to retire as Batman became an outlaw. Then arrives Bane and a reformed League of Shadows, forcing Bruce to take the cowl back. And again, if he didn't come back in the end there wouldn't be a Gotham.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em>, Jack Napier killed Batman's parents, creating Batman. Decades later, Batman knocks Jack into the vat of acid, creating his arch-nemesis, the Joker. This dynamic was passed on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a> and the DCAU, which is somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to the film.
</li><li> In the fictional "Under the Hood" documentary made for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> film, Moloch talks about how the arrival of super-villains was a reaction to the rise in costumed adventurers. He ominously comments that he's waiting for the arrival of Dr. Manhattan's nemesis... Which directly contradicts what Hollis Mason says in both the book and the film. In the <em>Watchmen</em> universe, costumed criminals came first (wearing disguises meant they couldn't be recognized), and crime fighters started wearing costumes to "finish what the law couldn't".

</li><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>. According to him, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> activated the Tesseract <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to create weapons capable of defending themselves from Asgardian-level threats</span>, they ironically sent the message to everyone in the galaxy that the Earth is ready for "a higher form of war." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a>, in turn, cites Thor himself and his arrival on Earth in New Mexico as an example of this trope and the reason S.H.I.E.L.D. was escalating in the first place, since Thor's fight with the Destroyer showed everyone that Earth is "hopelessly, <em>hilariously</em> outgunned" by pretty much every alien race out there. And as Thor's own films and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> show, he's not wrong.
</li><li> This is a major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>. After the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> (where Tony and Bruce created Ultron, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> that wipes out a country and nearly takes the rest of the world with it), the governments of the world craft the Sokovia Accords to control the Avengers, with the logic that the heroes are beginning to cause more problems than they actually end up solving. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a> even argues in favor of the Accords by pointing out that Earth has seen a massive upswing in both superheroes and supervillains in the years since the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> movie. And just to drive the point home, the villain is another one that was created as a direct result of the Avengers' actions: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zemo lost his home and family to Ultron and he swore revenge against the "heroes" who created him and then didn't even stick around to help clean up the wreckage afterward.</span> However, there's also the counterpoint that for three of the four examples given of Avengers causing collateral damage (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers (2012)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>, and the incident in Lagos at the beginning of the film), the incidents were <em>not</em> sparked by any of the heroes and they in fact blunted the potential harm the villains could inflict.
</li><li> The two that seem to be the most free from this trope are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>, the villain is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">HYDRA, having been reformed within S.H.I.E.L.D. while Captain America was presumed deceased, and Bucky's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> status can only be tangentially tied to Cap and was done while Cap was on ice</span>; while Thor tends to be the response to the villains - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em> had Loki, who was specifically out to get Thor and only put Earth in danger because Odin sent him there, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">second film's villains</a> were threats from before Thor's time and the whole universe was at risk, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">the third</a> was again before Thor's time and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was only a danger due to Odin's death releasing her from being sealed</span>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em>, in which the villain was created largely because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">previous incarnation</a> of the hero had <em>retired</em> from super-heroics, then mentored him. Even quitting the superhero shtick isn't an escape from this trope, apparently.
</li><li> One could argue that even the <em>First Avenger</em> exception isn't entirely an exception, as HYDRA would never have become a threat of such magnitude if Odin, one of the good guys, hadn't hidden the Tesseract on Earth in the first place.

In this case, because the Autobots have been killing Decepticons they find on Earth, they don't even have the excuse most such characters do. The Secretary of Defense suggested the Decepticons could only be on Earth to fight the Autobots, and asked whether they would leave if told. This complaint is muted with Optimus' suggesting that there is a risk in assuming that to be the case.
<div class="indent"><strong>Optimus:</strong> Freedom is your right. If you make that request, we will honor it. But... what if we leave, and you're wrong?
</div></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">the first movie</a>, this is inverted. The Decepticons are on Earth <em>first</em>, seeking Megatron, who was seeking the AllSpark. The only Autobot on Earth was Bumblebee, who was keeping a low profile. The other Autobots arrive to stop the Decepticons.
</li><li> Subverted once and for all in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">the third movie</a>- the Autobots actually <em>are</em> forced to leave by the government thanks to threats by the Decepticons...who promptly blow up the Autobots' space ship with a missile as they are leaving the planet, killing them all (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt">not really, of course</a>). The 'Cons then attack the city of Chicago and start to <em>massacre</em> everyone, and use the city as a base to summon the ruins of Cybertron with the goal of enslaving the human race and using them as slave labor to rebuild it. Though the Autobots being kicked out was partly prompted by one of them turning out to be a traitor, it is <em>also</em> revealed that the Decepticons had secretly been on Earth since the 1960's, so Optimus and co. had even less to do with their presence on Earth than they thought before.

This is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> though as while it originally appears that rogue elements in the government are taking the Transformers down because they are a threat (though it is made clear that the President and others are left in the dark), the motive of the main villain behind them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">pure greed</a>- the Autobots are harvested for parts and their technology refurbished for private use.

According to the tie-in comic, and implied by the movie itself, the super-villains more or less were all imprisoned or forcibly depowered by the government. Though a few more did manage to lie low...
</li><li> Part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> montage chronicling their success is a Larry King segment on them, mentioning the possibility that they were the very cause of the paranormal activity they combated. It could have been more an accusation that they were con-artists faking the incidents rather than that they were attracting ghosts. This is clearly wrong, as they invented the ghostbusting job <em>before</em> the paranormal activity was rising, and do such an excellent job that by the beginning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII">the sequel</a> they are jobless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, Kick-Ass became the first costumed hero, which inspired others to become heroes, but also inspired others to become costumed villains. Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss2">Kick-Ass 2</a></em>, the Motherfucker taunts Kick-Ass about how he created all the villains.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOBatmanMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOBatmanMovie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em>, all of the Batman continuities are canon, meaning Batman has been fighting crime in Gotham for nearly <em>80 years</em>. Barbara Gordon, succeeding the position of police commissioner after her father James, states this directly in her opening speech, declaring it's time Gotham try for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> methods to actually improve the city. Said methods include statistics, compassion, and turning Batman into a cop, all of which Batman himself finds very unexciting.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6">Big Hero 6</a></em>; the titular team is created with the objective of stopping Yokai.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, monsters, vengeful gods, and other beings have always existed, long before hunters. Even though the Winchesters had a hand in causing it, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">biblical apocalypse</a> (or the little of it we saw) could even be excused as being fated. However, that's only arc that was fated. The unleashing of the high demons in hell (season 3), the monster armies (season 6), the vengeful new "god" (season 6, 7), and the leviathans (season 7) were all directly caused by the Winchester's actions. For good measure, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> and loose lips even enabled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Azazel</a> to set all the fated stuff in motion.
</li><li> An interesting version exists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>, in the first episode Dexter mentions how low the homicide solve rate is in Miami. Obviously this would attract the criminal element into Miami and logically increase the numbers of murderers who Dexter can then target. And why is the solve rate so low? Probably due to the guy who keeps killing murderers before they are caught. By the time of later seasons, Dexter pretty blatantly tampers with evidence in order to make sure the serial killers stay off the radar so he can kill them. The police are usually good enough to catch onto them anyway, and sometimes Dexter has to tamper with evidence like this because he himself left evidence at the scene. Either way, he started actively sabotaging murder investigations from within, instead of only killing ones who definitely got away.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a>:
<ul><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>. Early in Season 2, Laurel comments about how there were no "earthquake machines and copycat archers" in Starling City before the Arrow first appeared. In the Season 3 premiere, the new Vertigo taunts the Arrow by suggesting that his existence gives fuel to the 'Vertigo' legacy.
<ul><li> For the most part, its averted in the case of Merlyn, Deadshot, China White and numerous other villains like them whose operations in Starling City and elsewhere have nothing to do with the Arrow; but played straight with villains like Deathstroke, Huntress, Cupid etc. whose origins the Arrow is responsible for in some way or the other.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally averted in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>. The large majority of metahumans were created at the same time by the particle accelerator explosion, heroic and villainous alike, so one didn't cause the other. Played straight in every season thereafter, as Barry and his friends always do something in the season finales that lead to another mess to clean up the following season.
<ul><li> Even the first season is a complicated instance, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> the Reverse-Flash is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a time-traveler. The particle accelerator originally went off in 2020. Centuries later, Eobard Thawne was somehow inspired by the existence of the original Flash to become his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>. Thawne then travels back in time to harass the original Flash, eventually getting trapped in the year 2000 without his powers. In order to get them back, he has to re-create the Flash; he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">takes the place of the accelerator's inventor Harrison Wells</a>, gets the accelerator up and running years ahead of schedule, and mentors Barry in his powers. So, <em>without</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> to simplify things, the Flash leads to the Reverse-Flash leads to the Flash leads to ow my head hurts</span>...
</li><li> Played straight in the second season. Thanks to the Flash futzing with time travel in the first season finale, wormholes to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> opened up thanks to a time paradox and now Central City has to deal with <em>their</em> supervillains as well as its own.
</li><li> The third season seemed to mirror the second - the Flash again messed with time, creating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a> (named "Flashpoint") that indirectly led to more supervillains even after he (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">almost</a>) put things back the way they were - but wound up playing it straight in a different way: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Savitar, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an evil "time remnant" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>-created clone) of Barry; which could not have been created if Barry wasn't the heroic Flash first</span>. He also claims that Flashpoint led to his creation, but it's possible that it would have happened anyway considering that the direct cause creating Savitar seems to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Savitar himself, attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">stabilize a time loop</a></span>.
</li><li> Flashpoint didn't create Savitar, it merely weakened the Speed Force enough to allow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Savitar to project into our dimension</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in Season 4. The team brought Barry back from exile in the Speed Force (and the need for exile was itself a consequence of the fight against Savitar), which caused a portal to open up and expose a busload of people to its energies, creating yet another batch of supervillains to deal with. However, as the season goes on it's explained that this season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the Thinker, was actually the one responsible. He gained his powers in the original accelerator explosion and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> who has been working behind the scenes ever since. He arranged for specific people to all be on the same bus at the same time, and manipulated Team Flash to open the portal right when all those people would be present to gain powers from it.
</li><li> It's discovered early in Season 5 that the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and some of the other villains are the result of Nora altering the timeline during the Season 4 finale. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The altered trajectory of the satellite debris has created meta-objects and turned a different man into Cicada.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This gets discussed the first time that <em>Arrow</em> and <em>The Flash</em> cross over, as Diggle is uncomfortable with all the weirdness the <em>Flash</em> crew deals with. Cisco points out that a bunch of both teams' weirdness was in play independently of the heroes, and suggests an inversion that Fate or God or something was making sure heroes were there to deal with it. The next season drives home the fact that the particle accelerator was merely the latest in a long line of super-weirdness, as it debuts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vixen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vixen">Vixen</a></em> (whose heroine's powers are mystical) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> (which involves both ancient immortals and time travel).
</li><li> Captain Cold played it straight in <em>The Flash</em>, as he was already a criminal but has upped his game because he enjoys the challenge the Flash provides - but then it's zigzagged since the Flash has dared him to carry out his heists nonlethally, <em>reducing</em> his overall threat level. Ultimately inverted; as with the Flash's encouragement he eventually becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>.
</li><li> Invoked during the "Invasion!" crossover. The Dominators believe metahumans are a menace, and specifically cite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Flash single-handedly creating the alternate Flashpoint timeline</span> as the tipping point that motivates them to invade Earth and wipe out all current and potential metahumans. Also, at one point, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> vigilante Wild Dog angrily says that bad guys with superpowers didn't start showing up until people like Flash did. When Wild Dog meets Supergirl and learns she is an alien, he accuses her of attracting the Dominators (though he's incorrect because Supergirl is from another dimension and Flash summoned her to help stop the Dominators). Additionally, the Dominators visited Earth before, during the original appearance of metahumans, like the Justice Society of America (a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a> [e.g. Commander Steel], metahumans [e.g. Obsidian], and people with mystical powers [e.g. the first Vixen]).
</li><li> The fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> is a direct result of the Legends' actions to stop the Season 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Mallus</a>. Apparently, Mallus wasn't the only thing that got out when the Legends allowed him to manifest physically in order to defeat him. A whole slew of magical creatures have escaped and are wreaking havoc across the timeline. This time, they need <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Constantine">Constantine</a>'s help in stopping them.
</li></ul></li><li> Being averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>. Unlike most portrayals of Batman where he starts out his career fighting regular criminals and corruption then builds up his Rogue's Gallery of supervillains, the show has the supervillains arriving well before: the Penguin is already a crime boss, Zsasz is a mob enforcer/serial killer, Edward Nygma has already gone nuts and is becoming the Riddler, and at least one character hinted to become the Joker is already an axe-crazy murderer. In the show's universe, it appears it will be the existence of the villains that will create the need for the Dark Knight.
</li><li> Claimed for <em>property</em> damage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl</a></em>, with Maxwell Lord (who, admittedly, is a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>) saying that they have risen dramatically in Metropolis since Superman's arrival, and arguing that National City does not need the Metropolis problem. The actual villains are a bit more complicated — they do seem to be on Earth as an indirect result of Kara, but it was completely unrelated to her actual superheroing (they just followed her pod out of the Phantom Zone once it get loose and headed for Earth again — twelve years before she even decided to be a superhero). It was instead the villains' escalating actions that triggered Kara making her superheroing entrance. On the other hand, Project Cadmus has started to create supervillains in direct opposition to Superman and Supergirl. Also, White Martians arriving to Earth tend to follow J'onn J'onzz, the last Green Martian <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or M'gann M'orzz, a repentant White Martian</span>. Played straight in Season 4, as Agent Liberty was created by his life gradually being ruined by all the alien stuff (previously, he was a firm supporter of alien rights), and Mercy Graves continues the work Lex started.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> One could argue that the franchise has this as a recurring problem, though the trope overall is zigzagged. For over 26 years now, different teams of Rangers have battled various villains, and somehow, no matter how old or recent the threats were, they always manage to arise or come to Earth during a very limited period of time.
</li><li> This was especially apparent during the Mighty Morphin days; while the original team was formed in response to Rita's escape from her prison, their repeated victories over her kept attracting new villains to Earth (Lord Zedd, Rito, Master Vile). Then again, starting after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em>, every villain faced has eventually been destroyed or redeemed, so while there's a wide range of threats in a concentrated period of time, the Power Rangers themselves have been pretty effective in destroying one ancient evil/galactic conqueror per year. It also helps that said villains arrived whilst underestimating Earth and the Power Rangers, so the argument can be made that the Rangers weren't even on their radar until actually losing to them. In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Divatox</a>, her grand plan just so happened to involve unleashing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> on Earth and the wizard whose powers she needs to do it with escaped there. She hadn't even heard of the Rangers, and even tried to call Rita for advice.
</li><li> This trope could frankly be averted given the implication of how active so much of the evil forces from the Zordon Era were in the greater universe, such that Earth's peacefulness is an outright anomaly, one that said villains wish to rectify. Without the Rangers, Earth would've been doomed to follow the rest of the universe, and any of Zordon's agents across the universe would have fallen sooner or later.
</li><li> Within an individual series, this is usually averted by having the villains show up first and the Rangers recruited to stop them.
</li><li> This is noted in the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers">Power Rangers: Beast Morphers</a></em> as Mayor Daniels is not happy that Morph-X is being used, since Morph-X is derived from the Morphin' Grid and quite a few villains have made plays for the powers. Indeed, this threat is why Grid Battleforce creates their Power Rangers team in the first place.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, part of the main character's angst is the realization that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">his desire to be a hero</a> is also paradoxically a desire for a villain to exist so that people will be in danger so he can rescue them. It's gleefully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> at the beginning by Kotomine, when Shirou is horrified that such a thing as the Holy Grail War exists, Kotomine tells him "Rejoice. For now you have a chance to be the hero you've always wanted to be."
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Hugo Strange taunts Batman with the idea that Gotham would be less of a hellhole if he wasn't around. A lot of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> focuses on the idea of <em>fixing</em> that.
</li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries">Batman: The Telltale Series</a></em> ends with Alfred bringing up this trope, arguing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Batman/Bruce Wayne is responsible for the creation of Two-Face, Lady Arkham and the Joker</a>, and the game tries to hammer this home by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">the villains' personalities and actions affected by the player's choices.</a> It culminates in Alfred leaving Bruce unless he agrees to stop being Batman.
</li><li> This is suggested to be partly why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> fell apart in the game's backstory. After Overwatch ended the Omnic Crisis and saved the world everybody loved them... until people realized that all the normal supervillains were still running around and causing trouble despite all the work Overwatch did. A sort-of in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> began to set in as people had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero">expected Overwatch to fix everything</a> and started to resent the organization. It finally exploded when footage leaked of Overwatch's Black Ops division using their heroic credibility to get away with assassinations, sabotage, and mad science, effectively 'creating' some of the villains they were 'supposed' to kill. Protests demanded they shut down the Black Ops division; the Black Ops division publicly declined with their guns, the official Overwatch team was forced to fight them, and the survivors of both teams were arrested or forced into hiding. Unfortunately, the threats did <em>not</em> go away with them, which is what ultimately prompts Winston to put the organization back together.
</li><li> The primary argument that J. Jonah Jameson gives in his opposition of Spider-Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4">Spider-Man (PS4)</a></em> is this, arguing that Spider-Man was the first masked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Differently Powered Individual</a> to appear in New York before various super-villains and unorthodox street gangs began surfacing. Half the time he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> that uses Spider-Man as a scapegoat, but a few instances show that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>, including the number of villains Peter seems to know personally (Mr. Negative and Doctor Octopus being two examples), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum">Evil Power Vacuum</a> Fisk's arrest brings about, and Spider-Man's general habit of escalating problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> starts out generally following a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Chosen One</a> narrative — except that people have noticed that the monsters arrived at about the same time the Chosen One did. As such, the player character is widely considered a beacon drawing the monsters to him. At best, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a>; at worst, some very powerful people are hunting him down on the grounds that they can stop the monsters from appearing if they kill him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>: if the main character is good, thus implying heroic intentions by the player: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he/she defeats his/her half-brother Sarevok, both of them being children of the god of murder Bhaal, thus becoming the Hero of Baldur's Gate. He/she is then challenged by Caelar Argent, who needs some drops of his/her divine blood for an ambitious task which ultimately turns into an epic challenge against an otherworldy mastermind. After solving this adventure, he/she attracts the interest of the evil archwizard Irenicus, who wants to steal his/her divine soul to get an immense power to achieve his goals. During the struggle against Irenicus, the protagonist is also involved with dangerous vampires, dragons and demons all aware of his heritage, trying to exploit or kill him/her. After defeating Irenicus and whatever came in between, the protagonist is now enough powerful to become a threat for the Five, his/her other siblings who are trying to resurrect Bhaal and serve as his lieutenants. In the process, war and massacres rage on the realms, because the Children of Bhaal are gathering armies to fulfill their goals (and the protagonist is blamed too although unguilty). While dealing with them and their hidden mastermind, the protagonist is now under observations by extraplanar entities and the gods themselves who have interest in his/her fate. During this, he or she is also questioned about his awareness of the escalation in challenges and of how becoming more powerful also attracts greater disasters. Ultimately, one of the possible ending choices is becoming a true god, in that case the epilogue states that the protagonist becomes a power of the planes, with new battles and enemies to fight where no mortal could. And all of this canonically in just a little more than a year of work, after leaving for the first time Candlekeep as a fragile level 1 adventurer.

<div class="indent"><strong>Brandon:</strong> It's kind of hard to explain.

<ul><li> Most incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> have this to an extent, since the Decepticons are usually depicted as following the Autobots to Earth. The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> is the most blatant example, since in this one the Autobots are pretty much seen by Detroit as superheroes.

</li><li> The girls also aren't welcome in other cities due to collateral damage: When they moved to the town of Citysville, they destroyed a bridge to stop some robbers. Rather than congratulate them on saving the day, the mayor scolded them for destroying the bridge, because the transit delay and repairs will cost more than the robbers actually stole.
</li><li> There's also an episode which addresses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero">third point</a> of this trope. The girls find the citizens are far too dependent on them, and refuse to help anymore so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">normal people</a> can defend themselves against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">lawyer-friendly stand-in</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Less Than Hero", where Fry, Leela, and Bender become superheroes; Leela mentions the collateral damage (and possible lawsuits spawned from it) as the number one reason to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>. Subverted later in that episode: after fighting off a villain trying to steal a priceless gem from a museum, its curator thanks them and states the price of the gem is a little higher than the cost to repair the museum.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderman">The Spectacular Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spidey (or ESU labs, which also created him) is responsible for the creation of almost every villain he fights. Examples include Venom (since it was him pissing off Brock that made him angry enough to bond with the symbiote), Shocker (who was employed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Man</a> to "squash the bug?"), Rhino and Sandman (who were <em>created</em> by the Big Man to distract Spidey), Kraven the Hunter (who came to New York to hunt Spider-Man), Electro (who was pushed over the edge by Spidey unfairly attacking him), and Molten Man, who was blackmailed into attacking Spidey.
</li><li> Pretty much lampshaded by J. Jonah Jameson in one episode. In his typical monologuing about why Spider-Man is evil, he brings up the fact that Spidey's appearance was followed by that of tons of costumed villains.
</li><li> On the other hand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Green Goblin</a>, easily the worst of any of his enemies, more or less created himself, and <em>then</em> went on to accidentally create Doctor Octopus by way of a failed assassination attempt (which was just the Goblin covering up the link between the Big Man and Norman Osborn, though granted said link was strengthened by the appearance of Spider-Man). Also most of these guys were villains already, Spidey just prompted the Big Man (a pre-established and dominant crime lord) to give them powers, which in the case of Shocker already existed. The Vulture (who has a vendetta against Norman Osborn), Chameleon (an established freelance spy), the Tinkerer (another freelancer), and to a lesser extent Mysterio (who was "inspired" by Spidey in his own way) also count as aversions.

Donatello worried that they might be "part of the problem" because most of the Shredder's schemes are or have become dedicated to killing them rather than world domination.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's an episode where the new DA of Gotham City wanted to arrest Batman, until she and Batman were captured in Arkham Asylum by the villains and Batman was put on trial by them for this trope. The ultimate conclusion, incidentally, was that in the Batman animated universe this trope worked both ways. While Batman may have inspired most of his foes to use the gimmicks they do, many would be out there causing mayhem regardless. (The villains even <em>agreed</em>— "And since we <em>are</em> all so nasty, rotten and depraved, we're going to waste you anyway!") That mayhem, incidentally, was what created Batman.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, various villains attacked Batmans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>: Kyodai Ken wanted revenge on Bruce Wayne in "Night of the Ninja." Roland Dagget hired Clayface to get rid of Bruce Wayne in "Feet of Clay", while Mr. Freeze wanted to destroy Bruce Waynes life in "Cold Comfort." Robin lampshades that Lock-Up was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a> for the Wayne Foundation in his eponymous episode. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm">Mask of the Phantasm</a></em> had Salvatore Valestra wanting to hire the Joker to kill Batman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Sleazy Politician</a> Councilman Arthur Reeves orders the police to chase the Batman with lethal force.
</li><li> Despite its highly episodic nature, the first two seasons chronicle the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> of the fall of traditional crime and the rise of supervillains in Gotham City. When the series begins the Joker and the Penguin are the only active supervillains (we see almost everyone else's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, and Rah's Al Ghul only comes to Gotham to meet the Batman). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> Roland Dagget runs the city, along with Rupert Thorne and Arnold Stromwell, traditional gangsters. Over the course of the series, Dagget gradually loses his fortune as legal fees and criminal charges catch up to him, and Thorne and Stromwell have their operations systematically taken apart as new, colorful villains appear in the scene. This comes to a head in "Batgirl Returns", when Dagget is arrested, and "Shadow of the Bat," where Thorne himself is arrested after another of his criminal operations is busted and it is revealed that Two-Face has been taking control of Gotham's mob behind the scenes. By the time of <em>The New Batman Adventures</em>, almost all criminal activities are the work of costumed and themed supervillains. Then we see Jack Ryder claiming on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">show</a> that Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">created</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> seven years ago...
</li></ul></li><li> Explored a little in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> where Shadow Thief is portrayed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a> of Hawkman's nature. Carter Hall wanted to be a hero, so his darker impulses manifested as a villain for him to fight. The moment Shadow Thief revealed this, Carter destroyed him. On the other hand, <em>JLU</em> actually <em>did</em> allow the heroes to have genuine, long-term victories. In the final season, Gorilla Grodd points out that the good guys, working together in the League, are so good at fighting crime that the supervillains <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">can't operate individually anymore</a></em>. And considering how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> leaves over half the villains dead or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended to a higher plane</a>, it's not much of a stretch to say that the remaining villains' days are numbered.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>: It's not until Terry becomes Batman that we get <em>genuine</em> super-villains again like Blight, Big Time, Shriek, Spellbinder, Stalker, and Willy Watt — many of whom Batman had a hand in creating, while others were already operational, and hit a bat-shaped wall when they came to Gotham. On the other hand Terry also has a tendency to see his villains (and a couple of Bruce's) get shut down. Permanently. Terry freely acknowledges that he created Blight (or at least that he caused his transformation, Powers was a criminal already) — and he's perfectly okay with that, as Blight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">ordered his father's death</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chief Rojas just will not stop bringing this up. The creators of the show state as much, by saying that Batman's work defeating organized crime in Gotham has opened the door for supervillains. The "heroes are ineffective" aspect is averted in the first episode where it's stated that Gotham is now the most crime-free city in the country. <em>Gotham</em>. Think about that.
</li><li> The vigilante Rumor also points this out, claiming that Batman drew the supervillains to him, "like moths to a flame", to the point where he can barely contain them.
</li></ul></li><li> Stated outright in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> Evidently the villains like the "arch" (as in -enemy) system, in which each is matched with a nemesis. Break up the system and you're just going to have a bunch of pissed-off guys with death rays, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> where it's established that the Justice League are so good at their job that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> forms a sophisticated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a> stand-in known as The Light which consists of himself and a cadre of other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Masterminds</a> using the bulk of Earth-based super villains as their minions.

Baby Man asks if there are any bad aliens in the universe, at which point Axe Cop wishes for every alien to be a bad guy so he can have something to do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> references this in part from Maria Hill being the most prominent thinker. There are some examples from the show proper which show this, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan">Wonder Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron">Ultron</a>, Kang as a borderline example or Red Hulk. However, for the most part, the Avengers in this show were thrust into a world at chaos, with villains like Loki releasing supervillains on the world as part of his gambit to take over Asgard, and most of the evil forces being active long before the Avengers ever formed. In fact, the Avengers manage to make things better on several occasions, by putting an end to long entrenched organizations like HYDRA or stopping long held wars like the Kree-Skrull war.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> did this a bit. Rojo only became a full-fledged supervillain because Vilgax needed someone to take down Ben. Ben's usage of Ghostfreak is what allowed him to escape from the Omnitrix. Kevin didn't go insane until he absorbed Ben's Omnitrix. Malware and Khyber showed up because they wanted information about the Omnitrix. The Megawhats were only released because Ben thought it would be funny to dick around and ignore the signs. Captain Nemesis became a villain because he was jealous of Ben. Psyphon only hates Ben because Ben took down Vilgax.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em>:

Their solution? Rebrand themselves as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime">Crimebusters</a></em> and clean up New Yorks criminal underworld.

The Ghostbusters have long since split up because there were no more ghosts in New York City. Unfortunately, some construction workers accidentally unleashed a powerful evil spirit, forcing Egon to gather a new generation of Ghostbusters to beat it. After it's been defeated, they think things will go back to normal, right? Unfortunately, that episode's villain wasn't the only ghost released, providing an explanation for the resurgence of ghosts in the series.

Multi-Farious was also a result from the same accident that gave the heroic trio their superpowers. Villains like The Gentleman and Mechanica also emerge due to the Flex Fighters's conflict against Stretch Monster. The only foes that have nothing to do with the main trio are Stretch Monster himself, the Tech Men, Anastasia, and Dr. Mindscape.

While this initially causes her to lose faith in her destiny, her mentor Tenzin encourages her to view it from the angle that it is the Avatar's destiny to <em>continuously</em> rebalance the world, in other words, to learn from the past and to adapt to the global changes, moving into the future.

<ul><li> However, this is untrue, as most of the villains that Big Hero 6 fought were criminals before they faced the team, or became villains on their own accord. Big Hero 6 is actually helping the city in keeping control of them, as the team's scientific knowledge and equipment allows them to combat against the supervillains that Cruz's police force are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">unable to handle on their own.</a>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed that Cruz suffered childhood trauma in seeing his father die at the hands of a villain when a past superhero was too late. So really, Cruz's hatred stems from one personal experience, and while certainly traumatic, he's too prideful to let go of his prejudice.</span>
