</p><p>This trope refers to when a revolution loses revolutionary zeal and appears to just repeat the pre-revolution business as usual, via self-motivated corruption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">bureaucratic inertia</a>. Names and rhetoric change, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">the injustices stay the same</a>.
</p><p>This has happened quite often, and for just the same reason that the phrase "The Revolution has been betrayed!" is such a cliché: egalitarian rhetoric is well and good, especially among those outside the establishment, but once an erstwhile egalitarian gets a taste of real power and discovers how sweet it is, they tend to get very willing very fast to remove, "by any means necessary", whatever obstacles stand between them and that power. This occurring not in a vacuum, but in competition with other revolutionaries who are making the same discovery at about the same time, the result generally is a multi-cornered dogfight in which the most ruthless bastard is extremely likely to be the last left standing — which tends to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">unfortunate consequences</a> for the masses, from whom said bastard will have risen, and which might just elevate someone else to supplant them unless they ensure their loyalty.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>One can argue that this trope generally applies if you take a surface-view of revolutions, i.e. the political layer of an autocratic system of government replaced with a more moderate/liberal/equal kind. Actual revolutions tend to be complex affairs and unleash changes across multiple layers of society and culture, and in addition to direct effects, there are also indirect effects, such as the threat of a radical revolution making reactionaries accede to moderate demands they formerly abhorred. So while revolutions historically and in fiction do feature shocking and depressing reversals it isn't necessarily the case that nothing changes either. On a less ideological note, this often happens because of a clash about what to revolutionize — do you want to alter an obsolete system of government and change the economy so that it favors the poor over the wealthy and privilege this over all other issues (Russia, communist revolutions generally)? Establish representative democracy while leaving socioeconomic issues as a bridge to cross on another day (America)? Or do both at the same time (France)? Or, in the case of pro-independence and anti-colonial revolutions, simply kick the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry">Occupiers Out of Our Country</a> and promote self-determination (India, Algeria, Egypt)? But it can also be removing from power those who prospered under the colonial regime, even if they were strictly limited in the positions they had held.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Ultimately, revolutions become civilized or uncivilized, based on clarity of immediate short-term interests, and they become violent when one, two or five factions clash on who's left and who's more right on a given issue and how pressing said issue is with the people.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a>; that, in fact, can naturally lead to this. Bloodbaths tend to make people lose fervor even when, in the case of the Terror, the bloodbath was demanded and enabled by popular fervor to start with.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss">Meet the New Boss</a>, for when the new villain doesn't even bother pretending to be any better than the one theyve just deposed. Sometimes the trope plays like a large-scale version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">He Who Fights Monsters</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>. For when the revolution was intended to place a new tyrant on the throne from the start, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPopulistUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPopulistUprising">Staged Populist Uprising</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution">Revolving Door Revolution</a> is when the new government is deposed by another, which is deposed by another <em>ad nauseam</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorseshoeEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorseshoeEffect">The Horseshoe Effect</a> is when two individuals or organizations claim to be ideological opponents, but in fact have a great many beliefs in common, and can be an underlying cause of this trope.
</p><p>This trope has very strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> connotations. Famous mathematician and physician Pierre-Simon de Laplace, who lived through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, coined the term <em>parabola of Revolution</em>: it began with the reign of the Bourbons, ascended like a parabola through constitutional monarchy, republic, reign of terror and pinnacled at Napoleon's empire; then it descended again through military defeats, restoration of the Bourbons, the 100 days' empire and Waterloo, and descended back to the reign of the Bourbons, just like a parabolic arc. In the ensuing decades, the arc would again shift, until finally settling into a republic.

The territory ruled by the Holy Arcadia Empire fragmented into several countries, with the largest being ruled by the branch family and becoming the Old Arcadia Empire. This proved to be no different from its predecessor, save for being patriarchal and lacking the advanced technology to actually carry out the worst atrocities. To a much lesser extent, this is true of the New Kingdom Atismata which replaced the Old Arcadia Empire. Some of the nobles remained in power through the revolution and continue to follow the Old Empire's principles, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though Queen Raffi eventually resorts to assassinating them. According to Fugil, the two houses of Arcadia spent millennia in a cycle of overthrowing each others' dictatorships, taking over, and falling to corruption, though occasionally a non-Arcadia will take over.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em>, Kino once traveled to a land with only a single resident. That man had led a revolution to overthrow the king, a tyrant who executed anyone who disagreed with him. He and his followers set up a democracy that put things to a popular vote, but executed everyone who disagreed with the majority. As a result, the vast majority of the populace ended up being executed until only the man and his wife were left, and the latter died of a disease due to a lack of doctors. As Kino is leaving, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">she calls the man "Your Highness," thereby saying that he's no better than the former king</a>.

When he returned years later, he found that they had earned their independence, but all that really changed was that instead of being exploited by foreigners, his people were now being exploited by a native-born Generalissimo, and many of his old friends were now rebelling against him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, this is why Kenshin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">gave up killing</a>. He had joined the Imperial forces to overthrow the corrupt and tyrannical Shogunate, but the Meiji government that followed was just as corrupt and tyrannical, and nothing had changed for the common people who Kenshin thought he was fighting for.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>:
<ul><li> Executed subtly in <em>Tintin and the Picaros</em>: during the course of the book, the heroes help Tintin's friend General Alcazar overthrow the despotic General Tapioca from the leadership of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic">San Theodoros</a> (mostly because said despot imprisoned Madame Castafiore and sentenced Thomson and Thompson to death). However, the penultimate panel of the book is almost a carbon copy of an earlier one (showing soldiers patrolling a slum filled with starving people), only a sign now reads "Viva Alcazar" instead of "Viva Tapioca" and their uniforms are slightly different, hinting that nothing important has changed. <br/><br/>Also, Alcazar wants to execute a whole lot of people, starting with Tapioca of course, and is only kept at bay because Tintin is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>, showing that Alcazar and Tapioca are as bad as each other. Tapioca actually consoles Alcazar over being stopped — that is, <em>the man who just overthrew him and wants to shoot him</em>, as he would have done the same thing (or more likely <em>did</em>), proving they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">not so different</a>. Similarly, the only reason Tintin became Alcazar's friend in the first place was because he ended up as his lieutenant. A few hours of slippage and he could have ended up as Tapioca's lieutenant just as easily.
</li><li> Earlier books such as <em>Broken Ear</em> would depict Alcazar and Tapioca committing <em>multiple</em> coups on a <em>daily</em> basis against each other, running this straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorRevolution">Revolving Door Revolution</a> territory. <em>Picaros</em> also reveals that Alcazar and Tapioca's shared desire for executing opposition has practically become a <em>cultural tradition</em> in San Theodoros, leading to a funny moment where both men grumble about how Tintin and the younger generation have no respect for the oldest customs.
</li></ul></li><li> There is an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> story where the Hulk (technically Bruce Banner who controlled his body as Hulk) was taken to a planet where a green race was enslaved by a red race.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a> protagonist, Juan, doesn't realize the truth until his wife and father-in-law have been executed for being Bible-believing Christians.

By the end of the story, the dictator is dead and rebels are in power - but they ship the scientists of the super-soldier program off to the US in exchange for the CIA owing them a favor. As Wolverine is barging in to tell them off, the ruling council is discussing ways to be better than the old dictator, and shooting down every one because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">the country is too fragile</a>.

Orion explains that soon after he overthrew his cruel tyrant of a father, he instituted free elections in an effort to get the people of Apokolips to govern themselves democratically. Instead, they promptly elected him to be their new monarch. "Such was my reward." For extra emphasis, Orion has started to look quite a bit like his father.

The comic explicitly notes that the fundamentalists were even <em>worse</em> than the Shah. For instance, under the Shah there were 10,000 political prisoners, while under the Islamic fundamentalists there were <em>100</em>,000 (many of whom were killed later).

<ul><li> As explained by Moldrock, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Corona used to be a desert world ruled by warriors where the two cities of the planet fought each other and oppressed the lesser villages, whose weakest people were cast away in the desert. This ended when Moldrock himself, one of those weaklings, stumbled on the Black Beam and its awesome power. With it, Moldrock turned the people of his village in an invincible army, personally obliterated any obstacle on the way to unification and peace, turned Corona into a paradise world... And then had the scientists create warships so Moldrock and his Horde could conquer new worlds</span>.
</li><li> As also explained by Moldrock, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this came to an end when Everett Ducklair and the scientists of Corona rebelled and used their technology to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">imprison Moldrock and his Horde in the Pentadimensional World</a>, where the Black Beam was weakened. Everett freed the worlds conquered by Moldrock and stepped down</span>... And after that came to power a matriarchal regime ruled by the mightiest ESPers of the planet with an iron fist.
<ul><li> In an interesting variant, each regime was better than the previous one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moldrock turned a desert world into a paradise and effectively brought an end to the endless wars of Corona</span>, and the matriarchs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">who genuinely believe they're doing the right thing</a>, are not trying to expand their rule over other worlds.

<div class="indent"> <em>Hurrah for revolution and more cannon-shot!</em> <br/><em>A beggar upon horseback lashes a beggar on foot.</em> <br/><em>Hurrah for revolution and cannon come again!</em> <br/><em>The beggars have changed places, but the lash goes on. </em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> has two fictional governments of this kind: the Committee of Public Safety (modeled exactly on the historical French dictatorship), which self-destructs spectacularly, and the restored constitutional Republic of Haven, which is mostly getting its act together but is still plagued by internal corruption.
<ul><li> When the Audobon Ballroom gets an opportunity to get a planet of their own, W.E.B. du Havel (head of the political wing) quickly realizes that there is a serious risk of this - sooner or later he will end up in a serious disagreement with Jeremy X (head of the militant wing), at which point Jeremy and/or his supporters will consider using violence to get their point across, a fight which Du Havel would pretty much be guaranteed to lose. He then proposes a system in which supreme authority is vested in a third party respected by both wings of the movement, who can hopefully keep the peace between them long enough for them to develop ways to resolve their disputes without tearing themselves apart. So far it's been working, but then again, Torch hasn't been independent for all that long.
</li></ul></li><li> Terry Pratchett's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> As noted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, revolutions usually end up simply replacing one set of bastards with another set. "That's why they're called 'revolutions' — they always come round again." In fact his city seems to have been very carefully set up this way on purpose; when the dust has settled and the Patrician is replaced, the loose group of guild leaders and nobles that <em>actually</em> run the place stay in power. (Until Vetinari came along and proved to be much better at the game than they were.)
</li><li> And previously to that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>, when Rincewind refuses to help the communist rebels against the Agatean Empire, one of the things he points out is that their plans amount to setting up exactly the same government that they're trying to overthrow, just with different names.

By the end of the tale, the pigs have become practically indistinguishable from their former human masters. It's implied that this is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Benjamin</a> makes no serious effort to convince the animals to overthrow the pigs, because the replacement leaders will just continue the cycle.

The extraordinary repression in Oceania is partly an attempt by the Party to prevent it from happening to them (largely, of course, they are just doing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>).

<ul><li> The ruling Targaryen dynasty is ousted by an alliance of powerful nobles and replaced by a Baratheon king. The new king doesn't kill people for amusement, but he's otherwise just as bad at ruling the kingdom, leaving it to his advisers and the feudal lords.

It takes five years after the New Republic is set up for it to finally dawn on Garm that Mothma isn't going to do this and just felt no one else should shoulder the burden of leadership.

After the first book, a constitutional monarchy is instituted, with a high-ranking noble who sympathized with the revolutionaries as king. Then he gets voted out by the assembly and replaced with a different high-ranking noble, then the original king becomes a theocratic emperor thanks to the same person who killed the original theocratic emperor. There's also a large segment of the population that wants to go back to the old system because, while it was extremely oppressive and they could literally be killed at any time for any reason, it was more successful at providing food.

</li><li> The Resistance Trilogy by Clive Egleton, set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Soviet-occupied Britain</a>. In the final novel the Soviets are pulling out of Britain due to war with China.

He contemplates how things came to this.
<div class="indent"> ....I understood, at last, how our revolution had gone from being the vanguard of political change to the rearguard hoarding power. In this transformation, we were not unusual. Hadnt the French and the Americans done exactly the same? Once revolutionaries themselves, they had become imperialists, colonizing and occupying our defiant little land, taking away our freedom in the name of saving us. Our revolution took considerably longer than theirs, and was considerably bloodier, but we made up for lost time. When it came to learning the worst habits of our French masters and their American replacements, we quickly proved ourselves the best.

After the overthrow of the King of New Britain, many revolutionary groups look like they're about to set up the same kind of police state that they'd overthrown.

<ul><li> The Trabe were a highly advanced, philosophical race for eons who also abused and oppressed the then-helpless and under-evolved Kazon, turning them into a slave-race. The reason the Kazon have so much in-fighting is because the Trabe bred that into their species to keep them under control. Finally, the Kazon were able to unite long enough to overthrow the Trabe and taking most of their technology for themselves, reducing the Trabe to scattered wanderers with no homeworld. Any small colonies of Trabe that are found are wiped out by the Kazon.
</li><li> The Hirogen were interstellar hunters who mercilessly pursued prey (which to them meant "every other species there is"). To keep them from attacking other species, Janeway gave them Holodeck technology, allowing them to create whatever prey they could imagine, in endless supply.

<div class="indent"> "The word palingenesia has multiple meanings, the biblical one being Last Judgement. The title of the record is therefore also an allusion to the fact that every rebirth, every revolution, already contains its own Last Judgement from the very beginning. That judgement is, as anyone whos watched the video to Ad Arma! Ad Arma! knows: Thou shalt scar the earth with barren furrows. A revolution starts with the incredible recklessness and optimism of youth, with an overload of energy  almost kinetic in nature  that may shatter the old world but, eventually, if history is any guide, will also devour its own children. It goes without saying that the judgement on our current world has already been uttered; it takes a lot of Valium to not hear the cracks, everywhere."

After giving her disconcerting advice about how they could go about undertaking an actual revolution, talking about her "forces" as if they're a formal army, Solas confesses that her lack of desire for a revolution confuses him, and Sera responds that there would be no point to it if the people replacing the nobles become just as bad.

He starts out with good intentions, but, partway through, he grows paranoid from the constant attacks and assassination attempts by the Wizard-Kings, eventually snapping and poisoning all his generals for fear of betrayal. After overthrowing the wizards, he forms a Barbarian empire and becomes just as ruthless as them, crushing all opposition and sending his forces to rape and pillage towns of the former wizard empire (he later finds out that his soldiers nearly killed his long-lost sister, who was saved by a former Bracaduun knight named Rion Gryphonheart, who would later marry her and found the Kingdom of Erathia).

The scriptwriter's notes reveal that said Barbarian Waerjak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is actually a Gryphonheart, meaning he is a descendant of Tarnum's sister.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism">Anarcho-primitivist</a> writer Kevin Tucker argues in his essay, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190316052603/https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-tucker-the-failure-of-revolution">The Failure of Revolution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, that <em>all</em> political revolutions are doomed to become this, because of the nature of human civilization and its inherent need to have power and control over the people within it in order to maintain itself.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> English "Revolution" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> followed the execution of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfStuart">Charles I</a> with the replacement of the monarchy with the Lord Protector <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>. Cromwell himself caught plenty of stick for not wishing to execute the King before the Second Civil War changed his mind.
<ul><li> Following the execution, various radical schemes offered by true reformers were tried, but eventually, as more and more people were brought back into the government structure, they began to drift back to pre-war forms, even offering the crown to Cromwell. And the circle did indeed became completely full as Cromwell forcibly dissolved the Rump Parliament, essentially the same kind of act as Charles I had performed and thereby caused the rebellion against him in the first place. In the end, they had returned to a monarchy in all but name, with Cromwell as Lord Protector, assisted by successive toothless legislatures. And after his son Richard succeeded him, this seemed to effectively start another dynasty, so they decided to stick with the old one and restored the Stuarts to the throne.
</li><li> Politically all this is true, but on a deeper level many things had changed. The Civil War strengthened the power of Parliament and led to the creation of the British Army, some of Cromwell's decrees such as bringing Jews back to England were quite positive. After the Restoration of Charles II, the Stuart dynasty was toppled in the 1688 Glorious Revolution which consolidated the power of Parliament permanently. Globally, the Civil War inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> to become an absolute monarch and start a top-down revolution in France to destroy feudalism and initiate the start of a more centralized kingdom and nation-state. So in the short-term, things seemed to have reversed but in the long-term things had changed, albeit not in ways that anyone on the ground fathomed at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> The Philippines suffered from this after the U.S. helped them overthrow Spain, which had colonized them a few hundred years before. They then had to endure being a colony of the U.S., along with enduring a bloody war against U.S. occupation that dragged on for 11 years, and was pretty much the Afghanistan war of the early 1900's. The Americans used similar tactics as the Spanish including massacring entire villages, forcing people into concentration camps, widespread torture, rape, and executions of civilians, none of which the US has ever apologized. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Japan invaded</a> and things got much worse. The US did leave after World War II though, in 1946.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x8eh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0x8eh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x8eh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> ...or did they?</span>
<ul><li> To say nothing of practically <em>every presidential administration since independence</em>. Here's how it goes: Candidate runs for president and promises to end the corruption and abuses of the sitting administration — Candidate is elected President — New President, in seeking to stay in power, pursues actions that could be construed as corrupt, incompetent, or repressive (and often a combination of all three). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mcng');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mcng" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mcng');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Public sentiment turned against sitting Presidents so quickly that during the Third Republic, no President ever won reelection to the second term allowed him by the 1935 Constitution, until Ferdinand Marcos, the would-be dictator, broke the trend in 1969.</span> — New Candidate arises and runs for president, promising to end the corruption and abuses of the sitting administration. — And so on <em>ad nauseam</em>.
</li><li> Among the Philippine Presidents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FerdinandMarcos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FerdinandMarcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> stands out as particularly egregious. Instead of stepping down in 1972 after two full terms as mandated by the Constitution, Marcos infamously declared martial law on the pretext of commmunist and Islamist-fueled unrest. He proceeded to purge his political rivals and the rivals of his business cronies, drive the activist student and labor movements underground, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">establish a new constitution</a> and reign until 1986. He framed his regime as the advent of a "New Society", a restoration of moral order. However, societal changes were mostly cosmetic with power being consolidated in the hands of the dictator, his family and their cronies and other allies. Marcos claimed to take back the country from the hands of oligarchs, but he merely replaced the previous oligarchs with ones favorable to him. The country was mired in corruption with Marcos and his family alone, let alone their cronies, stealing billions of <em>US dollars</em> from the public, and the foreign debt ballooned with its effects being felt to this day. He lifted martial law in 1981 as lip service to Pope John Paul II, but little changed.
</li><li> Marcos's downfall came with the People Power Revolution in 1986, when his regime was non-violently ousted from office through a combination of mass civilian demonstrations and withdrawal of military support. In some ways the aftermath was like a restoration of the old, pre-1972 orderwhile a democratic government with the requisite civil freedoms and all was restored after years of repression under the dictatorship and martial law, almost all of the post-Marcos politicians belong to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">same families</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic">that occupied the government</a> before Marcos, <em>himself</em> part of the old order, turned the country into a dictatorship (and new politicians elected in 1986 and beyond quickly created their own dynasties anyway). It doesn't even help that Marcos' widow, children and allies ended up taking political positions in 2010 which reaches to the point that Marcos' eldest son nearly won the Vice-Presidency. Even at the time, critics on the Left criticized the restored democracy as not being radical enough, while the military elements leaning to the Right attempted several coups-d'etat because they felt the new government was too soft on the Left.
</li></ul></li><li> Even in healthy democracies, where the ballot is meant to stand in place of the bullet, there are many cases where parties and candidates promise sweeping reforms, whip up much popular enthusiasm, only to maintain their predecessors' policies without substantial change, providing fodder for conspiracy theorists who see it as evidence of parties and institutions being part of secret societies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">Marxists and political scientists see this</a> as standard operating procedure for bargain-basement bourgeois capitalist democracy, reforms will always claim to be more sweeping in theory than it proves to be in practise, with at best only incremental changes, so as to better preserve pre-existing institutions and norms (political scientist view) and defend property and vested interests (Marxist). In actual practise, there are visible, tangible, practical changes and actual lasting policy achievements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">but nobody gets elected by promising moderate goals with realistic expectations</a>.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>, President Francois Mitterand became the first major Left-Wing President of the Fifth Republic, coming to power with a wide backing by left-liberals, socialists and communists. In the early years of his tenure, he actually put forth many leftist policies, increased taxation on wealth, and improved social services. But then the backlash with capital flight and the global turn to neoliberalism, the discrediting of the USSR which had an effect of discrediting even social democratic views, made him turn towards austerity, reduced taxes on wealth and in a way foreshadow the third-way turn that the American Democrats and the British Labour would follow under Clinton and Tony Blair, albeit while still preserving far more social democratic measures than his Anglo-Saxon counterparts. It made him a controversial figure in the French left with everyone seeing him as either a traitor or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut">Sell-Out</a>, and since then, no left-wing President has come to power, giving way to Centrists or Center-Right politicians, culminating in Francois Hollande who was seen as an improvement on the unpopular Nicholas Sarkozy but more or less confirmed the same policies of his predecessor.
</li><li> The election of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> brought the Labour Party back to power after almost two decades of the Conservative Party at Downing Street. It was accompanied by much joy and cheer among the English Left. That joy soured with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss">"New" Labour,</a> which largely continued and extended Thatcher-era under Blair, his hand-in-glove support of the American Government during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, to much in-fighting and bitterness among the English Left. Most notably, the playwright Harold Pinter admitted to regretting voting for Blair upon seeing him authorize support for the Iraq War. Indeed, on the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, Tony Blair admitted that he saw his job as merely building on the latter's policies. Critics got so supremely upset with New Labour that they were voted out by the Conservative Party after the failure of Blair's successor Gordon Brown, and Labour was until recently led by Jeremy Corbyn, a highly controversial figure whose views were considered fringe and far-left by the Blair-Brown faction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, like Blair, brought the Left back to power after 12 years of Conservative rule. In his campaign and in his First Term, Clinton identified himself as a moderate with a focus on the economy, and even used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s campaign slogan <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again">Make America Great Again<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. So Clinton's whole platform was a pivot against the Democrats' New Deal-LBJ legacy, and on coming to office, he made the Democrats focus on the professional class and likewise confirmed Reagan's NAFTA trade deal and more or less increased the deregulation and the fading away of welfare programs (described by Clinton as "the end of welfare as we have come to know it"). Towards the end, he did plan on bringing back old Democratic programs, including a Health Care proposal that was defeated by Congress.
</li></ul></li><li> This is what happened with Iran: the authoritarian and brutal monarchy of the Shah (backed by some western countries) was overthrown by a revolution that brought immense hopes of independence and justice. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">the Islamists came out on top of the revolution and imposed Islamic law</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">The Theocracy</a>, suppressing liberals, socialists, and others.

After over a month of protests throughout the country, the military took control from the totalitarian Burma Socialist Programme Party on September 18 and pledged elections, which occurred in 1990. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won 80% of the seats, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">which the military junta recognized at once and Burma became a free, prosperous nation</a>. Oh wait, no it didn't; the military denied the results, and placed Suu Kyi under house arrest, imposing their own repressive dictatorship on the Burmese people.
</li><li> The same thing happened in Mexico after the supposedly liberal Porfirio Díaz took power. The old aristocracy was simply replaced with an even more brutal plutocracy, and while the cities became modern, small towns were squeezed out of existence and their former denizens became <em>de facto</em> serfs living with inescapable debt in haciendas (they were even called peons, although that term existed before Díaz). Díaz was also perfectly willing to use force regularly, deploying his well-funded military and <em>Rurales</em> paramilitary to suppress strikes, peasant uprisings and the Yqui Indians. And it was invoked again, after Díaz resigned following armed uprisings ousting him from the Mexican Presidency, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMexicanRevolution">then a decade of bloody civil war</a>, and finally a new government meant to unify all Mexicans under one party took power. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Revolutionary_Party">Guess how<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War_%28Mexico%29">that turned out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Ancient China actually had a name for this trope: the "Dynastic Cycle." Essentially, it was the idea that an empire would rule until it became disapproved of by the gods, who would show their disapproval by some cosmic event (say, a lunar eclipse or a nasty series of natural disasters and famines). Following this, the people would rise and a new empire would begin, and the whole thing would happen all over again.
<ul><li> There is a proverb in Chinese, roughly translated as "only a madman celebrates the accession of a new dynasty", implying that nothing will change and it will be oppression as usual. It all makes sense if you believe in "intercalendary" dynasties.
</li><li> There were also other signs of "losing the Mandate of Heaven" that are suspiciously indicative of bad governing. Starvation (from poor irrigation policy), foreign invasions (from poor diplomatic policy), and even peasant revolts were all grounds for overthrowing the dynasty... if you pull it off. Which, in turn, is a clear sign that <em>you</em> possess the Mandate of Heaven!
</li><li> New dynasties were pretty good about trying to rectify the problems of the former dynasty, rebuilding the charitable granaries, lending support to farmers, and making the land bloom so everyone could have big, happy families and what not. It worked great... for about the 250 years or so it took for the country to become terribly overpopulated, then it was Malthusian crises all over again. This was all enforced by China's geography, China's massive river systems are extremely vulnerable to flooding, and an ineffective government would lead to broken levies and environmental disasters which were easy to perceive as divine punishment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a> was aware of this trope, and took steps to try and defy it. Unfortunately, his ideas of how to renew the revolutionary spirit of early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina">Red China</a> included the Cultural Revolution, which led to catastrophe, as did the Great Leap Forward, as it eventually caused famines across China.
</li></ul></li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, France has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem">had several governments</a> — Five Republics, Three Kings, Two Emperors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and Marshall Petain</a> with three revolutions in the 19th century alone (the July 1832 Revolution, the 1848 Revolution and the Paris Commune of 1871). Indeed, some historians consider the period between 1789 and the birth of the Third Republic to be one single extended revolutionary laboratory, where France experimented and shifted with many different forms of governments, and its citizens gained diverse experiences with power and protest. The Third Republic lasted for 70 years, surviving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> until it was toppled by the Nazis in WWII. After the war, France had a Fourth Republic that became divided on the Colonial issue of Algeria and the insurrectionary pieds-noirs and this led to calls for war hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> to be dictator. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">He instead gave Algeria its independence, established the Fifth Republic and preserved representative democracy</a>, although by creating the office of President in the Fifth Republic, DeGaulle created a powerful executive position that some liken to be more akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> than anything in the old republics.
</li><li> The 2011-2013 Egyptian revolution has spun around a few times, and may be approaching the ultimate example of this, with three examples as of this writing. Starting with a military-dominated, corrupt dictatorship led by Hosni Mubarak. Protests erupt in 2011, leading the military to get rid of Mubarak, and to promise to transition to a more democratic government. Over the next couple of years:
<ul><li> Transition starts to take place, with a parliament elected late 2011 and president elected late 2012. However, at the same time as the election, parliament gets dissolved and the military gives itself most important legal powers. The president (Morsi, associated with the Muslim Brotherhood) fires a bunch of military leaders, but also gives himself a large number of powers. Also starts working on a new constitution, which appears to give his own group too much power in an attempt to turn Egypt into a fundamentalist Islamic state.
</li><li> In 2013, in one of the purest examples of this trope in action, protests lead to the military overthrowing Morsi, arresting numerous Muslim Brotherhood leaders, violently (with hundreds of deaths) attacking protests, and other repressive measures, essentially bringing back roughly the same system that the country had started with in 2011.
</li></ul></li><li> Cuban dictator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro">Fidel Castro</a> who overthrew his predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FulgencioBatista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FulgencioBatista">Fulgencio Batista</a> in 1959, who himself overthrew the ineffective Carlos Prío Socarrás. Despite promises of being a better leader than the notoriously corrupt Batista (who had ties to American and Canadian mobsters), he's killed or driven out even more people than Batista ever did. However, there are some who argue that this is for the reason that he has ruled for far longer than Batista or indeed any other political leader before him (Batista was president from 1940-1944 and came back as a dictator from 1952-1958). While far from perfect is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">understatement</a>, there are those who would say that Castro is the lesser of the two evils compared to Batista, at least in some regards, which in their view makes this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example.
</li><li> During one of the (future) Decembrist gatherings, a clever guy once asked how they can be sure one of them won't become a dictator after the revolution. The person asked <em>really</em> hurried to change the subject....
</li><li> On a similar note, the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin commented on this, saying "If you took the most ardent revolutionary, vested him in absolute power, within a year he would be worse than the Tsar." He warned, presciently, that a "people's state" was likely to be no different than the ones that came before it.
<ul><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Stalin</a> agreed. He reportedly had this exchange with his mother, Ketevan Geladze:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ketevan</strong>: Josef, who are you now?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Stalin</strong>: Do you remember the Tsar? I'm like the Tsar.
</div></li><li> Stalin's mother also took note of this, saying he was now Tsar.
</li><li> Even with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, its influence still hangs over the modern Russian Federation. Under the leadership of Vladimir Putin (an ex-KGB agent), Russia has started to slide back into the authoritarian, militarist, and expansionst policies it practiced as the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire. He's repeatedly antagonized NATO by invading Ukraine, started a massive modernization and rearmament program for his military and nuclear arsenal, and has ruthlessly suppressed political dissent within Russia and abroad.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> averted this trope when some suggested that he should become king of the fledgling United States, noting that he had not overthrown King George the Third simply so that he could become King George the First. Likewise, he did not run for re-election after serving two terms as President, following the example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus">Cincinnatus</a>.
<ul><li> On a social level, there wasn't a great deal of difference pre-and-post Revolution America. Votes were restricted to property owners (just as it did in Parliamentary Britain), women were denied the vote (just as it did in Parliamentary Britain), slavery continued for nearly another hundred years, though some of the states in the post-Revolutionary period abolished slavery within state lines and the slave trade was itself abolished, while the British abolished the slave trade in 1807 and then slavery in 1833. Some historians have considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a> the "Second American Revolution" because it changed American society far more comprehensively and decisively than the first Revolution, namely for defining American democracy to be a purer embodiment of the ideals of the Declaration of Independence by abolishing slavery, as well as codifying America as a national ideal.
</li><li> From the view of the Native Americans and the Canadians, the new government was no improvement on Great Britain and in a lot of ways quite the opposite. The policies of Western Expansion being an explicit motivation and justification for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOf1812">The War of 1812</a>, which also involved a plan to expand Northwards and annex Canada, with this time, the latter repelling the invading Americans. Likewise, loyalists who supported Great Britian were forced off their property, with some amounts of violence (albeit not a great deal, and not out of organized policy) directed at them, many of them went to Canada to settle themselves. Likewise, there was controversial legislation like the 'alien and sedition' act and the whiskey rebellion (led by unpaid veterans of the American Revolution).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> believed that, to avert this trope, every nineteen years America needed to repeal every law on the books and hold a new Constitutional convention in order to adapt to the times and avoid becoming ossified. The phrase "Second American Revolution" was used when power was first peacefully handed over from one party to another when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> was elected. For many people, Jefferson is the emblematic representative of the failures of the American Revolution, since he wrote "all men are created equal" and voiced support for abolitionism, tentatively, in his youth while eventually becoming a slaveowner and a defender and representative of the South's plantation class.
</li><li> To the recently emancipated blacks, the end of Reconstruction after the Civil War and the rise of Jim Crow after the election of 1876 became this. Reconstruction saw many advances and gains for freedmen and saw expansion and franchise of blacks' voting rights, leading to black senators, congressmen and elected civil officials who faced violent revanchist backlash from the South, leading to the rise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> and other racist gangs that attacked black people at voting booths. It would take another 90 years before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> once again tried to honor and revive the Reconstruction era policies.
</li></ul></li><li> In German history, revolutions have never really enjoyed any real success, except indirectly.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848">Revolutions of 1848</a> failed and many Germans became international exiles as a result, but the failure inspired Bismarck's "revolution from above" as well as measures like social welfare and pension for the elderly, and a wide voting franchise intended to defuse or co-opt revolutionary tension. It didn't quite work, since Bismarck's revolution from above resulted in the creation of a highly autocratic military state that was an autocracy pretending to be a constitutional monarchy. The people would vote for representatives in the Reichstag, but really the Kaiser was calling all the shots, and the results of the elections were often blatantly ignored.
</li><li> After the war, Germany faced an actual revolution again, which forced the Kaiser to abdicate with Germany being declared a Republic, starting a dispute between Social Democrats and Communists. A Communist Revolution with some support from German workers and sailors broke out, (inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>) and this led to the formation of a Bavarian Soviet led by Kurt Eisner, who was killed when he tried to resign after he lost the election. The communists in Berlin were led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24qha');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24qha" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24qha');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Both of them were orthodox Marxists and rather critical of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, who to his credit, respected them enough to agree-to-disagree</span>. However, this faced a huge backlash and conservative Freikorps brutally suppressed them, and dumped Luxemburg's body in Berlin's Landswehr Canal, and this led many reactionaries to finally agree to a "real democracy" if only to keep the Commies from taking over.
</li><li> However, the Republic struggled for legitimacy since they were often divided between persecuting both the Communists and the Reactionaries. The circumstances of its formation (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy">Shocking Defeat Legacy</a>, massive loss of territory, seemingly endless economic problems) never went away, and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a> arrived, and hit Germany especially bad. The mood was ripe enough, the opposition was divided enough, that they <em>willingly voted</em> for an outright dictatorship<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qkoj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3qkoj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qkoj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Albeit Hitler only won with a slim margin and even that he managed via coalition with other parties and the 1933 elections were already conducted in a climate of intimidation with brownshirts as "associate police", which if it happened today would lead to international observers bemoaning "irregularities"</span> that was far more autocratic than the Kaisers ever were and didn't even attempt to hide its disdain for even the pre-war pretend democracy. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, East Germany split apart from West Germany because they saw the leadership filled with too many ex-Nazis and became a Communist state, and they ended up becoming a Communist dictatorship with mass surveillance and repression. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBonnRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBonnRepublic">The Bonn Republic</a> averted this however, as well as United Germany. However, the GDR did point out - rightly - that many Nazis had gotten off <em>very</em> lightly and some were even in positions of power in West Germany. The GDR very conveniently "forgot" to mention that it also had a bunch of ex-nazis in government positions. The unpleasant inescapable fact was that, after WWII, most of the people with experience of government in Germany tended to have been mid-level nazis, and they were unfortunately essential (even if discreetly employed as mid-level bureaucrats) to get government working again in <em>both</em> post-war Germanies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLargestDemocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLargestDemocracy">The Largest Democracy</a> and certainly one of the very few truly successful post-colonial states in terms of maintaining and building liberal institutions after an anti-colonialist revolt and agitation. Of course certain patterns tend to recur nonetheless.
<ul><li> Since independence, Indian politics has mostly been shaped either directly or overtly by the Gandhi-Nehru family. Which contrary to appearances is not a blood-relative to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> (Gandhi is actually a common surname). Three of Independent India's Prime Ministers, ruling collectively for nearly thirty four years come from this dynasty (Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi), two of whom have been assassinated. The family's de-facto leading the Congress party concluded even after it no longer put active family members in power. Dynastic politics and nepotism is so common in India that many have compared it to the Pre-Colonial Feudalism in modern dress, with a quarter of India's Parliament coming from a few top families who are also connected to business and other landholding interests, with many of them acting and living like Princes and royal families.
</li><li> Many saw the famous Indian Emergency as India becoming a dictatorship under Indira Gandhi, but after a year which saw mass arrests of her political opponents, draconian policies enforced by her son Sanjay Gandhi, she called off the Emergency and called for elections which she lost to the Janata Party (the predecessor to the much more right-wing BJP). But the latter collapsed in government and Indira Gandhi despite being controversial managed to get re-elected for a second term, which lasted until her assassination, with many seeing her re-election as a reversal of the anti-Emergency protest movement and loss of its gains.
</li><li> From the point of view of India's tribal population, the new Indian state is more or less another exploiter taking over their land to harvest its mineral wealth to better serve the interests of some distantly dwelling cities, much like All-India's status during British colonialism. Likewise, many of the colonial era laws and institutions are still enforced in India, with some of them, such as a homophobic law only recently being challenged and stricken down. India has also faced separatist movements, some of which are ongoing, who cite abuses and brutally crushed rebellions as justifications for wanting independence from India, similar as some critics have pointed out, to claims made by India against the British.
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese history practically runs on this - every faction that came into power get deposed later, often in ironically similar manners. To recap: the Fujiwara made themselves into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">regents for life</a>. Then they got kicked out by the Minamoto, who established a shogunate after a provincial revolt and a civil war. Then Hōjō repeated the same process as Fujiwara and made themselves regents for a shogun. Then they got kicked out by the Ashikaga... after a provincial revolt and a civil war. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod">Sengoku Jidai</a> later the Ashikaga were also deposed, this time by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>. After few year of turmoil, the Tokugawa shogunate was established... only to be toppled when (guess what) another provincial revolt and a civil war broke to put the emperor back on the throne.
<ul><li> Since the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>, modern Japan has largely been governed by the Liberal Democratic Party, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">contrary to its name</a> is actually a conservative party that was led and supported by the same individuals who supported Imperial Japan and its policies. With the exception of brief 3-year periods in the 90s and the 2000s, no other Japanese party has been able to contend its majority, and the current President and leader of the party, Shinzo Abe is the grandson of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobusuke_Kishi">Nobusuke_Kishi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who was detained and classified as a Type-A War Criminal.
</li></ul></li><li> During most of the 20th century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nicaragua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> was governed by a family of dictators who were either President or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">head of the national guard</a> until finally in 1979 people were fed up and a young revolutionary by the name of Daniel Ortega took over. The dictator family Somoza held most of the land worth holding and controlled the economy giving most businesses to family and friends. Among the most pervasive complaints against the various strongmen and dictatorships in Nicaragua is infinite reelection and when after the 1979-1990 Contra War peace was brokered under a new constitution, it explicitly forbade reelection and limited any given person to two (non-consecutive) presidential terms. In 2006 Daniel Ortega was elected President again with barely over 30% of the vote. And in 2011 he was reelected. And in 2016 he is again running for reelection. Today there is an Ortega friendly business elite and Ortega's wife is also quite wealthy. And as of 2018, he's in increasing trouble due to accusations of rigging elections and using the military as an attack dog against student protesters, much like the Somozas did before.
</li><li> Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. A civil war in the late 1970s led to the end of white-minority rule, and an independence ceremony featuring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a> performance the country became Zimbabwe. Within the decade, though, another civil war among the Africans led to some genocidal killings which even Mugabe later admitted was a mistake. Almost 40 years later, his ruling ZANU-PF has not given up power despite having survived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation">one of the worst bouts of hyperinflation ''ever''</a>, and the country would more accurately be called "Zim Bob's Way" as he maintains dictatorial control through his thuggish followers manhandling and intimidating his opponents far more thoroughly than Ian Smith's government ever did. While his fall from power in 2017 did bring some optimism, many Zimbabweans suspect that new president Emmerson Mnangagwa is going to be more of the same.
</li><li> Neighbouring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a> was born in its modern form in 1994, with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NelsonMandela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NelsonMandela">Nelson Mandela</a> ushering in an era of peace and reconciliation which only appeared to last as long as he did. Mandela's heir, Jacob Zuma, appears to have slipped into the depressing pattern of post-independence black African leaders, seeking to consolidiate power among his own cronies and eventually falling from power in a massive corruption scandal. The rand has plummeted in value, the economy is stagnant, and white South Africans are leaving the country in droves, suspecting what happened in Zimbabwe is going to happen to them too; given the country is moving towards Zimbabwe-style land-grabs that ultimately beggared the countriy's agriculture, it could be they are right.
</li><li> Afraid of potential Soviet domination, many Chileans concerned about the course their country seemed to be taking backed the September 11, 1973, military coup (allegedly supported by foreign intelligence agencies) that ousted the authoritarian and very controversial president Salvador Allende and installed Chilean military leaders in his place, on the expectation that the military government would be temporary. Instead, General <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> seized control for himself and proved more autocratic (and far more brutal) than Allende. Pinochet's government dealt with any resistance through a program of mass arrests that ended up with the arrestees either shipped to labor camps in remote and inhospitable regions of the country, missing and to this day presumed to have been unceremoniously and extralegally executed, or in exile where some of them were assassinated by Chilean agents ... all things that anyone who knows the history of the USSR under Stalin's rule <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">would find very familiar</a>. And so it remained for almost two decades.
</li><li> The Pueblo Indian Revolt was started because the Spanish were encroaching on their land, pitted indians that were friendly towards them against those that were not, forbade them from practicing their cultural traditions and religion, they even pitted child against parent, and the <em>encomienda</em> system guaranteed that every Indian within the landowner's territory had to pay tribute, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">and turned them into a servant of his estate.</a> Eventually, a medicine man named Popé conspired with other tribe leaders, and led a revolt that resulted in the destruction of several Spanish missions, massacred hundreds of settlers, and drove out the surviving Spanish out of New Mexico for almost ten years. When the Spanish came back, they learned that several Pueblo Indian tribes were at war with Popé and his followers because he felt he was their rightful leader and sought to extract tribute from the tribes liberated from the Spanish.
<ul><li> The new Spanish governor met with Popé's enemies and after compromising on the conditions that the Spanish would be allowed to resettle their colony so long as the <em>encomienda</em> system was abolished, they launched an offensive that defeated Popé's forces, and the Pueblo Indians never again revolted.
</li></ul></li><li> King Edward II of England and his close friend/possible lover Hugh Despenser the Younger alienated the masses and the nobles alike with their greedy and brutal acts. Eventually, Edward's wife Isabella the She-Wolf and her lover Roger Mortimer managed to rally the English behind them and depose the king with virtually no bloodshed. With Edward and Isabella's son Edward of Windsor — the future Edward III — still in his minority, the queen and Mortimer ruled in his stead... and they did many of the same things as Edward II. Realizing that their reign was no better than the former king's, the English rallied behind Edward III, who seized control of the country and executed Mortimer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars">The Chechnya Wars</a> served as this for the Chechens who for ages wanted independence from Russia. They managed to achieve it during the first war by tiring their superior and much larger opponent. Unfortunately, the war left them so devastated that their government was co-opted by Islamist terrorists who implemented sharia law and planned to expand across its neighboring republics and absorb them into their fundamentalist state. The disillusioned Chechens turned to the Russians for help who declared an second war to drive the terrorists out. They ended up succeeding... Unfortunately the pro-Kremlin president installed into power begins running Chechnya like a dictator implementing sharia law on the populace. As if that wasn't bad enough, he is also bullying his neighboring republics into surrendering bits of land into his territory...
</li><li> This regularly happens in the music industry, every time a bold, creative new sound becomes popular as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">a backlash against the stale music that came before it</a> only to have its most marketable elements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> for mass consumption, turning it into the new music establishment that the next wave of musicians rebels against.
<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> wave of the late '70s set the bloated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> of the early '70s squarely in its sights, blowing it out of the water only to quickly succumb to every record label wanting a piece of the pie. It's not for nothing that most punk rockers who wished to maintain a shred of creativity moved on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a>, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk">the next wave of punk</a> very studiously sought to avoid making the same mistake, spurning the mainstream record industry and instead relying on its own independent record labels and institutions.
</li><li> The release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind">Nevermind</a></em> in 1991 heralded a revolution against the hollowed-out corporate rock world of the late '80s, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> was neck-deep in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">permed-and-teased "sellout" phase</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRockStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishRockStar">rock musicians performatively acted like egomaniacs</a>. The success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">grunge</a> bands like Nirvana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a> signaled to the record industry that the great mass of rock fans wanted something different... which the labels took to mean "let's sign more bands that sound like Nirvana." At almost record speed, bands that once might have imitated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> started imitating the hip "Seattle sound" instead, and given that a key component of grunge's success was the perception of authenticity, music nerds turned against it just as fast. Nirvana frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> himself recognized that this had happened, and it played a not-insignificant role in his decision to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">kill himself</a>. By the end of the decade, what had come to be called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostGrunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostGrunge">Post-Grunge</a> was already sinking into the same excesses as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> before it.
</li><li> This led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock">Garage Rock</a> revival scene of the 2000s, spearheaded by bands like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStrokes">The Strokes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes">The White Stripes</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>. In the US, it never managed to fully overturn the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostGrunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostGrunge">Post-Grunge</a> establishment and thus retained the respect of critics and rock fans... but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">in the UK</a>, where it managed to blow a stagnant post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop">Britpop</a> rock world wide open and become the Next Big Thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">but it ended up outstaying its welcome to many UK critics by the end of the decade</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar">Simón Bolívar</a> is widely considered South America's greatest yet most tragic revolutionary hero. Under his leadership, he was able to break the nations of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama away from the Spanish Empire and attempted to unite them all under the flag of Gran Colombia, the South American equivalent of the United States. Unfortunately, the various political factions within these states could not agree on a constitution, which eventually broke down into infighting and violence. Bolívar was forced to take on emergency powers to try and keep the union together, but this only further incensed his political opponents who accused him of becoming another dictator. Eventually, Bolívar was forced to step down, and Gran Colombia broke up, with many of the liberated states eventually becoming repressive dicatorships themselves.
</li><li> Venezuela gradually began to suffer through this trope after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoChavez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoChavez">Hugo Chávez</a> came into power. The new president, who took over after years of corrupt governments, promised reforms and support for the poor, but ended up providing the first act for one of the worst humanitarian crisises on record by the time he died in office.
</li><li> The Haitian Revolution is widely known to be the world's first successful slave revolt, where the enslaved black Haitian population rose up against their French colonial masters and forced them out. Jean-Jacques Dessalines then rose to power and officially abolished slavery. However, due to Haiti's economy being ruined by the war, Dessaline was forced to institute serfdom, which his critics pointed out wasn't all that much different from slavery. In one particularly notable event, whips were outlawed due to being a symbol of slavery, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">thick heavy vines</a> were still allowed to be used in their place. Dessaline also personally oversaw the massacre of nearly all of Haiti's remaining white population. Dessaline was eventually assassinated and replaced, but Haiti would continue to be ruled by the existing class of wealthy freedmen controlling the impoverished rural farmers.
