</li><li> A case happens in the final boss fight, just a few minutes after the Giant Metroid event. The boss is almost dead, and it uses its most powerful, unavoidable attack.

At the completion of a level, Lara must jump into a well, which turns out to be much too deep for a survivable fall. Lara goes into her "death scream", then lands in the water. But the game goes on to the next level quickly enough not to worry players unduly. As long as you land in water that's deep enough to swim underwater in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">you can fall from any height and survive</a>.

In the Japanese version of the game, upon entering this room through sheer (bad) luck, you are treated to a message that claims that failure to complete this challenge will cause your game file to be erased and if you think you can't do it, you should press Start+Select+A+B to reset the game and start the stage over from beginning. Next, you have to frantically blast through the floor of a seemingly endless vertical shaft while a literal representation of your game file crashes down from above. In the (extremely) likely chance it eventually catches up to you and crushes you, it turns out that the game was only kidding, but even if you survive, you still have to redo a large portion of the level. The US version has the same room, but the effect is lost because there's no message and the tombstone graphic has been altered so that the text in it refers to your character instead of your save file, although the location is still called File Crasher on the map. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UerlRjBPBdc">Talk about fighting under pressure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

You're the Joker, escorting <em>Batman</em> into Arkham Asylum in a twisted parody of the opening sequence of the game (with the Scarecrow replacing the Bat-signal.) And he then shoots Batman in the <em>face</em>. It even goes so far as to show the game over screen with the helpful message to "Use the <em>middle</em> thumbstick (or "tilt the mouse" in the PC version) to dodge Joker's bullet"- wait, what? Whichever option you choose in the game over screen segues into another battle with the Scarecrow.</span> Furthermore, if you try to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">skip the twisted version of the opening cutscene, the game will prompt you to press the J button to skip.</span>

After a few of them, Gillian tries to use his position as a Junker to get close to one. However, the woman assures Gillian she doesn't need protection, as she's actually a snatcher herself! The noise for the motion indicator/snatcher warning sounds, and in the text at the bottom, you see, "Game over...?" After a few seconds, Gillian gets back up and is informed by Metal Gear that he passed out, and, provided he's alright, they should get back to the mission.

In one case, you go through a door only to run into multiple monsters and find out the door you just came through has been locked. When you die, the game tells you to "sleep" - and rather than go back in time, you wake up in a cell that you must escape.

However, he had to touch a "video game checkpoint" in the area just to reach the scorpions in the first place, and it will always instantly revive him. Otherwise throughout the games, you cannot die, and you can never lose.

<ul><li> At the end of the first episode, you go into a teleporter and are "killed" by a group of monsters.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jg6f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jg6f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jg6f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The floor is a special type of damaging floor that deals lava damage and then ends the level once you almost die; the monsters just make it go faster and feel more intense.</span> Then you find yourself on the lost moon of Deimos, which happens to have been transported into the Hell dimension.
</li><li> Some custom mapsets make use of this effect to take away all your weapons when transitioning between levels. (Depending on the source port you're using, this can be annoying if you keep reflexively pressing the quickload key as soon as you die, before the map transition happens.) The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> Doom</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a>, for example, has a level in which you were given a weapon you were unable to switch away from normally - the chainsaw, which in this case becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Ectomobile</a>, as the level in question has you driving from the Ghostbusters' HQ to the mayor's office. Arriving into the office's parking lot unexpectedly kills you so that you won't be stuck in the car in the next level.
</li><li> A quirk in the ACS used in Hexen (and, through porting, ZDOOM) allows for a level transition while the player is dead. Normal behavior for that situation is to "respawn" the player on the new level. With enough delicate scripting, it is possible in ZDOOM to note the entire inventory of a player before instant-killing them with a scripted death and then force a level transition to the next level, which would then give them their entire inventory back. Fission Mailed indeed.
</li><li> There's one point in the original Hexen WADfile where, to get to the next level and thus advance the plot, you <em>need</em> to stumble into a pit and fall to your apparent death (complete with scream); you're teleported to the new level before you actually hit bottom and die.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">First Encounter Assault Recon</a></em> games do this at several points, usually using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> in the process. For example, at one point your motion slows down, Alma starts walking towards you and the walls burst into flames. You try to run, then an explosion blows you out the window. Your teammates think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a>, but the Pointman is mostly unscathed.
<ul><li> Another major example is the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> battle at the end of <em>Project Origin</em>, while Alma is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raping Beckett</span>.

You are beaten severely by Civil Protection officers, and the screen blacks out. Soon after, you hear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Alyx Vance</a> kicking the shit out of them, and you wake up to a cheery "Dr. Freeman, I presume?" Several Fission Mailed instances are set up later in the game and throughout its Episodes, displaying overwhelming odds which are actually easy to overwhelm or evade if you know what you're doing, and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bits in the Citadel where you're being carried around through the Stalker Pod lines certainly seem like Freeman's death is inevitable</span>. Similarly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Episode One climaxes with the Citadel exploding, the speeding wave of energy quickly engulfing your train and Alyx shouting "Gordon!", at which point the credits roll. Freeman's survival is, of course, the starting point of Episode Two.</span> This is a callback to the first game, where one segment ends with you walking through a door — the screen blacks out, there are sounds of a scuffle, and then a HECU grunt is heard radioing in that "we got him." The next sequence begins with you escaping custody.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, immediately after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you kill Ryan and Atlas is revealed to be Fontaine</span>, the Little Sisters appear and guide you into a crawlspace to evade <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fontaine's security bots</span>.

Of course, there's the whole "You will just respawn there, so no big deal", but there are two specific moments, one in each game, where the fission must be mailed.

Catch is that there's NO WAY OUT! No matter what, you can only die to get out. But, as soon as you die, you get the chapter ending and you keep all you looted.</span>
</li><li> <em>Borderlands 2</em> is very straight-forward at this in one very specific moment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kill Yourself. No, seriously, it is a mission given by Handsome Jack. He has chosen a spot for you to commit suicide and gives you the choice of doing or not. It's hilarious, regardless of the outcome.</span>
</li><li> Also on <em>Borderlands 2</em>, there's Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty DLC. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Last mission involves you finding the "marked spot" that should lead to a vault full of loot. Instead, you get EATEN by Leviathan. The best part? He is taking you and her straight to the Vault, but the BEST part is... Do you remember her pet Roscoe? She found him!</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a></em>, you play as an agent of the Russian equivalent of the Secret Service, trying to protect the Russian President from an assassination attempt. At the end of the level, a helicopter arrives to rescue you, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it's Makarov. A "Mission Failed" indicator comes up, and Makarov takes the President prisoner, and kills you. Well, sort of. You're still able to get up, kick asses and save the President's daughter in the co-op mission, somehow.</span>
</li><li> The second mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a></em> sees you and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Atlas</a> squad tasked with rescuing the US President from a group of terrorist kidnappers. At the end of the mission, you and the President reach an armored car, but your bionic arm malfunctions before you can open it and a terrorist knocks you to the floor, shoots the President in the head, and takes aim at you... whereupon you find out it's just a VR simulation. Notably, once your arm gets fixed, you get to run the simulation again, and this time you succeed.

While it's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> puzzle, it's not quite the usual for this trope, since it's something the player has to deliberately set up using an auto-revive effect. Also, the sequel <em>Sorcerer</em> starts you off in an incredibly deadly landscape full of monsters. Then you wake up.

Every move you can make results in your immediate death, but every death is followed by the message <em>"But the curtain can be raised again..."</em> and you being taken back to the start of the duel.

The portal that leads from part 4 to part 5 triggers the death of everyone in the party (which, in any other quest, means people will recall out and try again), and teleports them to another room. After a few moments and a cutscene, everyone is revived (along with the 4 bosses fought in part 2) and the raid continues. The game does warn you something is about to happen right before you hit the portal. When the altar is used, the DM warns you: 'The trip to the Lost Moon will be traumatic: do not abandon your quest yet, trust in the Shroud...'

<ul><li> The game pulls one like these at Icecrown Citadel. In your fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arthas, the Lich King</span>, your whole raid will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">be killed, once Arthas reaches 10% health</span>. However, this is supposed to happen, and in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> moment, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tirion Fordring shatters Frostmourne with Ashbringer, releasing the spirit of Terenas Menethil II, who will resurrect the players, who then just have to beat on Arthas until he falls over</span>. The fight is basically won once this happens, as long as the players don't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">set their spirits free</span>
</li><li> When the fight was first available, the game actually DID let you release. Whether it was intended or not, it got hotfixed fairly quickly, in creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a> fashion. Currently, if you click the release button, it won't let you, and you'll get a creepy message that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Lich King has taken your soul</span>. Interestingly, you still automatically win the encounter if you don't accept the scripted resurrection. If no one in the raid accepts, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tirion Fordring will melee Arthas to death by himself</span>. This takes roughly about an hour to accomplish, though, given the boss' massive health pool.
</li><li> There's a quest where you need to kill yourself to talk to the ghost of the architect of Blackrock Depths. He'll tell you how to craft a master key to the doors in the dungeon. Made somewhat more obvious since Cataclysm as the game drops you off right next to him so long as you're in the general area of Blackrock Mountain.
</li><li> The first time you come face to face with Akama, you discover that instead of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, he is actually a deep cover mole. In order to preserve his cover, as soon as he hears one of the demons coming he kills you. You then have to lie there dead and listen to their conversation; he brings you back to life once the demon leaves.
</li><li> There's yet another quest chain in Zul'Drak where you're transported into the ghost world, complete with you in ghost form. Of course, you're not <em>completely</em> dead, just separated from your body, and when you die there, your corpse will be at where you entered the area instead of where you died.
</li><li> You do this in Howling Fjord as well, as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:The_Echo_of_Ymiron">part of the prep chain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Utgarde Keep. You end up confronting the Lich King while in spirit form, and he kills you while you're already a ghost. You have to corpse run and rez to hand in the quest afterward.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">Fission Mailed</a> is used even more extensively in the Cataclysm expansion, released in December 2010, which makes heavier use of cutscenes in general. In one such quest, you fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">big monster</a> called Iso'rath from its inside. To get the next part of the quest chain you have to die.
</li><li> One of the new quests in Azshara has you searching high and low for a missing blue dragon. It turns out he's off having an affair with one of the Spirit Healers (the creepy blue and white angels that preside over your spirit when you die in-game) which means that in order to meet him you have to... you guessed it... die.
</li><li> The boss Mandokir the Bloodlord will randomly decapitate party members (both in his original raid encounter and in the new heroic encounter), killing them and displaying the standard time to release. However, chained spirits will resurrect fallen players.
</li><li> Since the forsaken are zombies this happens to the character just before you start playing, in fact the very first NPC you encounter as a forsaken tells you that they thought you might not wake up after all.
</li><li> In the endgame patch for <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, there is a naval mission where you send out a destroyer and it gets sunk by the opposing force. The next phase of the mission is to build another more powerful boat to exact revenge.
</li><li> Near the end of a battle in the Death Knight introductory quest line, Tirion shows up and ruins everything, causing you to switch sides.
</li><li> In Antorus: The Burning Throne, the final phase of the fight begins with Argus the Unmaker pulling the entire raid into a singularity, filling them with blades, and bisecting them all with his scythe, triggering the standard death message. However, Eonar reveals the raid is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> and uses her powers to make a tree of life essence. Unlike the Icecrown Citadel example, you actually do need to release and use the tree to revive yourself, as the spirit world becomes part of the actual fight. Several of Argus's mechanics even become unavoidable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> to reflect this new mechanic. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>: the reason why the Army of the Light is invading Antorus to begin with is because Sargeras is using Argus's World Soul to revive his armies. The Legion is defeated because Eonar uses her powers to give him a taste of his own medicine.
</li><li> The War of Thorns Alliance quest "A Flicker of Hope" has you attempting to evacuate people trapped in a burning city. However, you're given a mere 3 minutes to rescue <em>982</em> civilians. While talking to them <em>does</em> make them leave in groups, there are rarely more than half a dozen together at once, meaning you'll be lucky to get fifty before the time runs out. When time does run out, you lose consciousness from smoke inhalation, get saved and evacuated yourself, and that part of the storyline concludes.

</li><li> It's also possible to <em>deliberately</em> destroy your hero to replace it with another, which will <em>not</em> result in losing.
</li><li> In the <em>Galakrond's Awakening</em> adventure, the Dragonslayer Skruk encounter pits you against an enemy with whopping 200 health (the norm for playable heroes is 30) and minions that get buffed in his hand every turn and will quickly overwhelm your hero. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once you take fatal damage, your hero, Chromie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">transforms into her real form</a>, that of a bronze dragon with mastery over time, gaining 60 health and a new Hero Power that makes you always take two turns instead of one.

</li><li> It is possible to die after delivering the finishing blow to some bosses. The death animation and message will play, but if you wait, the boss will die in the background and you will appear unharmed on the next screen.

An example of this is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Mecha-Birdo boss fight. Because this battle takes place in an area apart from the rest of the game, where you are teleported out when the enemy is defeated, you can exploit a simple glitch. If you deliver the final blow to Birdo and then die shortly thereafter, just sit around and wait. The event of teleporting you out of there will still continue, same as everything else in the game continues after you die.</span> In fact, it is possible to get smashed into the usual bloody pulp a split second after <em>killing the game's final boss</em>, and still trigger the final cutscene.

The first time you get killed by one, you are kidnapped and transported to Yahar'gul, an area that isn't normally accessed until much later in the game. You can't do very much here, since most of the area is blocked off until you're supposed to come here to progress the game, but there is some nice loot to pick up, you can fight Darkbeast Paarl and unlock the alternate entrance into Old Yharnam, allowing you to befriend Djura, and you can rescue Adella the nun, who will be dead if you don't come here until you're supposed to.

This is a particularly nerve-wracking example, since normally being defeated in battle causes you to lose all your precious equipment and have your save overwritten, and the player is actually capable of escaping the battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a> 3</em>, your first fight against Bass cannot be won, because he is surrounded by an impenetrable aura. He eventually defeats you, but instead of a game over, the next cutscene appears with Bass standing over Megaman in victory. Notably, if you bring over items from another game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo">which would have to have already gone far past this point in the plot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">you can remove Bass's barrier and take out his HP</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>: The first battle is extremely one-sided, and ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">the entire party being killed</a>, then revived in a nearby castle, which kickstarts the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>: When you first get to fight the Cloud Of Darkness, there's no way to keep her from vaporizing you and cutting your HP to zero. Don't waste a shuriken - you're not going to win, as she's too powerful at the time and it's pretty important to the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first real boss fight with Golbez starts with him paralyzing the entire party and summoning a dragon that proceeds to use a Death attack on each of your party members. Just as he is about to finish off Cecil, the Mist Dragon appears out of nowhere to defeat him and cure Cecil. Right after, Rydia (who summoned the Mist Dragon) rejoins the party mid-fight and the battle continues. Of course, the game also has its fair share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fights</a>. Note, however, that this fight comes immediately after a rather difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> fight. If Cecil is dead at the end of that fight, you won't have time to resurrect him before Golbez paralyzes and kills your entire party, causing a <em>genuine</em> Game Over.
</li><li> At one point in the game, the hero Cecil is forced to fight his old friend Kain. Kain is pretty much unbeatable in a normal game, having approximately 60,000 HP, and using attacks that are way too damaging to survive. But if you really crank out the level-grinding or use a cheat device to max out your stats and equipment, you can burn through all that HP and cause Kain to be "killed" on the battle screen. Cecil does the victory dance, but there are no rewards for winning, and when the game exits back to the normal field screen, Cecil slumps over in defeat while Kain stands triumphantly over him; essentially, the same thing as if you had lost.
</li><li> In the fight against the Dark Elf where you can't use any weapons and armor made of metal, you have to lose so Edward plays on his harp weakening the Elf. If you're not playing the DS version and reequip all your metal equipment before the battle (since you know it's throwaway), you're all paralyzed, so it's a Game Over. The DS version goes directly to the weaken cutscene if this happens.

<ul><li> The game has one of these in the opening sequence - after rescuing Joker aboard the exploding Normandy, Commander Shepard is flung into space where s/he asphyxiates and dies. The game then cuts to the <em>Mass Effect 2</em> logo, before continuing on to Shepard's revival thanks to Project Lazarus. What makes this example particularly clever is that, in Bioware's pre-release demonstrations, it was strongly implied that this particular scene was avoidable. So the game's biggest followers get a <em>real</em> shock.

Cless, however, gets back up and mentions that (dying from an arrow) would never happen. In the SFC version, you just lost hitpoints.
</li><li> The fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dozo and Okiyo in the Euclid Arena</span> qualifies, but it is possible to win with some extra grinding/Infinity Plus X swords available elsewhere (It goes up to Infinity Plus 5!)

<ul><li> During the final battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izanami</span>, it's impossible to kill her. Even if you knock down her health bar all the way, she'll wipe you out with an instant kill spell, at which point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Rise</a> will freak out, just as she does when you lose normally.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, there is a point towards the end of the game in which you must make a decision that will result in a game over if you choose the wrong dialogue option. Namely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you must decide whether or not to sell out your friends to Sae, the prosecutor questioning you. Doing so will result in a real game over, but you'd be forgiven for thinking you got a game over even if you don't choose to sell them out.</span> The cutscene that plays when you get a real game over and the cutscene that plays when you don't are almost identical, except in the latter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cutscene continues to show Joker isn't really dead.

</li><li> <em>The Maimed Gods Saga</em>, a fan campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, has this happen near the end when a corrupted paladin stabs you in the back to ensure you won't come back from a trial by fate scenario. You pass out from the resulting blood loss, but a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> saves you.
</li><li> To defeat the Norlac in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheImmortal">The Immortal</a></em>, you have to get yourself sucked into an apparently fatal whirlpool, so that the monster gets dragged in with you. If you try to go for the ladder, you get a real game over.
</li><li> <em>Dissidia 012</em>: upon starting a new game, it asks you if you mastered the original. If you say yes it pits you (Level 1 Lightning) against a level 120 Feral Chaos. Impossible to win but you don't get a penalty for losing.
</li><li> The Gamecube/Playstation 2/Xbox version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsTheThirdAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsTheThirdAge">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a></em> starts off with you being attacked by a pair of Nazgûl. After your first (useless) attack, one of them proceeds to "kill" you in a single hit. It turns out that you were only badly wounded, and you get rescued and patched up right away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a> 4 Ultimate</em> has one High Rank Caravan quest in which you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">capture a Rathian. Unfortunately, when you move in to finish the job, a Seregios shows up and chases her away. Since you've been prevented from capturing the monster, the quest is considered failed. Fortunately, the Caravaneer and the Guild award you with some cash and items as a consolation reward.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has one nearer to the end of the game in which your party can either surrender to or fight Ser Cauthrien and her rather sizable group of mooks. She's a tough enemy if you aren't sufficiently leveled, and while it is possible to defeat her it's not easy. Losing the fight doesn't kill you - instead the game treats it as though you had surrendered, and you're treated to an extra quest that has some of the funniest lines in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarawayStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarawayStory">Faraway Story</a></em> has a timed puzzle at the beginning of Chapter 6 where you have to cross a dimensional pathway in 5 seconds, otherwise the pathway will collapse and kill the party. Worse yet, there are all kinds of distractions like banana peels and a treasure chest, which will cause instant failure. Failing will cause a game over screen, but then the game will immediately dump you back to the prior scene where it turns out your failure was just a hypothetical scenario that Pia thought up, with different dialogue depending on how you died. Amusingly, after the pathway is stabilized, you can go back there to open the distracting chest and obtain the game over music.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FoodFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FoodFantasy">Food Fantasy</a></em> has an unwinnable battle the first time you fight Boston Lobster, to show how strong he is. Afterwards, his Attendant calls him off and leaves, continuing the story with no consequences to you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> contains a rather heartwarming example: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The reaction command to use the true power of the keyblade to finish off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Master Xehanort</a> fails and Sora is struck down.

The mission you're given is to destroy it before it escapes. If you succeed, you get congratulated and you eventually get the mission again.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>, once you piss off Mr. Resetti enough by abusing the reset button, he says he will erase all your data and will cause the screen to go black. A few seconds later, the screen returns to normal, and Resetti says "Gotcha!".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> series, most of the games since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature">Harvest Moon: Back to Nature</a></em> (PS) will trigger the credits sequence once you get married. But the game starts right back up as normal once they finish. Exceptions include <em>For Girl</em> (BTN's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>) and if you're playing as Tina in the PAL version of <em>Magical Melody</em>. In those cases, the game actually does end there. The NTSC version of <em>Magical Melody</em> still ends at marriage, if you marry Jamie.
</li><li> A variation on this happened in the early missions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekStarfleetAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekStarfleetAcademy">Starfleet Academy</a></em>. The early "tutorial" missions spend quite a bit of effort expressing how you should always follow orders, and failure to follow orders will result in a failed mission (which they do). Then, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in a mission where you're handling a culture's ancient artifact, you must specifically disobey orders to destroy it to pass the mission</span>. Given the mission's otherwise fairly mundane presentation, it's likely very nearly all players fell into this the first time around. Not only that, but disobeying orders as a requirement never comes up again.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em> games loved this. There are quite a few missions where you could fail some or all of the (usually mission-critical) primary objectives and still successfully finish the mission. These tend to be scripted storyline events, however: The Freespace games like to remind you every so often that it's the middle of a war, and in a war, you don't always win...
<ul><li> Fan mission designers usually take the same route, and occasionally get headaches when a player uses cheats to beat a mission they were supposed to lose and then complain about the game being broken. Some wiser mission designers will make joke scenarios occur if this happens, to make it clear to these players that this was not the way the mission was supposed to go.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter">Trauma Center</a></em>, this happens <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in Under the Knife 2, where Derek loses his Healing Touch and fails a couple operations.</span> Hilariously, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it will still say "operation successful", even if you've let Adel bleed out</span>. Even more amusingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the second of these two operations will yield the standard "The Medical Board will be notified" screen even though <em>it's training done in private.</em></span>
</li><li> A couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> missions will unavoidably fail your objectives partway through the mission, complete with a huge red Failed next to the objective, but instead of being given the 'Mission Terminated' or 'exiting the battlefield' prompt, it instead flashes new objectives to complete in order to succeed. For instance, one mission asks you to shanghai a convoy that you've jumped a few times before...only this time there's no convoy to capture. The game mails your fission...because this time it's an ambush that you now have to escape. Survive by either running or defeating all your opponents and the game will consider the mission successful that way instead.
</li><li> In hacking simulator <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hacknet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hacknet">Hacknet</a></em>, one early-game mission will lead to a pissed-off rival deleting a critical file from your system and then crashing it, dumping you at a text-only terminal interface. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In his arrogance, he didn't think you might have a practice machine in your network.

</li><li> Many, many times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">first game of all</a>:
<ul><li> In the fourth case, with the Game Over sequence, the <em>only</em> indication that you're supposed to let the Guilty verdict continue is that you weren't penalized. In fact, if you haven't been penalized at all, it will seem <em>very</em> weird, as the judge doesn't give you another chance, and you don't lose one of your markers. Also, the fact that you can't do <em>anything</em> to prevent the supposed Game Over. For someone playing through the first time, these vague indications are very easily overlooked. Unless you've failed before. One indicator is that, during the Judge's typical spiel, it cuts to Wright, who sweats and says something like "This doesn't look good... I'm sorry...".
</li><li> While not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> itself, there is a point in the 5th case where after failing to find something to convince the Judge about your points, he is ready to penalize you and your life marks show up (it could be a Game Over if you only had one mark left and the penalty was issued) to make it seem like he was for real. Cue in someone who prevents this from happening.
</li><li> In the second case, there's a point where the player has the choice to either take up Maya's case, or to just leave and go home. Picking to "go home", leads into a black screen with sad music, where Phoenix narrates how Maya was defended the following day by a state appointed lawyer, the case was a white wash against her, she was declared guilty, and he never saw Maya again, as the case remained unsolved forever. ...It then reveals this was just a scenario Phoenix was imagining. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">He declares that he's not going to let it happen, and takes the case.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Trials and Tribulations</em>:
<ul><li> In case 2, winning the second trial comes down to pressing a single statement in a particularly drawn-out testimony. Any selection you make leads to Godot informing you that you've failed to find anything substantive — but if you figured out the right one, Phoenix will point out the contradiction a few moments later.
</li><li> There's a fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> in the 3rd case that shows Phoenix losing his case to Winston Payne, his client getting a guilty verdict, and the courtroom doors closing. Given that it's the opening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">Cutscene</a> and you haven't even touched the controls yet, this isn't fooling anyone. You find out later on that it was actually someone who was impersonating Phoenix when the guilty verdict was issued.
</li><li> When you're required to give the last piece of evidence in "Bridge to the Turnabout", it won't matter what you present — Godot will say that he doesn't know what you're talking about, followed by an instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> if you presented the wrong one or Mia's brief mirage if you gave the right one. Because you only have one chance to present your proof, players have an enormous tendency to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> at this point, only for them to facepalm themselves and even yell at the game for fooling them <em><strong>big time</strong></em> at the climax of the trial.

<ul><li> In "The Rite of Turnabout", at the end of the first trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phoenix cannot disprove Nahyuta's argument. He knows that Maya is innocent but there is no information and evidence that can prove her innocence and the Judge finds her and Phoenix Wright (via Defense Culpability Act) Guilty. Before he passes judgement, the bailiff interrupts to point out a second victim and that Maya is the suspect of that murder as well. This gives one more day of investigation to turn everything around</span>.

However, in every route except for Ikki's, the Suspicion meter unavoidably maxes out at a certain point in the route when the guy figures out on their own that you have amnesia (or in Ukyo's case, start out aware of that fact) and it won't affect your chances of getting a good ending as long as you keep Affection and Trust high enough. In addition, Toma's route has a Doubt meter and while the heroine growing doubtful about Toma's actions doesn't seem like a good outcome, you actually need a high level of Doubt to get Toma's good ending even though certain...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">things</a></em>...happen after you get it high enough.

You cannot prevent this, as he's able to buy the arcade due to circumstances beyond your control. All seems lost for your player character, who has just had their dream ripped away from them, and you even get a "Game Over" screen—but it's followed by a "Continue" screen, after which your app assistant Iris intervenes, getting your best friend or love interest to pull you out of despair and inspire you to just establish a <em>new</em> arcade.</span>
</li><li> Later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after you establish a new arcade, things go wrong yet again, this time because Deco Nami hires a street gang to sabotage your arcade's first opening on the same day an "arcade critic" is set to review it, right after you have an unavoidable argument with your best friend or love interest. You even get <em>shot</em> when events really spiral out of control—but you later wake up in the hospital, it turns out you were only shot in the leg, and your best friend or love interest visits the hospital to apologize. Your courage even inspires the "arcade critic" to hold off her review for a week to give you a chance to turn your fortunes around.</span>

After a pointless quest is completed, the evil lord of the stage casts the Spell of Destruction, which will destroy the world in 30 seconds. There's no way to grind fast enough to be able to beat the boss, so the world ends up being destroyed no matter what you do. Fortunately, the Time Goddess comes to Hero's rescue in the next cutscene, sending him back to right when the evil lord cast the spell, but with her time powers so that the stage (as well as every one after that) can be completed in the 30 seconds.

However, this is just a recall in animation to the first time he lost, and instead, survives an attack with 10 life points left. The other two are against Dartz. When the Seal of Orichalcos starts to enclose around Yami, he manages to repel it twice. The first time was just due to Dartz being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> he is, coming extremely close to talking Yami into surrendering. The second time, Dartz managed to deplete all of his Life Points, and he only survived THAT thanks to a Trap Card he had hidden, Relay Soul, which enabled him to Summon a monster from his hand that would serve as the keeper of his life. That is, he would only lose the Duel when that monster was destroyed. It would be a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> if Dartz hadn't pulled the same trick with his Divine Serpent.

It's then revealed that it <em>was</em> a test. His trainer Walter Burke later explains that he didn't actually wash out; his apparent failure was staged to help establish his cover. Burke tells Clayton he actually did better than anyone in decades. Clayton isn't satisfied and tells Burke he thought he could have held out and not broken, but Burke tells him he couldn't have because the test doesn't stop until the trainee breaks.

It ends with the machine "rebooting" itself, until the words "JUST KIDDING!" appear in small letters. After that, Frog Frenzy starts.

<ul><li> First, in Hill Top Zone, Docfuture successfully defeats Metal Sonic but gets a Game Over screen anyway. After getting three such Game Overs, he suddenly advances to the next level with no explanation. It's suggested that Tails was deliberately causing these, just to screw with Docfuture.
</li><li> In the final video, Docfuture beats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel">Unexpected Shmup Finale</a> and the ending cutscene starts playing... then Sonic falls out of the sky and lands in an underwater level. An underwater level with no air bubbles, and no choice but to drown. This case was <em>definitely</em> caused by Tails screwing with Docfuture. It's followed by a cutscene where the boss of a prior level returns and explain that Tails turned against Docfuture because of mind control, and that he's now been cured, so the game can be completed.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Akinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Akinator">Akinator</a> sometimes only guesses the wrong character because he tries to guess too quickly. Click "Yes" to continue, and the second time he guesses, he'll usually be right. (For example, answering questions in a certain way may cause him to guess "Urdnot Wrex" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series. If you were thinking of "Urdnot Grunt" instead, who superficially has a lot of similar characteristics but isn't as famous and therefore wouldn't spring to mind as quickly, rest assured that he'll answer "Grunt" the second time he tries to venture a guess after you've given him more information.) There's always a 90% chance he'll guess correctly after four or five tries.

<ul><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>, Daria and Quinn are driving out to the middle of nowhere to bail Jane and Trent's band out of jail. At one point they pick up a cute drifter who flirts with Quinn before they drop him back off. A little while later, Daria panics when she realizes he stole their bail money. Cue the "We'll be right back" scene... which suddenly cuts back to the show as Quinn explains what <em>really</em> happened: <em>she</em> spent the money to buy him things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the two-part Season 2 finale, at the end of the first part it looks like Twilight Sparkle falsely accused an innocent Princess Cadence of being evil, and disrupted the wedding to boot. Twilight Sparkle's chastised by her friends, her brother, and her mentor, and it looks like Twilight Sparkle has just screwed everything up and alienated everyone she ever cared about... only for Princess Cadence to seemingly drag Twilight Sparkle to hell. End Part 1! In Part 2, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Cadence is secretly an impostor named Queen Chrysalis who's plotting to rule Equestria and gain infinite love energy for her subjects, and Twilight Sparkle's suspicions were correct. Then Twilight Sparkle is able to expose the impostor and indirectly contribute to saving the day.</span>
</li><li> The Season 3 opening. Twilight Sparkle ventures into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">King</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror">Sombra</a>'s palace in order to retrieve the Crystal Heart to stop him. After spending some time trying to open a magical door, she finally blasts it with Sombra's own dark magic in desperation. It opens... Twilight walks in, and ends up in Canterlot's royal hall, where a cold, angry Celestia tells her she has failed to stop Sombra, failed her test, and is not worthy of being her student. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except this is just a vision of her greatest fear, a spell triggered whenever someone attempts to open the door with anything but dark magic. Spike snaps her out of it.</span>
