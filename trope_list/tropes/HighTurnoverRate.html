Apparently it's due to Yato not being able to provide for their daily needs, being a homeless unknown minor deity who doesn't even have a shrine. He also apparently doesn't smell very pleasant and the <em>shinki</em> complain of his sweaty hands.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Remote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Remote">Remote</a></em>, the Unsolved Crimes Division, Special Unit A is renowned for this, as Inspector Himuro puts a lot of strain on his legwork partner with his special quirks and demanding personality. The heroine and newest legwork partner, Ayaki, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a>, nearly breaks down and resign from the post several times at the beginning of the series, until she gets used to the job and to Himuro's personality.

The complaints people had about <em>Avengers Disassembled</em> and <em>New Avengers</em> changing rosters suddenly and dramatically were par for the course. Jarvis reflects on this in <em>The Avengers #280</em> (written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerStern">Roger Stern</a>) where he's hospitalized after the events of <em>Under Siege</em>:

The rating has increased since then.

<ul><li> The office of Chief Judge (pretty much the dictator of Mega City One) has seen a pretty high turnover rate since the start of the comic, with many not being in office for more than five years tops.

<ul><li> Lordship of Harrenhal is another. The castle has had several owners (ranging from careful to catastrophic) throughout its history, due to the fact that every house or individual that has held it has suffered a disastrous end.

The problem comes from the fact that grimspace travel is like an addictive drug for Jumpers, causing them to experience orgasmic euphoria when jumping. Not only can this have severe psychological effects, but it can also cause brain lesions to form, which results in Jumpers eventually making a jump and coming out of it brain dead. This is called "navigator burnout syndrome" and means that Jumpers rarely live past 30, being constantly replaced; even individual ships will frequently go through multiple Jumpers throughout their active service.

His third deputy was his son Brokentail, who shortly afterward murdered his father to take the leadership position.

They also breed explosively, by asexually and passively shedding spores throughout their lifetime, but especially at death. That means that their style of war not only has a high attrition rate, but <em>relies on it</em> so that conflict can replace casualties, and, if no countermeasures are put in place, bolster their numbers and make them stronger as a conflict grinds on. On worlds where Orks are the sole inhabitants (or if they wiped out everything else), Ork tribes make war on each other until they reach a "critical mass" and a leader unifies the tribes and finds a way to travel to other worlds in a combination holy war and mass migration (also a twisted form of pub crawl, since Orks also <em>love</em> to fight).

<ul><li> Debt Collection has an extremely high turn-over rate, with nearly 85% of callers quitting within a year of being hired. The same can be applied to telemarketers, or really any job where you have to call strangers with the objective of getting money. Getting yelled at on a daily basis is not a terribly great incentive.
<ul><li> Often true for those <em>receiving</em> the calls from strangers as well, such as in customer service. It is slightly better in that the customer had to call you rather than the other way around, but they are usually no less angry. Unfortunately, the customer service rep is often powerless to do much more than take the complaint. In addition to angry customers, the rep may have to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">incompetent users</a>, especially for customer service relating to technical products such as computers or mobile devices. Trying to explain (seemingly) simple instructions to a tech-illiterate customer over and over every single day gets tiresome very quickly. That's not even counting those who wind up being the fifth or sixth representative to get an increasingly irate customer who got shuffled around by other reps who didn't want to deal with them, or who have to explain to businesses that what the sales department promised them was impossible, and that they were lied to, and that no, there is no eleventh-hour magic that can be worked.
</li></ul></li><li> According to Eric Schlosser's <em>Fast Food Nation</em>, most major fast-food chains have a 100% turnover rate every year, with the average employee lasting only three months. McDonald's, in particular, is a big offender, and managers have been known to bonus based on how many employees they fire (which saves the company the expense of offering perks like health insurance and PTO). Do note that as with most franchises, different managers may be treated differently especially as the economy changes.
</li><li> The New York Stock Exchange also has high quitting rates, mostly the ones on the floor.
</li><li> Being a freelance mercenary has one of the highest attrition rates of any job, and there is an epic list of reasons for this. 1. The work is illegal, so no protections or benefits. 2. Places where you do work suck. 3. The work is often very boring. 4. People who go in for this are often unpleasant if not vile, and fuckups to boot. 5. The pay is not great. 6. Boredom will make you 'crave' anything for stimulation. 6. Employers like to exploit and underpay. 7. You can literally get killed doing this. 8. All the stresses of being in a war with none of the perks of being a 'real' soldier. 9. Most mercs are highly opportunistic. If you find yourself with a band that consistently pays what they promise on time, isn't full of people who spend more time addled than sober, and actually participates in combat operations, it's a keeper. There is a reason why old-school "wild geese" are dying out and replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a>, who offer much better job prospects for recruits.

</li><li> The retail industry (at least at the store level) sometimes have a turnover rate over 100% for part timers - how is that possible, you ask? It occurs when all positions have been refilled more than once in a given year. Full timers average 60% turnover. Anyone who has worked retail can attest that these figures are pretty accurate.
<ul><li> Awkward hours, pay that averages only slightly better than fast food, and constant abuse from customers and corporate don't quite foster faith and loyalty in an organization.
</li><li> Sometimes it's done deliberately. Since operating a cash register and stocking shelves doesn't require a lot of skill, some managers encourage turnover to get the experienced (and more expensive) employees out of the way so newer (and cheaper) replacements can come in. Since some places offer mandatory pay increases after a probationary period, some places encourage "constructive discharge" by making the employees so miserable they want to quit.
</li><li> And many of the retail positions are seasonal, such as the Christmas rush. A lot of stores hire large numbers of people to help out in late October and early November, and then let most of those people go sometime in January.

Because the PMs are the primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapeGoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapeGoat">Scape Goat</a> for bad governmental policies, they tend only to last until the next party scandal or cock-up.
</li><li> Throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, there has been a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor">Black Humor</a> amongst the American intelligence community is that this is the case for the third-in-command for Al Qaeda, the job position evidently hitting that sweet spot between low enough in the chain to require exposing himself to actually do his job, and being high enough in the chain to make him a high-value target for one of the most powerful modern militaries in the world.
</li><li> Becoming more and more the case throughout the world as the ruling class attempts to push business (and other endeavors) toward a "lean" or "agile" model, replacing long-term, secure jobs with benefits with short-term, lower-paid, unbenefited positions. The economic and psychological costs are immense, but since these costs fall on relatively powerless people instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">those who benefit from such penny-pinching policies and control the media and government</a>, they are little discussed.
</li><li> Special Operations. Everything about it is apt to make even the toughest bastards wash out or give up. The work inside is just as harsh and demanding. The physical stresses of the job aside (one of the main reasons people leave special operations units are training injuries), specs ops is a highly stressful, difficult, dangerous lifestyle, and you can't talk about anything. Imagine seeing your best friend captured and then burnt alive with Molotov Cocktails and then having to pretend nothing happened.
</li><li> Library/information science, especially the desk clerks and shelvers. They are either going to school and working there temporarily or using it as a starting point to move up to higher positions later. Director,reference and computer jobs aren't this,though.
</li><li> College sports, by definition. With rare exceptions (such as an extra year of eligibility due to an injury), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">college football</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">basketball</a> players spend at most four years with their schools' teams, and that's only if they don't transfer or declare for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> draft before what would otherwise be their senior year. Because of the cyclical nature of college athletics, fans of college football and basketball teams, as compared to their pro counterparts, tend to support the team as a whole to a much greater degree than showing their devotion to individual players, because the nature of college sports makes long-term loyalty to any one player impossible (unless such a fan follows the player with his pro team while continuing to cheer on the college team with the new players, which many fans do).
</li><li> High turnover in college sports isn't restricted to players. Most coaches, especially in the so-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">"revenue sports"</a> of football and men's basketball, are always on the lookout for their next positionwhether it's a head coach moving to a higher-profile program (and often bringing assistants along); a dismissed coach finding a new landing spot; or an assistant moving on to a better assistant job, or becoming a head coach.
<ul><li> An extreme example of this coaching turnover took place in Arkansas State football in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">2010s</a>:
<ul><li> 2010: After a second consecutive 48 season, the Red Wolves let head coach Steve Roberts go, replacing him with offensive coordinator Hugh Freeze.
</li><li> 2011: The Red Wolves dramatically improve, winning the Sun Belt Conference title and finishing the regular season 102. Freeze then takes the head coaching job at Ole Miss, taking four assistants with him. They lose their bowl game under an interim head coach (one of the assistants who stayed on).
</li><li> 2012: Gus Malzahn, previously offensive coordinator at Auburn, comes in as the new head coach. A 93 regular season and another Sun Belt title follows... and Malzahn is hired by Auburn again, this time as head coach. A second assistant is named interim head coach, and this time they win their bowl game.
</li><li> 2013: Bryan Harsin, who had shared offensive coordinator duties at Texas, becomes head coach. They aren't quite as successful, going 75 in the regular season, but still share the Sun Belt title. Immediately after the season, Harsin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">is named head coach at Boise State</a>. The same assistant who had led ASU in its 2012 bowl game again serves as interim head coach, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">and the Red Wolves win again</a>.
</li><li> 2014: ASU hires Blake Anderson as head coach. In an attempt to stop the turnover, a hefty buyout clause is written into his contract. His initial salary was $700,000, and his buyout was $3 million in each of the first two years of the deal. It apparently worked, since Anderson is still in Jonesboro as of the upcoming 2020 season.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope in college sports even goes beyond players and coaches... conferences have experienced it from time to time, most notably the Western Athletic Conference. The WAC, founded in 1962 with 6 members, experienced relatively little turmoil for its first 20-plus years; while charter members Arizona and Arizona State left for what's now the Pac-12 in 1978, the league would soon stabilize with 9 members. Things were relatively calm until the mid-90s...
<ul><li> In 1992, the Southeastern Conference played its first football championship game, which became a <em>monster</em> cash cow for the league. Since NCAA rules at the time required that a conference have 12 members in order to play a championship game, other leagues began maneuvering toward that end. By this time, the WAC had 10 members, as Fresno State had joined a few months before the first SEC title game.
</li><li> Then in 1994, the Southwest Conference imploded, and the Big Eight Conference took in that league's four biggest-name schools to create the current Big 12 Conference, which would begin play in 1996. That was the chance the WAC was looking for, since four SWC schools were left out of the Big 12. They took in Rice, TCU, and SMU from the SWC, and didn't stop there, adding San Jose State and UNLV from the Big West Conference and Tulsa from the Missouri Valley Conference, bringing the league up to 16.
</li><li> However, the 16-team WAC was beset by internal and external issues from its outset, and within two years, most of the "classic" members were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">fed up with it all</a>. Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, Utah, and Wyoming agreed in 1998 to break away, recruiting fellow old-line members New Mexico and San Diego State plus "newcomer" UNLV to form the Mountain West Conference in 1999.
</li><li> 2000: Nevada (as in the Reno campus) joins.
</li><li> 2001: After the Big West dropped football, Boise State left that league to join the WAC. Louisiana Tech also joined at this time, while TCU left for Conference USA.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1vs0z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1vs0z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1vs0z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">TCU went from there to the Mountain West and eventually to the Big 12 (the last move came after it reneged on an announced move to the Big East).</span>
</li><li> 2005: When Conference USA got raided by the Big East, C-USA responded by luring Rice, SMU, Tulsa, and old-line member UTEP. The WAC responded by adding Idaho, New Mexico State, and Utah State. Things then settled down until the early-2010s realignment cycle, when this went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">into overdrive</a>:
</li><li> 2011: Boise State leaves for the Mountain West. Fresno State and Nevada also announce plans to leave for the MW at that time, but agree to stay on for an extra year in exchange for a reduced exit fee.
</li><li> 2012: The WAC brings in five new schools: football-playing Texas State and UTSA,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2eb6v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2eb6v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2eb6v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">TexasSan Antonio</span> plus non-football Denver, Seattle, and UT Arlington. At the same time, Fresno State and Nevada officially leave for the MW. The last old-line member, Hawaii, also leaves; noticing that the conference was expanding eastward, raising its already-high travel costs to utterly ridiculous levels, it decides to join MW football while parking its other sports in the Big West.
</li><li> 2013: No fewer than <em>seven</em> schools leave the WACDenver to the Summit League, LA Tech and UTSA to C-USA, San Jose State and Utah State to the MW, and Texas State and UT Arlington to the Sun Belt Conference. In advance of these defections, the WAC had announced it would no longer sponsor football after the 2012 season. In order to maintain its status as a D-I conference, it added men's soccer and brought in several new membersCal State Bakersfield, Chicago State, Grand Canyon (from Division II), TexasPan American, UMKC,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bzba');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bzba" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bzba');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">MissouriKansas City</span> and Utah Valley.
</li><li> 2014: Idaho leaves for the Big West, and things finally slow down again... although changes have continued to the present.
</li><li> 2015: While there were no membership changes per se, one member did change its institutional identity. TexasPan American was merged with TexasBrownsville to create TexasRio Grande Valley, or UTRGV. The UTPA athletic program moved directly to UTRGV.
</li><li> 2017: California Baptist joins from D-II.
</li><li> 2019: Another member changes its athletic identity, with UMKC rebranding its athletic program as Kansas City (although maintaining "UMKC" in educational contexts).
</li><li> 2020: Cal State Bakersfield will leave for the Big West, and Kansas City will return to its previous home of the Summit League. Dixie State and Tarleton State will join from D-II.
</li></ul></li><li> While professional sports doesn't have quite the extreme turnover rate of college sports, a team ravaged by injuries can experience it. The 201516 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">Memphis Grizzlies</a> took this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>:
<ul><li> Of the 12 players who saw action in the season's first game, only four played in the team's final game, the last of a four-game sweep by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs. Among the missing were stars Marc Gasol (who missed most of the season to a foot injury) and Mike Conley (who missed the last month of the season and the Spurs series to an Achilles injury).
</li><li> The Grizzlies were forced to use 28 players during the season, a record for a playoff team. NBA rosters are limited to a maximum of 15.
</li></ul></li><li> The pro-Soviet Communist parties in the West during the Cold War, especially the Communist Party of Great Britain. Because they were outspoken enemies of "the Establishment" and the inequalities and injustices of modern capitalist society, they tended to appeal to a young, radical, non-conformist demographic - who were then expected to become obedient drones and stick to "party discipline". Furthermore, a lot of those who didn't quit before the end of their university education would eventually rise to rank in the parties - but this was a problem, because most of the pro-Moscow parties took "Moscow gold" (i.e, financial assistance from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">KGB</a>) in order to stay afloat. Unfortunately, they told their young members to denounce this as a capitalist calumny to try and discredit them. When those members found out the truth, many left in disgust.
<ul><li> This problem was also present, although to a lesser degree, in the Trotskyist parties, due to the way many of them were set up: the system of democratic centralism is in theory designed to ensure internal debate but external unity. Many used a system whereby activists had to debate party policy in a narrow window between a couple of conferences, and then shut up after a course of action had been decided. This tended to lead to simmering ideological feuds that eventually boiled over outside conference time, leading to mass-resignations or splits.
</li></ul></li><li> Professional Sports Team rosters change somewhat from year to year, but the New York Knicks go through players like water.
</li><li> European football coaches, especially when the team is going through a crisis. Clubs facing relegation have managed to go through half a dozen coaches in one year.
</li><li> The academics have become this, with prospective scientists going from one underpaid temporary post-doc position to another for years, hoping they could somehow miraculously get tenured.
</li><li> The job of Australian Prime Minister has been compared numerous times to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> and it had truly earned it's reputation for this, a la Italy and Japan, although in this case it seems to be somewhat cyclic: between 2010 and 2018 (8 years), Australia has had 5 Prime Ministers, and one of them was PM twice. Between 1975 and 2007 (32 years), Australia had another 4 Prime Ministers. Between 1966 and 1975 (9 years), Australia had 5 Prime Ministers, although one of them was a caretaker PM after his predecessor disappeared. Between 1949 and 1966 (17 years), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">we had just one.</a> It's reached the point where paramedics no longer ask who the Prime Minister is as a way to check the mental state of a patient, because it's not inconceivable that even a completely alert person <em>might not know</em>.
</li><li> Command of the Army of the Potomac in the American Civil war changed frequently over the course of the four-year war: Irwin MacDowell, George MacClellan (who arguably counts twice as he was appointed and later dismissed on two separate occasions), Ambrose Burnside, Joseph Hooker, George Meade, John Parke (acting commander on four occasions when Meade was called away from his command). With the exception of Meade and Parke, all of them were dismissed by Lincoln for botching the command.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s presidential administration has done this enough to fill <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trump_administration_dismissals_and_resignations">an entire Wikipedia page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">Enough Said</a>.
</li><li> Since their 1999 reactivation in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a>, the Cleveland Browns have had <em><strong>31</strong></em> quarterbacks starting for them. By comparison, the New England Patriots have had only 5 QBs in that same timespan (Drew Bledsoe, Tom Brady, Matt Cassel, Jimmy Garapalo, and Jacoby Brisset). As of 2018, the Browns seem to have settled on Baker Mayfield.
</li><li> Any kind of business that chooses to use a multilevel marketing (MLM) business model. The model depends <em>entirely</em> on people getting others into their downline (rather than actually selling the product), but this gets harder and harder as more and more people join the MLM (as does trying to make a profit from the product itself). Many people who join MLM businesses quit (often after having lost money), and are replaced with new "consultants"/"distributors"/"representatives"/whatever the company calls them in short order. They are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi">Ponzi</a> schemes, even if they sell (or claim to sell) a product or service.
</li><li> Happened so often with cabinet-level positions in democratic French history that they came up with a term for it: "la valse des ministres" (the ministers' waltz).
