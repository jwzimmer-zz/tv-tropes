They may sack some villages, murder some people, perform some unconstitutional actions, and/or may be obtaining more emergency powers than necessary... But at least they have good intentions, like they said, right?
</p><p>Unfortunately, pretty much <strong>every</strong> extremist claims to have good intentions. This trope is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a> subversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>, who is sincere, but does horrible things in the name of whatever it is they fight for and by default will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">have a good point to make</a>. This villain, by contrast, only <em>claims</em> to be well-intentioned.
</p><p>A character who falls into this generally comes in one of three flavors:
</p><ul><li> They claim to have good intentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">as a mask to cover their real and self-serving motives</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">The good intentions might be seen as valid if the world surrounding them supported that viewpoint,</a> but they are instead using it as an excuse to try and do things that benefited them the most rather than the good intentions.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> They claim that their ends are good, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">maybe they do believe it</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">their ends are good only by their own warped standards</a>.
</li><li> They genuinely started with good intentions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">but lost them over time</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSideWillMakeYouForget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSideWillMakeYouForget">outright forgot</a> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">original motives</a>.
</li></ul><p>Notably, these characters have a tendency to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monsters</a>, likely because committing atrocities and <em>lying</em> about doing it for a good cause is considered way more evil than genuinely doing it for a good cause, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">more slimy</a> than doing those evil things anyway but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtLeastIAdmitIt">at least being up-front about your selfish motives</a>.

Curiously, over the series, Westcott showed to be even more sinister and cruel by unleashing all kind of disgusting and brutal crimes that humans can evoke upon the world.

To achieve his goals, Westcott caused mayhem and misery to all major races of the series: from Spirits, Quasi-Spirits, Wizards, Irregulars, Humans, Inverse Spirits and even Mages. At the end, Westcott is not a saint who is fighting to save his own race but just a selfish bastard who thinks only of himself.

He left his neighborhood under the watchful eye of two gangs he controlled while he joined Deathstroke's team to find Slipknot, the villain who killed his son. Mark's desire to avenge his son's death <em>might</em> have been sympathetic and well-meaning, except like Cinder above he joins in killing the totally innocent Ryan Choi to achieve his goal. And once Deathstroke finally gets his hands on Slipknot and Mark kills him, Mark doesn't feel any better about his son's death. Oh, and he returns to Liberty Hill to discover the residents all live in fear of their lives thanks to Mark abdicating responsibility to his thugs. Mark's inability to think things out in the long term and do whatever's necessary just robs his actions of credibility and makes him an incompetent asshole.

He finally unveils his true colors as a coward and a hypocrite to everybody when he recklessly orders a nuclear strike on the Giant, forgetting that the latter is still in town and everybody, including himself, will be caught in the blast radius. Once he fully comprehends that this will mean <em>his</em> death, he renounces his patriotism and tries to flee for his life.

But if your persuasion skills are good enough you can get him to admit that he did it out of petty jealousy: ironically, his body rejects all but the simplest augmentations, so he has come to resent other people because they can use his inventions while he cannot and is taking out his jealousy on everyone else.

The show demonstrates Demona is simply an utterly vengeful, bitter woman lashing out from centuries of isolation and denial, and she's more concerned with having a scapegoat for her sins so she can keep being the victim.
<ul><li> Demona's spent centuries clinging to the belief both her clans were destroyed because of humans and thinks she's reclaiming the Earth for gargoyles by trying to kill every human on the planet. While it's true gargoyles have suffered a lot thinks to human intolerance, they've suffered just as much thanks to Demona's backstabbing. Her original clan was destroyed because she helped betray Wyvern Castle to the viking invaders, and her second clan was destroyed because she allied with Canmore thinking Macbeth was gonna betray her first. Both times happened because Demona automatically assumed the worst and acted without any perspective, but she still insists she did nothing wrong.
</li><li> When the trickster Puck deliberately misconstrues Demona's genocidal wish to be rid of humans by turning all humans into gargoyles, instead of being thrilled her kind's now finally the dominant species she's disgusted humans have been granted the gift of being a gargoyle. Demona simply cannot let go of wanting humans to die even when she's finally gained the world she proclaims she's been fighting for.

Growing an intense hatred of all men, she assembled a chemical bomb that was designed to kill all of them, creating what she would see as a utopia. She ignores men like Superman actively rescuing people, or that she's aligned with women who as violent as the men she despises. Hippolyta leaves Themyscira and, to Fury's surprise, objects to her plan for worldwide murder. Even learning that the captain of the ship she was on, a man, saved her life, does not change her mind. Even ignoring a planet of one gender would likely die out, it's clear she's only taking the revenge she desires on those who destroyed her birth home on all men, ignoring the harm she'd do the world.
</li><li> Starlight Glimmer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>.

Ostensibly, Starlight does this because she believes true friendship can only come through perfect equality, which in turn is only possible when everyone is equally (in)competent. But she retains her own considerable talent for magic, suggesting that she's really more interested in power than in equality. When called out on this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrisy</a>, Starlight claims that it was necessary, because her own magic is needed to equalize everyone else.

Because of that, she blamed Cutie Marks for what happened between her and Sunburst and became a cult leader just to ensure that any other friends she made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain">would never be taken away by their Cutie Marks and leave her behind again</a>.
