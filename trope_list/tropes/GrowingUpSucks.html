Riding bikes down by the creek, catching polliwogs in a jar, camping out under the stars? Well, you're wrong! Some days, I sit there in my office, looking out at you kids on the playground and I think, 'They don't know how good they got it. In a few years, they're all going to be grownups like me and all those good times will just be memories for them, too.' So go ahead. Put a whoopie-cushion in my chair. Cover my carpet with fake vomit. Make fun of my big, saggy butt. But don't you ever say I don't care about summer vacation, 'cause those memories are the last part of childhood I got left."</em>

Not only will this be implied throughout the show's narrative, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> themselves will probably be all too aware of this fact, and refer to it openly, with varying degrees of acceptance or dread.
</p><p>In addition, this will probably feature as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot">plot</a> point. The concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge">"childhood's end"</a> will probably be clearly illustrated, with the now-grown up character losing something that was fundamental to their happiness as a child. On shows based mainly in reality, this will probably take the form of the protagonist's group of friends going their separate ways after graduation. The child may lose his guardians, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a>, or even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAndPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAndPowers">powers</a>, if these all come with a time limit or are directly linked to his status as a child. For example, children are assumed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyCurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstantlyCurious">wide-eyed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuriousAsAMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuriousAsAMonkey">curious</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">innocent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust">trusting</a>; adults are usually portrayed as pragmatic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">cynical</a> and set in their ways.

</p><p>In some works, this is invoked as the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>; they have forgotten how hellish being a child can be, and blithely ignore all the attempts by the child to tell them, because they have convinced themselves that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestYearsOfYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestYearsOfYourLife">it was better then</a>.

</p><p>Happens <em>a great deal</em> in the real world when someone leaves adolescence and their teen-age years behind and realizes that while childhood is not always a picnic, things are different when mom and dad aren't paying their bills anymore: they have to find a place to live, buy health insurance, work at a job they may not like in order to have money in the bank, and otherwise deal with all the things that made their parents so uncool and boring. One of the first steps into being a full-fledged adult is realizing all the sacrifices your parents had to make and the insane hoops they had to jump through to keep a roof over your head and food on the table...

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Gohan is one of the most powerful characters when his "hidden power" is unlocked. Later in the Buu Saga he is terrible at first and cannot beat Buu even after his "special training". Vegeta lampshades this by claiming "he was stronger when he was a kid". Though that was mainly because before that point, he neglected training in favor of studying for college.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Ed becomes furious when he finds out that Mustang did not inform him about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hughes' death</span>. Aunt Pinako tells him that he's acting like a child for complaining about it and thinking that Mustang kept Ed in the dark out of spite.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraWarsTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraWarsTV">anime</a>, Sakura is reminded that as she grows up, her "spirit power" will fade and she will have to pass her beloved and long-fought-for sword to the next generation. The said reduction in "spirit power" is later the cause of Sumire's retirement, as well as Ratchet's withdrawal from field duty in the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove">Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love</a></em>. Though the second OVA (written before Tomizawa Michie's temporary retirement from the franchise) implied it could be 10 or more years for Sakura, and she would be too old to marry at that point... so it's not exactly tied with childhood. In fact, it seems to be more about using up your powers (as Ratchet already had a long history of service on three continents and Sumire was the first member of the team to ever pilot a suit of spirit armor).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> does this consistently, starting with the cast's entry into high school and ending with their graduation, when the girls set off for different colleges. It's more optimistic than other examples though — Chiyo-chan notes "Even though we've graduated... we're still together. All of us."
</li><li> Older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a></em> series seemed to imply that their adventures and fantastic powers were simply metaphors to give them the strength to become... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">normal Japanese women and wives, who naturally shouldn't have powers greater than their husbands</a> so they give them up. This seems to have created enormous cognitive dissonance, and some recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> avoid this angle. This <em>would</em>, however, help explain some of the more questionable bits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>... Notably inverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Nanoha</a> who, instead of giving up her powers and becoming a normal person, leaves the planet to become a legend. By the time of <em>Force</em> they had to take "Girl" out of the title since by that point she's a 25 year old mother (via adoption) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">and still on the front lines</a>. The fact that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has a relationship with an equally-powered <em>woman</em></span> might be of influence.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> games and animes have tried to put this Aesop into the mix, in a manner that's somewhat painful. The original series goes into detail how the AIs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">people too</a> but then adds that previous protagonists have "grown past The World" and have essentially abandoned them to later genocide. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow">Hey, they had to go to college</a>.
</li><li> Simon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> could undergo an example of this, even though he obviously gets adjusted to the ever-changing world around and the changes within himself. Name ONE instance where someone isn't affected even a <em>little</em> bit <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the death of a mentor!</span>
</li><li> According to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> the reward for a young woman "growing out of" the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a>, a relationship built on years of trust and communication, is that she has become mature enough to be with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Pervert</a> that she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">little in common with</a>.
<ul><li> A striking example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba">Mahoraba</a></em>, where Tamami loses her battle for the affections of Kozue to Shiratori. Sure, Shiratori is not really a pervert, but still...
</li></ul></li><li> Kurau in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KurauPhantomMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KurauPhantomMemory">Kurau Phantom Memory</a></em> spent most of her youth being taken over by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Rynax entity</a>. After the disappearance of her Rynax, the human Kurau is faced with leading a more sedate life as a grown-up. She doesn't mind that much, but her fond memories of her Rynax-filled past still give it all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">melancholic slant</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Simoun">Simoun</a></em> all inhabitants of the planet Daikuuriku are born female and have to choose their gender when they're 17 years old by going to the "Spring". Since there is a war raging, the priestesses who pilot the Simoun aircraft are exempt from this, since once they have visited the Spring they will lose their ability to fly. Some of the characters take this as an opportunity to stay a "maiden" as long as possible, but in the end everybody has to undergo the transformation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A few manage to escape it though: Limone and Dominura end up in the past, Yun became the new high priestess and Aer and Neviril <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a></span>.
</li><li> A fairly common Fan interpretation of the first four (especially the first two) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> is that the chosen children must have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">degree of innocence</a>, but that they cannot get through the series without losing it.
<ul><li> In fact, this is pretty overt in the second series - the older children at first drift away from their lives in the Digiworld because they're too busy with things like bands and school that they deem to be more important. In fact, rather heartbreakingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villain Oikawa is motivated almost entirely by his all-consuming desire to enter the Digiworld and have Digimon himself - presented as an attempt to become a child again, or at least reclaim the feeling he had when playing with his friend as a kid.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on the other hand the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> presents all the Chosen Children, now adults with children of their own but still maintaining their Digimon companions and visiting the Digiworld, and at least the Spanish dub suggests that ALL humans have Digimon companions, no matter age.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureLastEvolutionKizuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureLastEvolutionKizuna">Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna</a></em> shows this to be a quite a literal example; it confirms that those chosen to become DigiDestined have to be children in order for Digivices to function. Once they reach adulthood, that power ends up fading and the partnership between them and the Digimon will ultimately have to end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used somewhat in an episode. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Ikuto</a> breaks an X-Egg (a negative Heart's Egg), he goes on to say he doesn't feel bad about breaking Heart's Eggs and children's dreams because, as they grow older, children begin to think more realistically about their dreams and deem them impossible to succeed, ultimately giving up their dreams and losing their Heart's Egg (which is the place all people's dreams, wishes, and their 'would-be-selves' are located) and growing up to be dull, dreary, and tired faced adults who are living unhappy and unfulfilling lives.
</li><li> And another example of this series that is hinted at, but not explicitly stated: once a child whose Heart's Egg has given birth to a guardian character grows into an adult who will be able to reach their dreams, their guardian character will go back inside their Heart's Egg to slumber because now the child has the ability and encouragement to become who they want to be on their own. While not 100% negative, it is sad to see a guardian character, who most kids become very close to and grow to love, say goodbye.
</li><li> Not just hinted - a later story arc has Amu face this prospect after meeting Nikaidou's chara again. When asked if she doesn't want to grow up, she states that she doesn't really know.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://myotakuhalf.wordpress.com/2009/02/04/bleach-new-ed-sky-chord-by-tsuji-shion/">The full version of the song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> included in <em>Bleach</em>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZzO8vbITo">Ending 18<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> seems to indicate that growing up can be difficult and isn't the most important thing, but it has to be done.
</li><li> In the filler arc, Momo Hinamori inverts this. She looks forward the day she grows up, because that's when she could stop being naive and prevents herself from getting crushed in case someone dear to her betrays her.
</li><li> A review, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACq7tgjHdGA">The Fall of Bleach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, brought up an interesting point that the series (least up to the end of the Soul Society arc) is a metaphor of this as Ichigo and his friends fights against the rather odd rules of Soul Society in the way a teenager enters into adulthood and experience things foreign to them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> plays with this trope. Shortly after Naruto returns to Konoha in Part II, when Konohamaru shows him his perverted ninjutsu, he tells him that he's not a kid anymore and that he shouldn't use jutsu like that. Sakura is impressed, but also a little sad that Naruto is not the same person he was before... until Naruto then suggests that he's developed more effective perverted ninjutsu. While Naruto and many of his friends (especially Shikamaru) appear to be growing up in Part II, Naruto is personally determined not to grow up in a way that requires abandoning his ideals, like his commitment to bring Sasuke back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Coming-of-Age Story</a> where "growing up" apparently includes enduring terrible pain, sacrificing yourself for your best friend, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">erased from existence</a></span>. However, the series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">very open-ended</a>, and often interpreted as a subversion or inversion where much of the conflict comes from <em>refusal</em> to grow up and face your emotional problem or attempting to grow up in ways that are actually very immature (mostly on the assumption of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsARiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsARiteOfPassage">Sex as a Rite-of-Passage</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Utena experience also may have let her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>, while Anthy abandoning her abusive brother and Ohtori Academy to "grow up" and follow Utena is a definite step up.</span>
</li><li> Generally the entire third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> is about this, at least in the original version: most of the bad characters initially tell Judai that he can't win because he doesn't have the "darkness in his heart" associated with growing up and facing pain and loss. Judai goes on to win anyway, but when his games result in the loss of friends, he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and becomes the Supreme King, and he's never quite the same. Some of these character arcs are retained in season 4, where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> Judai shies away from his friends, but is eventually forced to battle again when his friends' memories and, eventually, entire existences are erased. We then get it hammered home in his final duel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with Yugi, where he remembers to always have fun dueling no matter how old you get</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyAndClover">Honey and Clover</a></em>, the main characters go through a lot of spiritual growing pains throughout their late adolescence and early adulthood, having to make tough decisions along the way. Most of them appear to wind up rather well, but the main character is left with bittersweet feelings about having to let go of the last remains of his youth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em>:
<ul><li> After the girls start watching part of the new version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Lovely Chocolat</a>, their old favorite TV show, Sae notes that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater">still watching it</a> even though they're in high school (and are therefore supposed to be out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">Fleeting Demographic</a>). Upon hearing this, Hiro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveHair">hair</a> falls flat, and she laments about how growing up is no fun.
</li><li> This trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in the episode <em>Hiro</em> in the fourth season, when Hiro practically fell into a bout of depression because of this. Particularly, she found herself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not wanting to graduate</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The girls from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> are at their magical peak between 12-18 years old. At around 20, they no longer have the necessary power to put up an effective shield and are usually forced to retire lest they become a liability in battle. Needless to say that this causes some characters quite a bit of distress.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LitchiHikariClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LitchiHikariClub">Litchi Hikari Club</a></em> is a very dark example of this trope. The club's disgust for the ugliness of humans goes to the point of resulting in their murdering a teacher (although in Zera's words, "We are not rejecting growth. What we reject is the fact that you haven't died.") But it gets worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jaibo sabotages the club and eventually sets into motion the events that result in their destruction because he is afraid that since he is showing signs of becoming an adult, his voice breaking and his beard beginning to grow, Zera will no longer love him. It makes Jaibo a very crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Bishounen</a> and it may for the best that he never lives to grow up.</span>
</li><li> This trope is a driving force in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> and Soubi overtly mentions it more than once when he claims that he dislikes anyone older than twenty. Ritsuka too often comments that adults are evil or at least uncaring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> is full of this. Friendships changing, people changing, new feelings occuring, puberty, the whole deal. The main problem is that the two protagonists are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> and puberty is typically a horrid time when you're trans (many have described it as essentially being a living nightmare).
</li><li> A recurring theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s films:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em>, where Satsuki and Mei lose contact with the eponymous forest spirit after their adventure. The credits imply (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms) that Totoro and his friends kept watch over the girls as they grew up, but never showed themselves again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em>, where Kiki loses her ability hold a conversation with her cat familiar Jiji. She initially takes it as part of the larger problem of losing her magic, but when she regains it she finds that she still can't speak to him. The loss is thus implied to be simply a part of growing up. (The Disney translation decided that was too depressing and added a line of spoken dialogue to avert this trope.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway">Spirited Away</a></em>, where Chihiro's memories of interacting with the river spirit Kohaku were suppressed as she grew out of infancy. The movie also heavily implies that her whole adventure in the spirit world begins fading from her memory as soon as she leaves it.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NurseAngelRirikaSOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NurseAngelRirikaSOS">Nurse Angel Ririka SOS</a></em> begins, Ririka's life is great. Her family and friends are all wonderful and she lacks for nothing. Then she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior">Magical Girl Warrior</a>, and the contrast between her civilian life and duties of her secret life get steadily wider... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until finally she has to make the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">ultimate sacrifice</a>.</span>
</li><li> The point of the "Afterlife" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> is to avert the harsher examples of this. Everyone there had their child or teen years cut short by some tragic event (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yui</span> was crippled, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Otonashi</span> had to spent most of his time caring for a dying sister and was unable to accomplish anything of meaning with his life, etc.) and thus was sent there to be able to live out what they originally could not. Upon completion of that will, they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">pass on</a> into a new life.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost everyone with special powers loses them when they become adults.</span> Subverted a bit in that none of them really care.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShounenNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShounenNote">Shounen Note</a></em> is about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">prodigious</a> boy soprano at the cusp of puberty. Yutaka's voice will soon start cracking and he'll loose his soprano abilities. He notes he can still sing but Vladimir (who is also a boy soprano) notes it won't be the same as it was when he was a soprano.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoodnightPunpun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoodnightPunpun">Goodnight Punpun</a></em> has a <em>very</em> dark take on this. It treats growing up as a process of disillusionment for many of the characters, where they lose sight of their dreams, realize ugly truths about themselves, and suffer from personal loss and doubt. This is especially noticeable with the protagonist, who gradually loses his innocence due to the abuse, indifference, callousness and pettiness he experiences growing up and becomes a much worse person as a result.
</li><li> Mentioned in the short oneshot manga <em>Cotton Candy Love</em>. The protagonist says to a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans girl</a> that she is prepubescent now but one day her androgyny will dwindle. When asked whether she still wants to live as a girl she says "yes".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em> is full of middle schoolers feeling pubescent angst. The fact the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">crossdresser</a> characters are masculinizing is mentioned several times. It's in fact the reason why Satoshi stopped wearing the girls uniform to school <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though Tamura eventually convinces him that even if he doesn't pass perfectly he can still look pretty</span>. Marika is a transgender girl and looming puberty is a worry of hers. She isn't on any hormone blockers or hormone treatment apparently and her classmates talk about her behind her back. Hachi was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneOfTheBoys">One of the Boys</a> growing up but when she hit puberty earlier than her peers suddenly her male friends were adverse to her. Marika's friend Akane feels stressed because she has no interest in boys <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until she falls for Tamura</span> and dislikes the start of her menstruation cycle.
</li><li> Ren from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanamiCherry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanamiCherry">Sazanami Cherry</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdresser</a> with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity">Ambiguous Gender Identity</a>. He doesn't like the fact that puberty will hamper his androgynous, girly looks and change his voice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> plays with this. Naota <em>wants</em> to act like a grown up as he sees adults as immature for him. Though eventually comes to learn that the reason they do is because most miss their childhood and it's a way to keep that spirit of excitement alive through the bevy of responsibility they now have (jobs, families, dealing with relationship issues, running organization, etc). Naota dealing with many of these at his age constantly overwhelms him despite trying to be more mature then he really is. Ultimately the series main aseop is that there's no reason you can't grow up to be an adult and not have fun in the process. Trying to be more mature then you are when you're younger will only rob you of that experience.
<ul><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCLProgressiveAndAlternative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCLProgressiveAndAlternative">third season counterpart</a> Kana has a very contrasting mindset, but it spells out this trope all the same. Her defiance to accept her growing adulthood tends to hurt the people around her, to the point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pets breaks ties with her before the finale</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> 10-year old Nate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> is a boy who can interact with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> using his Yo-Kai Watch. As he grew up he found he lost this ability. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchShadowsideTheReturnOfTheOniKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchShadowsideTheReturnOfTheOniKing">Yo-kai Watch: Shadowside - The Return of the Oni King</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">Nate's 13-year old daughter</a> Natsume and two of her peers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangingOfTheGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangingOfTheGuard">are the new owners of their own Yo-Kai Watches</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime, this is cited to be one of the in-universe reasons why certain Pokémon, particularly Dawn's Piplup and Snowy (Lillie's Vulpix), refuse to evolve (the other being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>). In Piplup's case, he'd rather remain in his base stage permanently to preserve his memories of meeting Dawn.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> OVA series, this is why Washu has an young body: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having already grown up, gotten married and had a child, she lost both her husband and child to said husband's social status. She was so heartbroken by the act that she willingly used her super-science to change her body back into that of a twelve year old so she wouldn't be hurt again.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamagotchiTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamagotchiTheMovie">Tamagotchi: The Movie</a></em>, Tanpopo the human girl is nervous because she is going to have a baby sibling, and thus there are new responsibilities her parents expect from her. Her adventure with the Tamagotchis after being transported to their planet by accident helps her get over this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights">Lapis Re:LiGHTs</a></em> has Angelica of Sadistic☆Candy. Formerly known as "Ange", she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch">The Baby of the Bunch</a> of her old group, Ray, one of the best, most popular, and powerful witches in the world. Her main appeal was her "cute, pure, innocence" which she happily played up with a ruffled, fluffy, childish design for her stage outfit, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">Catchphrase</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a> specifically made to sound cute, and just generally acting like an adorable child. Then a horrific incident occurs, she finds herself emotionally unprepared to deal with it and freezes up, and later the group disbands for yet unknown reasons. Before the series proper, she goes through a <em>very</em> delayed puberty, drops the name Ange and claims she's an entirely different person as Angelica, and is now known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolGirl">Huge School Girl</a> trying and failing to be "normal". This might be best demonstrated by her accidentally using her old catchphrase and people both assuming she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhraseCatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhraseCatcher">Phrase Catcher</a> and chiding her for using it as she's not <em>nearly</em> as cute and tiny as Ange was.

</li><li> One of the most popular strips in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits">Zits</a> has Jeremy's mom grabbing him, unzip his body to reveal his six-year-old self. Then they spend several panels doing whatever activities a six-year-old would do with his mother (but a teen wouldn't be caught dead doing) before going back in his body and zipping it back up. It's an unusual example in that the trope is being applied to the mom <em>about</em> the kid— Jeremy has so far shown no nostalgia for his childhood.

<ul><li> A little deeper than that. "Should you need us..." Growing up does not mean you abandon the fantasy things you love, but just realizing they are fantasy and you can't let it get in the way of what's important.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Disney Channel Original Movie, <em>Don't Look Under the Bed</em>, showed abandoned imaginary friends turning into boogey men. Boogey men with mouths full of fangs and long, yellowed fingernails that dragged children under the bed and trapped them in the underworld. So... yeah.
<ul><li> However it's stated that usually when kids grow up imaginary friends find new kids to be friends with, only when they're abandoned before they're ready do they turn into boogey men. Making it "trying to grow up <em>too fast</em> sucks".

</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em>, an unofficial sequel to <em>Peter Pan</em>, zigzags the trope by showing exactly why, while Growing Up Sucks, it's a necessary part of life. Instead of whisking Wendy's granddaughter away to Neverland, Peter instead chooses to stay in the real world with her, and finally grows up, forgetting his adventures in Neverland and becoming a rather boring lawyer with a family of his own (married to Wendy's granddaughter, natch). He then returns to Neverland to rescue his children from Captain Hook, and has a grand time reliving his childhood adventures, but eventually realizes that he can't get this life back, and his children need him to be a responsible adult. On the other hand, he also comes to a realization that being a stuffy adult is not actually being "responsible", and that he still needs to retain some childlike enjoyment of life (as symbolized by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheElectronicLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheElectronicLeash">trashing his cell phone</a>).
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ted">Ted</a></em> averts this trope by having both the title character, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToys">living teddy bear</a> and his thirty-something human both finding that they are both better finally maturing with their own lives to a reasonable degree.

The expulsion from Eden in the book of Genesis is a Growing Up Sucks story, as Adam and Chava/Eve take on new knowledge and freedom, but lose the childlike state of being eternally babysat.

Given that the daemon is an anima/animus of the child, however, this development is directly linked to their bonded human rather than the daemon. Most likely a metaphor for "becoming set in your ways", the lack of prejudice and adaptability children are supposed to have being sacrificed for the reassurance of a firm identity - and this is treated as a joyous occasion by the two main characters. If anything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> subverts.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>: Children eventually outgrow permission to visit Narnia, because, according to Aslan, the point of meeting him in Narnia is so they may grow to know him by "his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">real name</a>" on Earth.

<ul><li> Maybe, as Susan wasn't a 'friend' of Narnia anymore because of the infamous 'lipstick and nylons' quote. Two schools of thought exist, one that CS Lewis wanted to punish her for entering sexual maturity and preferring that to Narnia. The offical one was she became shallow, vain and attached to material things. Of course C.S. Lewis himself said that Susan might well get back to Narnia someday; 'In her own time, and in her own way.'
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> subversion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> comments that the desire to be "grown up" is itself a mark of childhood:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">put away childish things</a>, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> is the proverbial boy who refused to grow up. His Lost Boys remain young and immortal as long as they're with him. (And as long as they can keep from regaining any memories of their former lives in the real world.) At the end of the story, Wendy returns to the real world, grows up and has a family. When Peter Pan comes calling again, he informs her that she is too old to go back to Neverland and whisks her daughter away instead.
<ul><li> Note that <em>Peter Pan</em> plays with the idea that, while growing up sucks, not growing up <em>also</em> sucks (your friends leave you, and eventually die; you have perpetual forgetfulness and no family). It's hinted, when the Lost Boys leave, that they would have left at some point anyway; to quote the opening sentence, "All children, except one, grow up." In other words, while Peter urges everyone to stay with him and forbids growing old, <em>no one but himself</em> is capable of permanently resisting age—and, if you look at it another way, everyone but himself is capable of growing up.
</li><li> The original version of the story (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPanInKensingtonGardens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPanInKensingtonGardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></em>) has Peter run off while still a baby and get "raised" by birds (not of course growing up), and then meeting the fairies of Kensington Gardens, often joining them for playtime after the park has closed. He pleases the fairy queen so much that she grants him a wish, which he bargains down to two smaller wishes. He uses the first to visit his sleeping mother, flying in through the window she always leaves open for him. She looks so sad that he almost wakes her, but then decides to go back to the gardens to tie up some loose ends. But then he takes so long saying goodbye to all his friends (possibly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">Year Outside, Hour Inside</a> effect often attributed to fairy realms) that when he uses his second wish to fly back to his mother, he finds the window closed and barred, and his mother sleeps with her arms around a new little boy. "In vain he beat his little hands against the panes. He had to fly back, weeping, to the Gardens...." Thus he grew up (got a heart-rending lesson in the consequences for immature behavior) and, as a consequence, was never able to grow up. The last two lines set the tone:
<div class="indent">"It is Lock-Out Time. The iron bars are up for life."
</div></li></ul></li><li> Gender-specific Growing Up Sucks - almost every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PonyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PonyTale">Pony Tale</a> in existence had at least one female character who "grew out" of her love for horses - usually, gender bias is in operation and only the male characters actually make a career out of equestrian sports, while for the girls, their pony is just a "child substitute" they'll get rid of once they discover boys.
<ul><li> K.M Peyton was one writer who did this to death, with the heroines giving up horses to become wives and mothers. Generally, the horse is seen as a substitute for a boyfriend. The Pennington/Fly-by-Night series is pretty blunt about it as well - one character reflects that she preferred horses who were wild and unpredictable, and that's how she likes her men. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Thanks for that image, Ms. Peyton</a>.
</li><li> A specific example of this is "Jill", a series of pony books written in the 1950s and definitely a product of its time. She's portrayed as a highly capable, intelligent girl with a gift for dealing with horses. Once she leaves school, though, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors">mentor</a> Captain Cholly-Sawcutt (yes, that is his real name, honest) sternly informs her that she's too old to be playing with horses all the time, and as a girl she'll never make it in the competitive field. To which Jill replies that he's absolutely right, and she'll get stuck in at her typing classes so she can be a "top notch" secretary, the only proper job for a woman. Sigh.
</li><li> A rather melancholy entry in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdrianMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdrianMole">Adrian Mole</a></em> diaries has Adrian pass by the field where his on-again, off-again (very much off at that point) girlfriend Pandora used to ride a pony she now scarcely visits. The implication is not just that Pandora has left behind her pony Blossom, but also her adolescent first love Adrian.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> here, as plenty of girls do give up (or are forced to give up) horses for boys, college, or marriage and a family of their own. Many of them return to the sport later if their time and resources allow it. Some wind up moving to a city and cannot keep horses any more, but go back to riding in midlife. (Plus some larger cities have places — usually parks — where you can keep horses and ride. Grant Park in Chicago and Central Park in New York are famous for this.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> book series, everyone in the world is born with the ability to communicate telepathically with animals and to remember the strange spiritual journey which led them to their moment of birth. People lose this ability and forget everything that happens to them in their early infancy once they begin talking. (Mary Poppins has somehow managed to retain both her early memories and abilities, which is how she communicates with both animals <em>and</em> with the younger, pre-toddler-age Banks children.) It's always vaguely implied (and definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a>) that while the Banks family and the world they live in is human, Mary herself is supernatural. A popular theory is that she's a fairy of some sort, temporarily exiled from her usual world (which is why she comes and goes from the Banks' lives like she does). It would certainly explain a lot about her, if it's true.
</li><li> Joyfully subverted in <em>Good Night Opus</em> where the story ends with Opus returned home after his fantasy journey and telling about it to his Granny. Thus informed, Granny finds a Pegasus coming to her bedroom to take her on her own trip.
</li><li> Double subversion: "Robbie", a science fiction short story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, has young Gloria, who gets a robot nursemaid named Robbie. When publicly available robots were the newest craze, her mother basked in the prestige of owning Robbie. However, anti-robot sentiment quickly rises throughout the world and suddenly Mrs. Weston becomes concerned about the effect a robot nursemaid would have on her daughter, since Gloria is more interested in playing with Robbie than with the other children. She eventually badgers her husband into returning Robbie to the factory. Gloria refuses to forget about Robbie, constantly badgering her parents about him. Finally, one day during a tour of the factory, Robbie saves her life. Her mother gives in at that point and agrees that Robbie can stay "until he rusts". It is a double subversion because the story mentions that many years later Gloria had to give up Robbie as privately owned robots were outlawed on Earth, but by then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">she was grown up and was supposedly not as attached to him</a>.
</li><li> This is often added as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> coda to adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> and such.
<ul><li> Although at the end of <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, the story turns to Alice's older sister who thinks fondly about her younger sibling and how she'll grow up one day and even though she won't have fantastical dreams anymore, she'll be able to give other children fantastical dreams and "make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale". It's not so much Growing Up Sucks as Growing Up Is Inevitable But It Doesn't Have To Suck If You Don't Want It To.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> gave this as the reason for killing off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hedwig</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>.
</li><li> Piemur, a boy soprano in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> series, finds that growing up sucks for fundamentally biological reasons — his voice breaks and he loses his central position in the Harper Hall choir, and is transferred into the drum tower (basically the communications centre for the then-technology scarce Pern) until the Master Harper, Robinton, can decide on his future. While Piemur <em>does</em> remain critical to Harper Hall operations, it's mainly in his later role as an adventurer/spy, rather than as part of the sheltered, music-centred life he'd enjoyed until then.
</li><li> In <em>A Coming of Age</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>, people are born with powerful telekinetic powers, and lose them at puberty. Adults keep them in line by controlling all technology and knowledge (even reading), but kids can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IBelieveICanFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IBelieveICanFly">fly under their own power</a>, so it's clear who has the better end of the deal.
</li><li> At first this is thought to be played straight in <em>The Thief Lord</em> by Cornelia Funke, where two of the main characters desire to become adults so they can have more "power" (in society) and two of the "villains" want to become children because they didn't have a happy childhood. But this suffers a radical subversion at the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when one of the children becomes an adult and lives happily (even having some years of his life skipped) while the adults who become children found childhood "boring"</span>.
</li><li> Partially (and grimly) subverted in Günter Grass's novel <em>The Tin Drum</em>. Three-year-old Oskar deliberately stunts his growth, by hurling himself down the stairs, in an attempt to avoid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">horrors of the adult world</a>. He also uses his titular toy drum to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadphonesEqualIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadphonesEqualIsolation">shield himself from these horrors</a>. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a blow to the head causes him to age instantly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">becoming horribly malformed</a></span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking">Pippi Longstocking</a> doesn't want to grow up, and eats "krumelur" pills to remain a child. Whether or not it works is never revealed.
</li><li> Pretty much the main theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT">IT</a></em>, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>.
</li><li> A staple of William Wordsworth's poetry and philosophy, especially "Ode: Intimations of Immortality From Recollections of Early Childhood." He takes Plato's idea that the soul pre-exists the body and says that at our birth we know and understand everything, but we forget it all as we grow older, which results in losing our sense of wonder at the beauty of the world. Sounds depressing, but actually the way Wordsworth presents it is pretty hopeful, since he believes that it <em>is</em> possible to retain childlike innocence and wonder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye">The Catcher in the Rye</a></em> is another classic example. The title refers to the main character's urge to keep kids, especially his little sister, from growing up and losing their innocence. He mishears the words to "Coming through the Rye" by Robert Burns and imagines himself standing by a cliff at the edge of a field of rye where children are playing, and if any of them get too close to the cliff, he catches them. Of course in the end he realizes that you can't protect kids forever — but he must not have handled it well, since he's narrating the story from inside a mental institution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittlePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittlePrince">The Little Prince</a></em> is filled with examples of this trope. One of them is the phrase : "All grown-ups have been children, but very few remember."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook">The Graveyard Book</a></em>, Nobody Owens <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">loses his powers after he has grown-up and fulfilled the prophecy.</span>
<ul><li> But it's made clear that adulthood is when he gets to explore the world and find a real identity for himself. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> here is more 'growing up is difficult but necessary, now get on with it'.
</li></ul></li><li> Definitely a theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThiefOfAlways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThiefOfAlways">The Thief of Always</a></em>. At one point Harvey wishes for a miniature Noah's ark, a relic from his childhood, and House promptly gives him an exact, flawless copy. However due to his curiosity he ends up losing it in the lake. He does manage to save a few figurines <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (or rather, Lulu salvages them for him)</span> from the lake, but as soon as he leaves Hood House they disintegrate. Considering that Hood House is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> and the lake <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is where the transformed children are kept after Hood takes their souls</span>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic">What Do You Mean, It's Not Symbolic?</a> indeed.
</li><li> Zilpha Keatley Snyder's books almost universally end up with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding">Esoteric Happy Ending</a> thanks to her use of this trope. The children in her books, live dull, dreary lives, until encountering some unusual place, friend, or ability — which they lose at the end of the story, accompanied by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">Tragic Keepsake</a> and Anvilicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops">Stock Aesops</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Season of Ponies</em>, her first book, has Pamela losing almost everything at the end, but her beloved father comes back, and she's retained a vague ability to project a mental song that breaks mental barriers against freedom.
</li><li> <em>Black and Blue Magic</em> ends with Harry running out of the magic ointment that enabled him to grow wings and fly around at night; he keeps a feather.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em>The Changeling</em>, when Ivy declares that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreSpecial">all babies are born with magic</a> but lose it" as they get older. Martha ends up with a whole tackle box full of her and Ivy's tragic keepsakes after they part over false accusations and misunderstanding, but not before they invent a spell to prevent growing up: <em>Know all the questions but not the answers; Look for the different instead of the same; Never walk where there's room for running; Don't do anything that can't be a game.</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03k8x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03k8x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03k8x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fans of Snyder often cite this as having inspired them in their adult (but not "grown-up") lives, and it's cited on numerous blogs.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenSkyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenSkyTrilogy">Green-Sky Trilogy</a> (which became the video game <em>Below The Root</em>). Green-sky is populated by descendants of an earth colony, and babies are born with psychic powers they're supposed to <em>keep</em> and improve on as they mature. Here, the entire society was originally designed so that growing up would <em>not</em> suck. The fact that successive generations are losing these abilities at earlier ages is one of the first ominous signs that something is really wrong.

And once you do grow up, all you do is get old.
</li><li> Somewhat averted in Neil Gaiman's short story "Chivalry" where the reader realizes that if you look carefully you can still see the wonder of your childhood through a patina of dust.
</li><li> A major theme throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing">The Pale King</a></em>, but especially prevalent in Chris Fogle's chapter.
</li><li> Prominent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a>' 1911 story <em>The Door In the Wall</em>, where the narrator's childhood friend, now a stuffy lawyer, laments over the green door to Eden that he cannot enter now that he's grown up, and as it appears less and less frequently, all the regret over not making the decision to enter the door leads him to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commit suicide by walking into a deep construction dig.</span>

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs">Dinosaurs</a></em> featured Robbie challenging his father for dominance. He discovered that adulthood came with a whole bunch of hassles, and his father agreed growing up wasn't worth it. The only thing that Earl considered worthwhile enough about adulthood to reclaim his mantle and responsibilities? Sex.
</li><li> One of the recurring minor themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Undeclared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Undeclared">Undeclared</a></em> episode "Jobs, Jobs, Jobs", Steven and his dad are talking.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> has a version of this, when Troy realizes that growing up means you're just as dumb as your younger self, but with more responsibilities.
<ul><li> Both Troy and Abed devote extraordinary amounts of time and energy to subverting this trope. After building and entering a blanket fort:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Troy</strong>: You thinking what I'm thinking?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Abed</strong>: We're too big for this, aren't we?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Troy</strong>: (disappointed) Yeah...
</div><div class="indent">(beat)
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Troy</strong>: Bet if we went two pillows higher in the corner we could vault the ceiling, bump up the square footage. Make this a blanket fort for <em>men</em>.
</div></li><li> Apply some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> and you get this. Not too long after Tommy, Katherine, Tanya, and Adam graduate from high school, they pass the torch to T.J., Cassie, Ashley, and Carlos. The point was supposed to be, "You've done your duty, now go to better things." However, since they had the rug pulled out from under them pretty quickly by getting stripped of their powers, it made it look like turning 18 made them completely useless, a la Menudo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ResshaSentaiTokkyuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ResshaSentaiTokkyuger">Ressha Sentai Tokkyuger</a>,</em> we have a partial example: imagination is the key to being able to see the Rainbow Line (the magical tracks the Rangers' train travels on) and resist the Shadow Line (the bad guys.) Naturally, cue the scenes of kids waving hello or goodbye to the Rangers while their parents have no idea of what they're seeing, or a child or group of children being the only ones not ensnared by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>'s spell. However, there are children who don't have the imagination to see the Rangers' train come through due to bad things in their lives, and of course the ToQgers themselves are the ones with the most imagination, and they're teenagers. So you have things only children can see because of an <em>actual reason</em> other than "it's a perk of childhood that magically, instantly switches off at a certain birthday," and that leads to there being a few kids who can't see it and a few adults who can.
</li><li> Epitomized in this monologue from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>: "I don't know what's real anymore. When I was young, my mother told me Santa Claus was real. But when I got older... she told me he wasn't. One book says Jesus is real; one book says he isn't. We're living in the greatest country in the world... and we're murdering each other in the streets. What did they expect when they made us believe in the tooth fairy and the Easter Bunny then gave us the nuclear bomb to play with. Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle is a lie like all the rest, the astronauts killed the man in the moon, growing up took care of the rest." Made sadder because the speaker is a friend of Harry's dad Buddy— and mentally ill (he spends most of the episode not talking at all).
</li><li> A recurring theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced">Spaced</a></em>; all the main characters are pretty immature and have difficulty accepting the fact that they're not kids anymore.

<div class="indent"><strong>Tim:</strong> We've potentially destroyed her faith in today's youth! <br/><em>[Everyone looks at him skeptically]</em> <br/><strong>Tim:</strong> <em>[Sheepish]</em> Young adults.

Only one of the Russo kids (the one who's found to be the most experienced) will get to keep their magic when they reach adulthood.

See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> and throw in the fact that the producers recognize the Jalex fandom and... well...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> has this as a major theme. The main character Kouta used to be a member of a team of street dancers, but "retired" in order to get a real job and prove to his older sister that he can take care of himself. Unfortunately at first he's not up on the idea, and quickly falls back in with his old friends while using his Rider powers for personal gain. Things start to change after he almost gets killed by another Rider, which sees him go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> before recovering and finally acting more responsible.
</li><li> Will Byers in Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>.

However, he doesn't see what's so great about all the things that come along with being an adult, like mortgages and ditching all your dreams. Although he thinks it's fine if you like that stuff, he'd rather stay a kid at heart. The title of the song comes from him telling the listener that, if all you do with your life is sit around and photosynthesize, then you deserve every moment you waste, just thinking about when you're going to die. The music video has Frank Turner and his band singing this song with a class of kindergartners.

While they have a consistent sound of innocence and nostalgia, there's usually an undercurrent of anxiety with the idea of adulthood, with some songs also tackling increasingly relevant "mature" topics such as sexism, racism, loneliness and depression, parenting, and death. An excerpt from "Let's Go To the Forest:

The sidequest starts to come to this when you realize what happened to the Eeveelution trainers; The Glaceon trainer decided to give up battling to settle down and live with her family, the Leafeon trainer is trying to maintain her beauty and youth via various treatments but is slowly coming down with arthritis, the Jolteon trainer has forgotten about Kagetora and appears to have Alzheimer's, the Vaporeon and Flareon trainers became janitors, the Espeon trainer remained as a Janitor at the power plant, the Umbreon trainer is chronically ill, and the Sylveon trainer died a year before the game events, leaving her Sylveon with her granddaughter. After beating all of them, they tell a somber anecdote about life and then tell you that they asked how Kagetora is doing. When you finally defeat Kagetora, he thanks for doing what he failed to do years ago and leaves you his Eevium Z. The sidequest shows how life doesn't always go to plan, and shows how one can't rely on Pokémon battling to make ends meet.

They don't refuse because they have been fooled by the others into thinking it is a great place, possibly intentionally (since they do have scout and foraging groups). The Lone Wanderer can help improve things by shoring up Big Town's defenses, softening the blow... but still, you can learn that the prostitute hanging around in the Megaton bar came from Little Lamplight.

Being constantly stalked by psychopath killers and "the forces of darkness", growing up almost invariably means you'll be defenseless against them. Considering said stalkers can find out you have Rooder blood and would like to prevent you from having offspring who can fight them back, your life will be incredibly fun from that point on.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>: Timmy will automatically lose Cosmo and Wanda — and his memories of them — when he reaches his eighteenth birthday... if he doesn't screw up before then. This adds a melancholic note to the series by underlining the fact that Timmy, while clearly loved by his godparents, is not unique but rather just one of a long list of godchildren they've cared for.
<ul><li> Actually, one episode implies that he <em>is</em> unique. While Cosmo and Wanda have a hallway in their miniature castle dedicated to their past godchildren (good and bad each), they have an entire <em>room</em> dedicated to Timmy. Of course, one could also argue that they may do this for whatever child they're currently caring for, and Timmy will just become another single portrait in a hall.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand">Trapped in TV Land</a> movie, Timmy is shown to grow up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">be almost exactly like his cheerfully oblivious father, turning the care of his kids over to an insane, Vicky-esque robotic babysitter, though the memory wipe may be to blame for his failure to learn from his father's mistakes.

This is due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> he had found, where people with a child-like heart are still allowed to keep their fairies.
</li><li> This becomes a plot point in <em>Timmy's Secret Wish</em>. It's revealed that he secretly wished that he and everyone else would stop aging so he can keep his fairies forever...<em>fifty years ago</em>!

Especially ironic is the fact that not only do they grow up and out of their roles as KND operatives, they turn into the enemy (teenagers/adults).

<ul><li> Many children in the show consider this inevitability, and decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">betray them now rather than later</a>.
</li><li> In the series finale, adulthood is stated to be a <em>disease</em>. To hammer the point in even further, the adult versions of Sector V are portrayed as live-action actors rather than animated characters.
</li><li> However, some characters like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Numbuh One's dad, the former Numbuh Zero</span>, present the idea that growing up to be good parents to the current children is good and important enough for them to give up their adventures as KND operatives.

In this case the sword hanging over Bloo's head is that, should Mac ever stop coming and/or grow out of needing an imaginary friend, Bloo will be given up for adoption. As fates go, this isn't especially cruel since adults can still see and visit their old imaginary friends (there's even a "class reunion" day for it!), but pretty much <em>every</em> adult has eventually put their imaginary friend up for adoption, and since imaginary friends live at least(?) as long as real people, they can end up seeing many different owners. The only exception is Madam Foster, owner and founder of Foster's Home.
<ul><li> Though Madam Foster and Frankie both seem to believe that Mac may possess the qualities to stay with his imaginary friend forever as well.
</li><li> At least he won't dissolve into thin air once Mac gives him up, which is often used in series with premises like this.

He and Patrick go to Grandma's house to show her how manly they are with false sideburns. When Patrick starts getting spoiled by SpongeBob's Grandma, she lures SpongeBob back to childhood by feeding him steamed coral while Patrick gets cookies, reading Patrick a kiddie book while SpongeBob is given a boring book on routine active maintenance, and breaking the straw by giving Patrick a sweater with loving in the stitches while SpongeBob gets office supplies... and they weren't even wrapped up. Eventually he breaks down crying that he doesn't want to grow up, but Grandma tells him that no matter how old he gets, she will always love him like she did when he was a baby.

<ul><li> The show has "You're Getting Old", where Stan turns 10 and realizes how shitty things are progressively getting to the point of seeing and hearing nothing but shit, a disorder called by a doctor "Being a cynical asshole". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This leads to an end of his friendships and with his mother divorcing Randy after not being able to take his shenanigans anymore, moving away from South Park</span>

While he doesn't grow to enormous size and go on a hoarding frenzy like in "Secret of My Excess", Spike does suffer through a host of embarrassing and painful symptoms, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseOfZitboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseOfZitboy">breaking out in a rash called "stone-scale"</a>, indigestion that causes him to uncontrollably belch huge gouts of fire, sudden changes in his speaking volume, and emitting a foul stench that tends to attract dangerous magical creatures, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">rocs</a>.

<ul><li> This trope is Mabel's character arc. Almost every episode she's in that involves dealing with the changes and responsibilities that come with getting older; In "Summerween", she laments that she and Dipper won't be able to go trick-or-treating someday, and "Boss Mabel" gives her a very good idea of what kind of challenge running a business entails. But the worst comes in "Dipper and Mabel Vs the Future", where's all of Mabel's naive expectations of high school life are shot down <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leading her to inadvertently cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> when offered the chance to freeze time.</span> "Weirdmageddon Part 2: Escape From Reality" has Dipper point out that the reason Mabel's such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlurgeAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlurgeAddict">Glurge Addict</a> is because escapism is how she's trying to deal with her fear of growing up.
</li><li> Inverted with Dipper, with his arc being centered around trying to grow up too fast. Several of his storylines involve him trying to act older than he is (his crush for a bulk of the series being a teenager a few years older than him not helping) or otherwise neglect his own childhood, to the point where he seriously considers taking up a chance to spend his whole life being devoted to studying the supernatural out in a secret lab in "Dipper and Mabel Vs the Future." It's not a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGrowingUpSucks">Not Growing Up Sucks</a>, as Dipper is mortal and ages normally; he essentially wants to skip to being an adult.
</li><li> "Soos and the Real Girl" has Soos retreat to a kiddie arcade to relax and ride a train simulator after getting stressed out over horribly botching every attempt at meeting a girlfriend he makes.

Though more importantly she realizes she missed out on things like graduation and college before ultimately reversing the spell to grow up naturally and enjoy her childhood while she can. Making this more "Growing up too fast sucks".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> had one episode where Roger turns the Smiths home into a Spring Break resort. Stan is initially against it but eventually comes to like the party life and even make a friend in a college student. Eventually the week passes, Francine (who was away on a trip) comes home and chastises Stan for allowing it and Stan's friend has to leave. He tries to follow her to keep the friendship going but end up like a creepy stalker and interferes with her studies. However the reason he does is because Francine never pays much attention to his stories anymore. And Francine's adopted mother even <em>call her out on this</em>, telling her that that's what a relationship needs to keep the spark going as they get older and Francine has been taking it for granted.
<ul><li> When Steve gets his first pubic hair, Stan and Francine immediately have PTSD flashbacks of Haley's puberty and decide to use CIA formulas to meddle with his age. However, Francine uses it to keep Steve young just for a few months...and it backfires and turns him into a toddler. Stan gives him an overdose of the formula so that Steve will skip puberty and become twenty-one...and <em>it</em> backfires and turns Steve into an old man. Then when they get a formula that will restore Steve to his proper age, he runs away after overhearing them talk about all the negatives of puberty and growing up. Finally, Steve is administered the antidote so he can do the one thing he wanted to do and prove he's ready for puberty: go to the dance with his girlfriend. And then a drunk Roger (who's jealous that Steve is getting all the attention on his birthday) ruins it by pantsing him in front of all the kids at the dance and revealing his single pubic hair, resulting in him getting grabbed by a group of bullies and given a swirly.
