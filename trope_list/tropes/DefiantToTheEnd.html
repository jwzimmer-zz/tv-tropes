</p><p>Hell no.
</p><p>They make it abundantly clear that they have absolutely no respect for their captor. They'd never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod">Kneel Before Zod</a> in a million years, and they're not afraid in the slightest to say so. Sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Baron Bloodlust</a> could kill them where they stand if he decided to, but you wouldn't know that from the insults. This is done when a defeated character laughs or snarks at the one who beat them, often when they're in no position to do so, possibly broken in pain on the floor or behind bars. This could even be for something that has absolutely nothing to do with them. They just can't let the other character get a complete victory.
</p><p>This can be an important part of the end for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">Doomed Moral Victor</a>: if you can't die fighting, you can at least die verbally sparring.

</p><p>Note that this isn't exclusive to heroes.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> is a military version of this trope, where the heroes and maybe a friendly army will fight against the enemy in a battle they know they can't win. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor">Villainous Valor</a> is a similar trope, but with the villain being defiant to the end while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">Sore Loser</a> is arguably a much less pleasant version of this.

They are captured by a tribe of fierce headhunters. The witch doctor says to them, "We are going to slaughter you, but you might take some comfort in the fact that we don't believe in waste here, and that therefore every part of your body will go to some use. We will weave baskets out of your hair, we will render your bones for glue, and we will tan your skin and stretch it over wooden frames for canoes. Now we are going to allow you an honorable death, so I will give you each a knife and allow you to say some last words before killing yourselves."
<div class="indent">The Japanese guy yells "Banzai!" and commits hara-kiri. <br/>The French guy yells "Vive la France!" and slits his throat. <br/>Then the American guy takes the knife, pokes holes all over his body, and yells, "There's your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fucking</a> canoe!"

</li><li> Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour didn't like Harry and the feeling was mutual. Despite this, during the Death Eater coup of the Ministry, he withstood torture from <em>Voldemort himself</em> in his final moments, yet refused to divulge any information about Harry's whereabouts.
</li><li> And then there's Gellert Grindelwald, who was considered to be the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard in the world before Voldemort came along. When confronted by Voldemort himself, wandless and helpless, instead of going along with Voldy's demands, Grindelwald openly defies him and even <em>laughs in his face</em>.

Several human beings are before an intergalactic court that will decide whether the human race will be destroyed. Two of them (a Roman centurion and a modern-day teenager) get angry and chew out the aliens for their high-handedness (the Roman uses language that's not fit for polite company). In a Subversion, the teenager finally asks, as a favor, to be returned home and share his species' fate if the decision goes against humanity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The human race is given a reprieve.</span>

So what does he do? He keeps swinging his axe against the horde of orcs and trolls all around him, and for every troll he kills, he cries "Auré enteluva (Day shall come again)!" He kills <em>over 70 trolls</em> before being taken.
</li><li> After being captured, he defies <em>Morgoth himself</em>, mocking him and refusing to say anything about Turgon and his stronghold. Even if this defiance is remembered as a great deed, he pays dearly for it.

</li><li> This actually comes up quite often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>; characters often get killed <em>stupidly</em>, but they're always defiant.

Which turned out to be <em>nonfunctional</em>, making the death of the first (but by no means the last) character with a speaking role in the movies entirely pointless.

<ul><li> At one point he starts mouthing off to a bigger bad guy than usual, and everyone is horrified. He points out that if he <em>didn't</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> might feel left out.

This is followed by Harry's usual eloquence for declarative statements, when the person asked if he was sure, "Fuck off."

</li><li> Soldier-turned-devout-priest Hauwerd Wylsynn in the fourth book, <em>A Mighty Fortress</em> doesn't give the Inquisition a chance to haul information out of him through torture, so he instead chooses to die. He takes at least four armed and armored soldiers with him.
</li><li> The fifth book, <em>How Firm a Foundation</em> shows Charisian captain Gwylym Manthyr about to face the same punishment the archbishop above did. Grand Inquisitor Clyntahn asked if he wanted to deny any of the claims of blasphemy he was charged with, after having had his tongue cut out so he could do no such thing. Manthyr's response: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit">He spit in Clyntahn's face.</a>
</li><li> When Clyntahn himself is finally in this position at the end of <em>Hell's Foundations Quiver</em>, he goes through his arrest and trial with his usual arrogance, smug in the security that, whatever happens to him in this life, the Archangels will have a place for him at their side. The day before his execution, however, he receives two visitors, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merlin Athrawes and Nimue Chwaeriau, who proceed to tell him the truth about the "Archangels" and provide file footage of them to prove it</span>.

The King of England just occupied their homeland after a bloody war and demands they sing his praises. When they won't, he sends them to be burnt at the pyre. literally translated, "Five hundred, aye, singing, bards of Wales went to a grave of flame, but not one of them was able to say <em>Long live Edward</em>." <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01ndk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note01ndk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01ndk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to the footnotes of the poet, "Though history doubts it, it is a strongly held belief that King Edward the First, after the occupation of the province of Wales (1277), had five hundred welsh bards killed so that, in singing of the glorious past of their nation, they couldn't encourage the people to shake off the English yoke."</span>

After Montresor mocks his cry of "For the love of God, Montresor!", Fortunato notably falls completely silent. The moment is essentially Fortunato realizing that dooming him to a slow death is only his murderer's secondary objective; what Montresor actually wants is the satisfaction of hearing him begging and pleading for his life until the end while he gloats at and humiliates him. And correctly enough, Montresor's narration betrays the fact that he is indeed greatly annoyed and even a bit psyched out by Fortunato's sudden silence, so much so that he tries calling out his name twice, only to be further frustrated when no reply is forthcoming.

<ul><li> In "Sejanus", the Emperor Tiberius' great-nephew Nero is arrested for treason, then starved to death while imprisoned on the orders of Tiberius' enforcer, Sejanus, purely because he is ahead of Tiberius' grandson Gemellus in the line of succession (Sejanus is the lover of Gemellus' mother Livilla and aims to rule as regent when Gemellus becomes Emperor). Nero, believing that it is Tiberius at whose command he has been imprisoned, shouts curses at the Emperor until he no longer has the strength to do so.
</li><li> Nero's mother Agrippina, granddaughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a>, follows suit in the following episode, "Caligula". A political rival of Tiberius since his declaration as Emperor (first believing that her husband Germanicus should be Emperor instead, then pinning her hopes on Nero succeeding him), she is banished to the island of Pandataria at the same time Nero is imprisoned. When Tiberius indicates that he has no plans to reverse Sejanus' decision to exile her, she forcibly starves herself to death to ensure that her blood is on Tiberius' hands.
</li><li> Agrippina's other son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a> gets a defiant death scene in the last episode, "Claudius".

The episode's villain, an assassin working for the man who had Beckett's mother killed, has kidnapped Ryan and Esposito in order to find out what the good guys know about his employer. Then comes the following exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Assassin:</strong> Now, I'm gonna make you a deal: you tell me what I need to know, one pro to another, and I will put a bullet in your brain. You don't, you jerk me around, and you will be begging me to before this night is up. <br/><strong>Esposito:</strong> I'm gonna have to go with option B, bro. <br/><strong>Ryan:</strong> Oh yeah, we are definitely gonna jerk you around.
</div><ul><li> Ryan and Espo do a lot of it in this scene, from Ryan (after being dunked in a tub of ice water) saying "This is nothing. I went to Catholic school for twelve years, they did this to you just for talking in class." to Espo, having agreed to tell the bad guy what he wants to know, saying "The cops know all about... me and your mom."
</li><li> Montgomery got a truly heartbreaking one at the end of season three. He managed to take out all of the bad guys that came for Beckett except the Assassin mentioned above, who manages to fatally shoot him.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Assassin:</strong> This was all for nothing. I'm just gonna kill her anyway. <br/><strong>Montgomery:</strong> No you're not, and he's not. I saw to that. <em>-pulls out a gun and shoots Assassin point blank-</em>

A bullet between the eyes would have been preferable to this charade.

To realize that liars do not fear the truth if there are enough liars. That the devil is just one man with a plan, but evil, true evil, is a collaboration of men, which is what we have here today. If I am a guilty man, my crime is in daring to believe; that the truth will out and that no one lie can live forever. I believe it still. Much as you try to bury it, the truth is out there. Greater than your lies, the truth wants to be known. You will know it. It'll come to you, as it's come to me, faster than the speed of light.

Down, out, and all but defeated, he clawed his way up at the feet of what's probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">the most dominant force in WWE history</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> at WrestleMania). Knowing he was going to lose, but (as is definitely his nature) remaining defiant, Michaels mimicked Undertaker's "Throat cut" gesture. Undertaker didn't respond... so Shawn slapped him across the face. You could see the exact moment that Undertaker went from slightly merciful to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">PISSED OFF</a>. Cue Super Atomic Jumping Tombstone of Death.

Often acclaimed as the most dramatic of all of the Undertaker's matches in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> history, the final sequence goes as this: Triple H, beaten and broken, with his last breath, lunges towards 'Taker, sledgehammer in hand...and is stopped, 'Taker grabbing the sledgehammer, shaking his head. Triple H, knowing he is beaten, leans against the turnbuckles in the corner, and with one last act of defiance, performs a crotch-chop to 'Taker before having said sledgehammer rammed into his head, being hit with the Tombstone Piledriver, and being pinned.

He answered their questions with "eat my shorts" and "don't have a cow". In this case, Bart's insults and tough guy act actually impresses the mafia, convincing them to give him a job as a bartender.
<ul><li> It also helped that "Don't Have A Cow" and "Eat My Shorts" were the names of racehorses. And that Don't Have A Cow won that day's race, beating out Cowabunga and Yabba-Dabba-Doo.

When they eventually ran out of ammunition, the last five men <em>mounted a bayonet charge</em>. Beaten to the ground, the two survivors were offered one last chance to surrender. Their response? They demanded the right to keep their weapons and escort their commanding officer's body home. The Mexican commander agreed to their terms. It seemed churlish to refuse. Many years later, the Mexican government erected a monument <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">in memory of the French soldiers, and every year holds a parade to commemorate their last stand.</a>

</li><li> In 1809, during the Second Siege of Saragossa and at a point where the French had gained undeniable superiority, having even taken parts of the city, French general Verdier sent a message to the Spaniard's defending military demanding the surrender of the city, stating simply «Paz y capitulación.» ("Peace and surrender.").

<ul><li> Similarly, when the American 101st Airborne was surrounded by Germans in the city of Bastogne, the Germans sent a letter offering them the chance to surrender.

When McAuliffe and his staff were trying to decide how to word their refusal, Colonel Harry Kinnard suggested that his initial response summed it up pretty well. Colonel Joseph Harper then typed out the response and gave it to the German delegation, and when they were confused as to its meaning he "translated" it as "go to hell."</span>

When he, along with three other Russian soldiers, got captured by Chechen Islamists during the First Chechen War, he suffered torture for several days because he refused to renounce his Christian faith and convert to Islam as demanded by the Islamists. Even when he was threatened with an army knife, he still refused to give up his faith, which got his throat slit by the said knife. Due to his defiance, he has become a sort of national hero in Russia, and many people even demand that he should be canonized to sainthood.
<ul><li> Though one of the reasons he was not made a saint is that the Russian Orthodox church doubted the story was fiction on part of his mother.

</li><li> Most of the Norwegian society shared this opinion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly">1814</a> when they knew they were sold out to Sweden in an international bargain. This defiance paid off in a written constitution, and later on, even more defiance secured them their sovereign right to rule themselves inside a loose union with Sweden. The awesomeness in this hangs on the fact that the Swedes time and again were willing to use military force against them. In one crucial situation, the speaker of parliament had this information handed to him in a secret letter ("Do as we wish or risk another war"). His reaction: to burn the letter, never mentioning it, and voting <em>against</em> the Swedish demands, securing a majority in parliament. Defiant indeed. For the sake of good will, the Swedes grudgingly accepted it (and were more than a little impressed).
<ul><li> During the Norwegian-Swedish war in 1814, the fortress of Halden stood its ground against Swedish attacks for two weeks without surrendering. This fortress surrendered only <em>after</em> the official capitulation, and the Swedish command honored the Norwegian soldiers for their defiance.

He was a Sri Lankan man who joined the Ceylon colonial forces due to his anti-fascist idealism, in hopes that he would fight against the Japanese, but he became disillusioned when he and other natives were victims of British discrimination. Inspired by the Japanese-supported resistance movements in Burma and Indonesia, he and other Sri Lankan soldiers started a mutiny against the colonial authority but it was crushed and Fernando was taken prisoner and executed. His last words were: "Loyalty to a country under the heel of a white man is disloyalty".
</li><li> Different historical accounts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> assassination indicated that his killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, refused to admit his acts, even as he lay dying (after himself being shot by Jack Ruby) in the garage of the Dallas Police Station. (Although one interpretation, where an officer asked the badly wounded Oswald if he'd like to make a statement and he simply nodded his head "no" as he moaned in pain, could be that he was entering shock.)
</li><li> Media accounts published at the time of Timothy McVeigh's execution (for masterminding the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing) noted that McVeigh — after he was placed inside the death chamber — that his face was one of defiance, even as the drugs took effect, and he smirked and held an evil expression until he finally lost consciousness.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> John Wayne Gacy's last words before facing execution were "Kiss my ass! You'll never find the rest!"
</li><li> The last words of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Hannibal Barca</a> after the Roman legions that had been chasing him for years were finally within striking distance, which prompted Hannibal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">take poison</a> rather than let himself be captured and paraded back to Rome before being executed, were "Let us relieve the Romans from the anxiety they have so long experienced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">since they think it tries their patience too much to wait for an old man's death</a>."
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFallOfConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFallOfConstantinople">The Fall of Constantinople</a>, the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Emperor</a> Constantine XI was told to surrender the city to the besieging Ottomans or face death along with the rest of the defenders. Knowing the hopelessness of the situation, his response was this: "Giving you the city depends neither on me nor on anyone else among its inhabitants; as we have all decided to die with our own free will and we shall not consider our lives." When Ottoman flags were seen flying over the postern gates of the city and Byzantine defences crumbled Constantine reportedly led a final, doomed charge against the invaders, dying in the streets with his soldiers. Suffice to say, he did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">his ancestors proud</a>.
<ul><li> Other reports suggest that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">he hanged himself at this point</a>, but that isn't as cool.
</li></ul></li><li> Nelson Mandela never gave in, even when he thought he was about to be executed for planning uMkhonte we Sizwe's armed campaign, even when he was told he would never leave the hellish Robben Island prison, even when he learned his son had died while he was imprisoned, and in the end it paid off for him. The most noted example of his determination was at the Rivonia Trial, when everyone thought he would be given the death penalty, he stood in the dock and gave his three-hour speech in which he set out his motivations, his ideology, and his vision of the just and free society he would eventually try to create when he was finally released:
<div class="indent">"During my lifetime I have dedicated my life to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realised. <strong>But, My Lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.</strong>"
</div><ul><li> As he delivered the final line, he looked Judge Quartus de Wet straight in the eye, an action which Mandela later credited with saving his life, as he felt that, directly dared to order his execution, de Wet didn't have enough ice in his veins to go through with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Hale">Nathan Hale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a 21-year-old soldier for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">Continental Army</a>. He volunteered for an intelligence-gathering mission in British-occupied New York and was captured. His last words before being hanged are considered some of the most inspirational in American history, and have been used a rallying cry for over two centuries:
<div class="indent">"I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country."
</div></li><li> Irma Grese, "the Hyena of Auschwitz". A sadistic and perverted concentration camp guardian who had tortured and murdered scores of prisoners and was believed to be the inspiration for the film <em>Isla: She-Wolf Of The SS</em>, she was sentenced to death by hanging after WWII. Her last word to her executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, was <em>Schnell</em> (literally "Speed!", meaning "Have speed with it!"); in our terms, she basically said "Hurry". Grese died as a truly unrepentant Nazi.
</li><li> In 1968, Alexander Dubček of the government of Communist Czechoslovakia announced a period of political liberalization and reform, granting the citizens freedom of speech, movement, and travel, raising the possibility of a mixed economy and even multiparty politics. This was known as "socialism with a human face". The USSR didn't like that. Not one bit. So on 21st August 1968, they and their allies invaded Czechoslovakia and installed a new puppet government to roll back Dubček's reforms and return to socialism <em>sans</em> human face. Dubček and 25 other senior reformers were kidnapped, taken to Moscow, and made to sign a humiliating "Protocol" rolling back the reforms. Only one man refused, Frantiek Kriegel, a politician-doctor who had served in the Spanish Civil War:
<div class="indent">"Send me to Siberia or shoot me dead."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III of England</a>. He was the last English king to die in battle. Despite suffering from scoliosis, an extremely painful condition that causes curvature of the spine (these days it's usually fixed by getting the sufferer to wear a back brace, usually from an early age, but in the 15th century there was nothing to counter it), he didn't go down without a fight; he even managed to unhorse one of Henry Tudor's bodyguards, and came close to actually killing Henry.
</li><li> A non-deadly but still depressing example: The Nazis did not take power unopposed. In the final vote that would give Hitler the power to make laws on his own (thereby eliminating the last legal barrier to his total control) the communists had already been rounded up and sent to prison or worse. The parties of the center-right had made deals with the Nazis (or so they hoped). The last party that wanted to say something against Hitler and was still present to do so were the social democrats. Otto Wels (1873-1939 in exile in Paris) held a speech culminating in the words "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmhB6D1_AIc">They can take our freedom and our lives. But they cannot take our honor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Given what happened next, this took guts.
</li><li> Another with the Nazis: When Paris was fully occupied during WWII, the French destroyed the elevator to the Eiffel Tower, for the sole purpose of making life difficult for the Nazis if they decided to raise their flag on the tower. Without an elevator, the Nazis would have to climb hundreds of stairs.
</li><li> Still another regarding Nazis, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannie_Schaft">Hannie Schaft<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, The Girl With the Red Hair. A member of a Dutch resistance movement who orchestrated many assassinations and sabotage efforts against the Germans, she was eventually caught and shot. As the story goes, two soldiers were tasked in doing so, but the first only wounded her, despite shooting at close range. Supposedly, she told him, "I shoot better than you," before she was killed by his partner.
</li><li> When Queen Mary I had Thomas Cranmer burned at the stake for heresy, he said his only regret was that he signed six recantations of his Protestant faith, going so far as to personally put his right hand into the torch that served as the instrument of his execution to punish <em>it</em> for signing those recantations in the first place. He didn't just take his martyrdom for his Protestant beliefs at the hands of Bloody Mary, he <em>owned</em> it, helping the popularity of the Protestant movement grow in the aftermath of his death.
</li><li> Pretty much the MO of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Japanese forces</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. There's a pretty good reason why there were much fewer prisoners taken in by the Allies, as they preferred death before surrender. This attitude actually triggered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>: given an invasion of the Japanese mainland would almost certainly result in the aforesaid cranked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> (meaning any plan they had for a conventional invasion predicted mass casualties), the Americans instead decided to resort to a couple of atomic bombs in hopes the Japanese would see overwhelming force as a reason to stop.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30igk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30igk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30igk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some would argue the atomic bombs weren't the main reason for the surrender but the threat of the Soviets invading Japan. As determined as the Japanese were, the Soviets could easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> them and leave nothing in their wake; defiance would be meaninglessno one would be around to remember it. Some people have even argued that despite the horrors the Atomic bombs unleashed, considering the revelations relating to Soviet war crimes that emerged after the fall of the USSR, the nukes may have actually <em>saved</em> more people than if the Russians managed to reach the Japanese main islands...</span>
</li><li> A downplayed example, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineOfAragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineOfAragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>'s first wife, could be seen as an example of this. After her marriage to Henry was annulled against her will, she was referred to as Princess Dowager (in reference to her being the widow to Henry's brother Prince Arthur - a marriage she firmly claimed was not consummated) but refused to accept this. On her deathbed, she wrote a final letter to her former husband and signed it as Catherine the Queen.
</li><li> In 1834, Moroccan Jewish teenager Sol Hauchel was falsely accused of converting to Islam. Brought before the Muslim governor for ludicrous charges of heresy, she was offered wealth and privilege if she accepted conversion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">apparently because her beauty was legendary among both Jews and Muslims</a>, or face imprisonment and torture. She responded:
<div class="indent"> I will patiently bear the weight of your chains; I will give my limbs to be torn piece-meal by wild beasts; I will renounce forever the light of day: I will perish of hunger: and when all the evils of life are accumulated on me by your orders, I will smile at your indignation, and the anger of your Prophet: since neither he nor you have been able to overcome a weak female! It is clear that Heaven is not auspicious to making proselytes your faith.
</div><ul><li> Eventually she was locked up and isolated. But even then, she refused conversion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">even when other Jewish leaders were begging her to convert</a>, but she was beheaded as an apostate. The Muslims themselves were also hesitant to kill her and gave her several chances too - the governor allegedly instructed the executor to strike her lightly first in hopes that seeing her own blood would frighten her into accepting conversion. She earned the nickname "The Righteous Sol".
</li></ul></li><li> During World War II, the British armed merchant cruiser (a passenger ship converted into a light warship to raid enemy shipping) <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Rawalpindi">HMS Rawalpindi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> bit off more than it could chew when it investigated some sightings and found itself staring down the gun barrels of the powerful German battlecruisers <em>Scharnhorst</em> and <em>Gneisenau</em>. Despite being <em>incomprehensibly</em> outgunned, they refused German demands to surrender and attacked instead, scoring one damaging hit on <em>Scharnhorst</em> before going down. Before his suicidal attack, Captain Edward Kennedy was heard to declare "Well fight them both, theyll sink us, and that will be that. Good-bye."
</li><li> Father Jacques Hamel was a Catholic priest in Normandy who was murdered in 2016 when his church was attacked by Islamic terrorists. His last words he said to his attackers were "Be gone, Satan!"
</li><li> Emiliano Zapata (later quoted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MidnightOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MidnightOil">Midnight Oil</a>):
<div class="indent">It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
</div></li><li> Two Governors of Hà Nội <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4rs6m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4rs6m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4rs6m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">technically Hà Ninh, comprising of Hà Nội and Ninh Bình</span> went out this way during the French takeover.
<ul><li> Nguyễn Tri Phương was wounded and captured at the end of a horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> (the only French casualty was one soldier shot by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFire">Friendly Fire</a>). He received French medical attention but refused any further care. He went on a hunger strike that lasted one month and resulted in his death at the age of 73, reasoning that "Now, miserably lingering on through life is no replacement for dying peacefully for a cause."
</li><li> His replacement Hoàng Diệu commanded a battle that almost ended in Vietnamese victory, until the gunpowder reserves blew up, killing, wounding, distracting and demoralizing the forces. He kept fighting until defeat was imminent, then ordered the forces to scatter. He went into the palace, bit his finger and wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen">a letter to the Emperor Tự Đức in blood</a>, then hanged himself with his own turban in front of the Temple of Martial Arts.
</li></ul><div class="indent">The citadel is irretrievably lost, I am ashamed to face the people and gentlemen of the North. It is no hardship for myself to die, I pledge to follow Nguyễn Tri Phương into the earth. Your Majesty is leagues away, we weep tears of blood for you...
</div></li><li> During the Night of the Long Knives, a 1934 Nazi purge to eliminate those viewed as obstacles of the new regime, SA leader Ernst Röhm was given the opportunity to kill himself in custody. His response was to declare that if Hitler wanted him dead, he could do it himself. After he said this, his guards left, and when they returned, they saw him standing in his cell with his bare chest puffed out.
