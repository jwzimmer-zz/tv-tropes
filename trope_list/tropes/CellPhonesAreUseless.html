It's become a laughable cliché."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Mathew Buck</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown">Bad Movie Beatdown</a></em> on <a class="urllink" href="http://blip.tv/film-brain/bad-movie-beatdown-christmas-special-while-she-was-out-4489242">"While She was Out"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</div></div><p>With the advent of the computer age, writers still don't quite know how to work Cell Phones into a story. It used to be all you had to do for a survival adventure story was plop a bunch of people away from electricity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">completely strand them</a> at the mercy of wild animals/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">serial killers</a>/zombies  but cell phones are making that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH2B9F-GPm0">harder and harder for writers to do believably<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even in comedy situations, there are some plotlines (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInARoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInARoom">Locked in a Room</a>) that only work if the characters don't have cellphones. This means that cellphones are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIZVcRccCx0">lost, broken, stolen, and run out of power far more than they should<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The range of cellphones is also ridiculously reduced from what they are in real life even if elsewhere in the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCellReception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCellReception">reception is better than normal</a>  maybe writers are confusing them with two-way radios, or don't realise that most modern phones allow long-distance and international calls.

However, in many situations where this trope takes place, the problem is far more localized; being lost in the werewolf-infested woods isn't a national emergency.
</p><p>A simpler solution is to mention that cell phones are not an available option: the guy has just lost it, forgot it at home, or even refuses to have one to begin with (such as those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWithTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWithTech">Hopeless with Tech</a>).

</p><p>The period the work is set in or created in, the lifestyle of the characters involved, as well as the setting have a major influence over when this trope applies. A rich character living in a major metropolitan area could reasonably expect to have a cell phone on their person (and coverage in the metropolitan area) by the early '90s or so. By 2000, 50% of Americans owned cell phones; and by 2015, 93% of Americans owned smartphones. Coverage steadily increased from major metropolitan areas only in the '80s to near complete coverage except in some extreme rural areas/wilderness by 2015.

<ul><li> One justification for not using a cellphone was shown in an old campaign from the early 2000s by T-Mobile for their unlimited plan. This was before all companies even <em>had</em> unlimited plans, and had a set amount of "minutes" that you could talk on the phone for free. After that, you'd have to pay-per-minute. In these commercials, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> as the spokesperson, some sort of emergency would be presented and a group of people would argue over whether or not to risk wasting their minutes. This would make it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> if the party in question isn't using their cellphone because they're out of minutes.
<ul><li> Many people are still using pay-per-minute plans, as they generally don't have contracts with high early termination fees and they can work out to be cheaper than unlimited plans if you don't make many phone calls. But even on a phone with no SIM card or any minutes, as long as it has power and a signal, you can dial 911 in North America or 112 in Europe (in some cases, both of those numbers work, with one redirecting to the other), and even a locked phone is capable of making an "Emergency Call" to these numbers.
</li><li> In fact, United States and Canadian Federal Law requires ALL cell phones to be able to dial 911, even if there is no sim card installed, the phone was never assigned to a carrier, and even if the phone is registered as stolen.

The result of this is that Cloud and Vincent's reluctance to use phones (Cloud only uses his voicemail, and Vincent doesn't own one at all) is a symbol of their inability to integrate themselves into normal life, and so when Cloud refuses to call for back-up it's all right, because it's all a metaphor. Tifa lectures Cloud about how not getting rid of his cell phone shows he still cares about people deep down, and Vincent later announcing his surprise arrival to help the heroes out after all with the line "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">where can I buy a phone</a>?" At the end, Vincent buys a phone and Cloud starts using his again properly.

(Well, can't expect a <em>centipede with a flaming skull on top</em> to have much appreciation for modern technology, anyway.) The good guys use spell charms to communicate, but the one dangerous occasion where everyone thinks to carry one before hand, they all get disabled in their enemy's first attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>, Izumi gets her cell phone <a class="urllink" href="http://www.onemanga.com/Hayate_the_Combat_Butler/137/08/">stolen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a scene that doesn't seem to have any effect on the overall storyline.

A similar problem comes up in the next episode, but with Homura instead of Mami. Besides the weirdness of Mami not giving her number to either of her student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a>, the cellphone avoidance is unnecessary, since there aren't really any situations where being able to call someone would have made a huge difference. In fact, if Madoka had called <em>Sayaka</em> in episode 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that would have helpfully explained Sayaka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment a few minutes later.</span>
<ul><li> This is, of course, assuming that cell phones would function well in or near witch barriers — technology is notoriously spotty when the supernatural rears its head.

Of course, given how much influence the Egrigori have over everyone, it probably wouldn't have done them much good even if she <em>was</em> able to call for help.
</li><li> In the visual-novel based series <em>White Album</em>, a significant portion of drama comes from people waiting around for calls on their land line phones. Keep in mind that the anime was produced in 2009 which is well after cell phones achieved ubiquity in Japan.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a></em> features an early example. Although it would be believable for cell phones not to be present at all in the graphic novel's setting (given that it's set in or around 1998), a reporter is seen attempting to call out of town only to find that her cell phone doesn't work after the town of Kurozu-cho has gone full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">Closed Circle</a>.

Touya Mochizuki initially notes that he'll be unable to recharge his smartphone in the fantasy world as he would in the real world, but he can use magic to recharge it. Additionally, he is no longer able to use it to communicate with anyone in the real world, but can use it to communicate with God. However, he can still use it to access the real world's internet and keep up with its goings-on. God also tweaked the phone's map function to display maps of the fantasy world instead of the real world.

<ul><li> In 2010, the series' title character was seriously injured in a car accident, caused by a young woman whose car veers into the path of Funky's car while she was talking on a cellular telephone while driving. He then appears to readers in the following day's strip as though he simply drove off the road and was uninjured. He attempts to call for help on his cell phone but is unable to get it to work. He then realizes he is in Westview as it appeared in 1980, and had seen (and in some cases, visited with) teen-aged versions of himself, Crazy Harry and Holly Budd (Funky's wife-to-be), and a younger Mr. Dinkle - all as they appeared in Funky Winkerbean strips in the early 1980s. It is only several days later that readers realize the seriousness of Funky's injuries that had rendered him unconscious, and that he was dreaming.
</li><li> As late as 2011, Les Moore (Funky's best friend and one of the main characters) did not own a cell phone, causing situations such as him not realizing that his daughter was injured during a game.

<ul><li> The first phone call from a truly portable handset (still the size of a brick, though) to the general phone network was made on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">April 3, 1973</a>, by Motorola's Martin Cooper, and by 1979 the world's first mobile network appeared in Japan, though initially only around Tokyo. So it's possible that by 1983 it reached Hinamizawa (the nationwide coverage was achieved in 1984), but it's still unlikely that modern phones (most of which are 2G systems like GSM) would work on this 1G system.

The protagonists spend a good deal of time chasing after a satellite phone instead. Any cell phones that they might have had would have been useless; they were on an island far from any towers. This is mixed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack">Behind the Black</a> moment, when they hear the sound of the phone but not the freaking huge dinosaur approaching in whose stomach the phone is.

<div class="indent"><strong>Cop:</strong> I can understand [teenagers] burning cell phones — rebellion against your parents and all that. But who the hell steals satellite phones and burns them?

This creates some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, as you can't help but wonder what the killers would have done if they had been able to call the police.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em> supposedly took place in 1994 because if it took place in 1998, it'd be too implausible that none of the main characters has a working cell phone. Of course, with all the implications that supernatural forces were at work, it's doubtful they would've functioned properly even if they were present.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Domino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Domino">Domino</a></em>, the title character is on the phone getting instructions, and thanks to poor reception she hears <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"remove the sleeve from his upper right arm"</span> as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"remove the right arm"</span>, with predictable results.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWayOfTheGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWayOfTheGun">The Way of the Gun</a></em>, various characters have difficulty reaching each other due to their junky cell phones failing to work.

Many simultaneously respond, "I've got a cellphone." All of them reach for their phones, but none of them can get a signal. Again, it's presented as a sign of supernatural interference.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErinBrockovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErinBrockovich">Erin Brockovich</a></em>. Whilst in a late-night diner Erin comes across a rather creepy man who seems to be making overtures, though it turns out he has access to crucial documents that could help the case. When Erin steps out to her car to call her boss for advice she finds her cellphone isn't working, so she makes a rush for a nearby payphone instead. This is justified though, since the film takes place in the early 1990s and many small towns or rural areas didn't have cell phone service yet.
</li><li> Realistically treated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHost">The Host</a></em>, where Hyun-seo is trapped in the sewer without a recharger and with terrible reception. She's able to get one call through, which is what starts off much of the plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PanicRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PanicRoom">Panic Room</a></em>, the heroine and her daughter are trapped in the panic room while the house is being robbed. They immediately go for the land line, only to remember that she never hooked it up, thinking it was unnecessary. In a suspenseful trip outside the room, she manages to get a cellphone, only to find there's no reception in the steel-plated walls, which essentially turns the panic room into a dead zone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shrooms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shrooms">Shrooms</a></em>, a bunch of teenagers go into the wilderness to eat shrooms and do wacky teen stuff.

And all of a sudden all their phones are missing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out the killer hid all of them right before starting the killing spree.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragMeToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragMeToHell">Drag Me to Hell</a></em> had the protagonist pull out her cell phone during a haunting.

Oh Lamia, you are such a card.

Naturally, the first thing Gordon does when he finds the phone is to attempt to call the police, but it turns out that the phone is somehow modified to only receive calls, and not even dialing 911 works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FunnyGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FunnyGames">Funny Games</a></em>, the killers "accidentally" knock the cell phone into a sink full of water thereby killing it, very much truth in television.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/P2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/P2">P2</a></em>, the heroine tries to use her cell phone to call the police after she's been kidnapped. Unfortunately, there's no reception, and when she finally does manage to make the 911 call, the call disconnects within seconds. Justified, since the heroine is locked in an underground parking garage.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowWhenTheWarBegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowWhenTheWarBegan">Tomorrow: When the War Began</a></em> sets up the fact that the main characters can't get cell phone coverage while camping as they are too isolated early on. When they return to town to discover that everything seems abandoned, they all check their cell phones, only to discover that they <em>still</em> can't get coverage (presumably as the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">invading army</span> has in some way caused the towers to go down). This circumvents the issue of why no one tried to contact them to warn them, and why they can't later use their cell phones to contact each other. The novel was published before cell phones were as ubiquitous as they are now.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCall">The Call</a></em>. The majority of the film is driven by the conversation between a 911 operator and a kidnapped girl locked in the trunk of a car.

</li><li> Part of what drives the drama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRuins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRuins">The Ruins</a></em> is that regular cell phones can't get reception in the middle of nowhere in South America, but one of the characters claims his brother, lost at the site, has a "world phone" that would connect (presumably satellite based). Unfortunately, it's in the middle of the eponymous ruins. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And it's been broken the entire time.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HoldYourBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HoldYourBreath">Hold Your Breath</a></em> has one of the teenagers confiscating the cell phones at the beginning of the camping trip and another dumping them during a stop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Coherence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Coherence">Coherence</a></em>, the characters are isolated in the house with no phone reception or internet, or any other way to connect or physically move to any other part of the world really. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a comet broke quantum mechanics and for a single night they can only get to other versions of their own house</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em>, Rob's cellphone battery runs out just as he is trying to call Beth after the monster attacks.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>, cell phones function perfectly right up until the plot demands they not for dramatic convenience. It seemingly has worse <em>radio</em> coverage than the original park, much less the cell reception. No wonder they needed Verizon sponsorship.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExMachina">Ex Machina</a></em>, a close-up on Caleb's phone reveals that there is no network in the area which adds to the isolation of the place.

As consequence, it's never explained why Henry couldn't have simply recorded video of Frank abusing his daughter, which is witnessed both Henry and his mother Susan repeatedly. This is likely an artifact of the screenplay being written over 20 years ago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Siren2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Siren2010">Siren (2010)</a></em>, the yacht runs aground in what seems to a black spot for cell phone reception. Later on, Rachel checks her phone and finds that the battery is completely dead. Both of these effects are implied to be a property of the island itself.

The cottage has virtually no reception but near the end of the film, Martin manages to get enough signal to call the emergency services. Unfortunately the respondent doesn't believe that the Nazi Zombie attack is real and hangs up. The others promptly chew him off for not making up a more plausible scenario.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream">Scream</a></em> where the existence of cell phones makes things <em>harder</em> for everyone. The police question <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Billy</span> because he has a cell phone and he points out "everyone has one": a chilling revelation when the murderer targets people via phones and everyone having cell phones means you can't rule potential suspects out because they were on a landline while killings happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightMovie">Midnight Movie</a></em>: Once the cinema has been sealed, everyone trapped inside finds that their cell phones no longer work.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Husk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Husk">Husk</a></em>: After their car crashes into the cornfield, none of the protagonists can get a signal on their cell phones. (Only Scott is shown trying, but it can be assumed the others did as well.) Undoubtedly a property of the curse that lies upon the field.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDriver">Big Driver</a></em>, Tess's car gets a flat tyre on a remote country road in a spot where there is no cell phone signal. Justified as the nails on the road had been laid deliberately as an ambush, and Lester had deliberately picked a spot with no reception.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsRunRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsRunRed">The Hills Run Red</a></em>, the protagonists' phones work just fine.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> book <em>New Moon</em> Edward conveniently smashes his phone in grief because he thinks Bella is dead, thus enabling a dramatic flight to Italy solely to demonstrate that she is, in fact, still alive.
<ul><li> In the first book, James <em>never</em> would have gotten away with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pretending to have kidnapped Bella's mom</span> if Renee has <em>owned a cell phone for Bella to call</em>. The movie justifies this by establishing earlier that Renee lost the cable charger for her phone, then having Bella leave her a voicemail while figuring that she lost her phone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">James also uses it to his advantage by lying that Charlie called Renee and told her that Bella was heading home, handwaving the question of why Renee just happened to be home early.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cell">Cell</a></em> by Stephen King: The people become savage and zombie-like because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">mysterious signal</a> spreading through the cellphones, so using them is automatically out of the picture if you don't want to become one of the crazies. It's never explained if the signal also affects <em>landlines</em>, however.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, <strong>HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!</strong>, deals with this problem on a regular basis. However, it's justified: due to his origin <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w9is');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0w9is" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w9is');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A hive world, aka an extremely overcrowded planet</span> he is very competent at orientation in closed spaces and thus constantly gets assigned to missions that deal with such spaces. Such as tunnels or caves. Which are, you know, underground, so it's hard to keep contact. In <em>For the Emperor</em>, for example, it was a major plot point, since he managed to find out the true reason behind the conflict and must find his way to the surface as soon as possible to prevent a large-scale war, since he can't just tell that over the radio.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em>, Crowley and two Dukes of Hell describe what they have done to aid the spread of evil that day. One Duke corrupted a politician. The other tempted a priest. Crowley disabled every cell tower in Central London for 45 minutes... during lunch hour.
<ul><li> The other demons don't understand. Crowley figures that spreading low-level frustration to thousands of people on a regular basis is much more efficient in the corruption of souls than the one-on-one approach — a thousand grouchy people spread a lot more misery around than one awful person.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>: magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">screws up advanced technology like computers and cell phones</a>, thus ruining cell phone reception whenever a wizard is around. The effect worsens exponentially when when a wizard (or other magic user) is actively casting magic, and that's not even taking into account "hexing", which is a direct magical attack with the intent of destroying technology. Dresden himself compares cell phones to a canary in a coal mine or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">those guys in the red shirts on Star Trek</a>" because they die the instant trouble hits.
</li><li> Peter Grant from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> faces a similar problem to Harry Dresden's, except that his power only trashes electronics if he actively uses magic without disconnecting their power supplies, first. In later novels, he subverts this trope by getting a phone with a cut-off switch that he only flips "on" to make a call or check his texts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickyBusiness">Tricky Business</a></em>, the villains have a jamming device activated before they board the ship so nobody's cell phone can place a distress call (and the heroine does try).

Either way, they're not used.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush">Hush, Hush</a></em>, Nora's phone <em>constantly</em> goes out while she's with Patch, even when she specifically notes she thought she charged it. She never finds this suspicious. She and Patch later end up in a motel that had its power lines knocked down in a storm, with the explanation that the motel clerk/owner simply doesn't have a cell phone because it costs too much.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Crazy City</em>, which takes place in present-day Miami. The protagonist has a cell phone, but anytime he tries to use it, he runs into problems: the people he wants to talk to are in a noisy place, or crazy, drunk, hate him, jerks, stupid, etc. The protagonist is only able to communicate with a small number of people that he has to stay close to, several of whom are beautiful underdressed women, a problem because he's in Miami <em>to get married</em> and he's desperately trying to find his lost ring.

<ul><li> Possibly further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> due to the books taking place in the 1990's, with the final book taking place in 1998, when cell phones weren't extremely wide spread and might not have had coverage in the British countryside.

This works perfectly until the truck hits a bump, and the phone breaks irreparably after <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver">falling 3 feet</a></strong>. Apparently, the future leader of the human race decided to buy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">most fragile phone on the face of the Earth</a>.
<ul><li> Can be partly explained by the fact that they come from before smartphones were a thing. The episode where Sarah meets Andy Goode, she is trying to buy cell phones for herself and John, only to be stumped by the touchscreen interface, and all of Andy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a> goes over her head.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, Mulder and Scully used cell phones fairly realistically but several times they were forced to leave a message when something urgent was to be communicated. They also often drive significant distances to speak in person rather than using their cell phones even when phoning would be perfectly safe.
<ul><li> Of course, living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">Crapsack World</a> run by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">shadow government</a> with alien technology and no accountability, Mulder really is <em>completely</em> justified in being paranoid enough to doubt that the person who answers when he calls Scully is, in fact, Scully if he can't see her face. Heck, there are episodes where he'd be advised to doubt it's Scully when he <em>can</em> see her face. For that matter, is it <em>ever</em> "perfectly safe" to use a phone to discuss a government conspiracy when elements of the FBI, NSA, and CIA are actively trying to monitor and/or block your investigation?
</li><li> Ironically, back in the day the X-Files were often mocked for their <em>excessive</em> use of cell phones; at least one contemporary parody showed Mulder and Scully talking to each other on cell phones while riding in the same car. A cell phone that folded up small enough to fit into your pocket was bleeding edge technology back in 1993 at a time when people still carried pagers. Mulder and Scully are often the only characters who even <em>have</em> cell phones.
</li></ul></li><li> Either mobile phones weren't all that popular in the USA before 2004 or the writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> chose to ignore their existence, because a good deal of the plots of many episodes would not have worked with mobile phones present. For example, the premise of the story of Joey missing the audition for Mac and Cheese. Chandler would have easily found Joey had he had a phone, though it's not unreasonable to believe that Joey, a perpetually unemployed actor, simply couldn't afford one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, Boone is shown trying to use his phone just after the crash, but he can't get reception on an island in the middle of the South Pacific.
<ul><li> Ironically, people with functional satellite phones arrive in the fourth season, but they can only call each other.
</li><li> The people currently off the island seem unwilling to call each other, preferring instead to show up in person, usually with a dramatic reveal. However, they <em>do</em> call each other when it's urgent, like when someone's life is in danger.
</li><li> Also, the Island <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">travels through time</span></em>, which can't be good for reception.
</li><li> In general the island is subject to powerful electromagnetic fields that have been manipulated by various visitors which could help explain some of the weirdness. Though its not consistent. Desmond is able to call Penelope back in England on one of the satellite phones.

On a roof. In the middle of L.A. For no reason. It would've been better if they had just left them in their coat elsewhere, or in a desk drawer, or something.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: In one episode, Marcus Cole (who doesn't wear a hand link because he's not part of the station crew) finds another person's communicator. However, he can't use it to call for help, because the communicator will only work for authorized crew members. Given that the hand link is a <em>military</em> communicator, this could be considered justified, though one would think that even a civilian (or, for that matter, Ranger) would carry at least a civilian communications device—and we never see him use one.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Marcus chose not to carry a communications device, because it draws too much attention and his responsibilities had him dealing with a lot of shady people who DON'T want that attention.
</li><li> Of course one would think even a military communicator would have a 911 equivalent given the likelihood a soldier might be incapacitated while protecting a civilian.
<ul><li> The scripts and business imply that authentication works by verifying the identity of the person touching the back panel (which when worn is molecularly bonded to the skin and hairs, explaining why Jerry Doyle's hand has been depilated). Anyone can press the call button provided they don't take it off the authorised wearer. On the other hand, that doesn't explain why the apparent use of a stolen communicator doesn't automatically summon a security patrol.
</li></ul></li><li> Babylon 5 has a fixed-line civilian videophone network (Babcom, which links to the galactic Stellarcom network) as well as the military communicators, and the videophone and communicator systems can be linked, but although portable civilian communication devices are frequently shown they are mostly used by spies and criminals (and never tapped or triangulated). All but once they are treated like walkie-talkies, and the only mobile phone shown in he series appears on Mars.

<ul><li> One episode had the group trapped in an 'spacecraft simulator' which was actually an old RV fully covered in metal. They are sealed in, the RV is being towed and they can't get cellphone reception from inside (Faraday Cage?). However, there is a short wave radio connected to an outside antenna so they can communicate with 'mission control' once they get it working.
</li><li> Subverted in a season 6 episode when the gang is in a normal RV that breaks down. Everyone is careful to keep their phones fully charged... which kills the backup battery, meaning that the heat doesn't work. They even have cell reception throughout the episode and are able to call for help, but no one will be able to get to them until the morning.
</li><li> Completely defied within Abed's made-up horror story in the episode "Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps", where the imaginary Abed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">made sure to keep his phone charged</a> and immediately calls the police (a call that goes through, is answered promptly, is believed, and the cops are instantly on their way) when he believes there is an escaped serial killer outside of the cabin he's in. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">because Abed pointedly hates</a> horror cliches which make the victims act stupid or be helpless.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a>,</em> Lois' phone runs out of batteries when something nasty is going down and she needs to make a call. She even says "Really?!" when it happens, as if disbelieving that such a cliche could happen to her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em>. Mr. Yang leaves a cell phone for Shawn as a clue. Shawn promptly throws it into a river <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to change the rules of Mr. Yang's game.</span>
<ul><li> Also in another episode, when Shawn and Gus are locked in a museum overnight, Shawn drops and breaks his cell phone after finding out a violent suspect's car is in the parking lot. Gus's cell phone battery was seen to run out earlier in the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Cell phone jammers (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> below) were part of the mid-Season 10 crackdown at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> that also brought in metal detectors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSchoolUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSchoolUniform">school uniforms</a>. Interestingly, here the writers seem to be unable to write <em>without</em> them; one scene showed Sav on a pay phone in the school, calling another character <em>who was also inside the school building at the time</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> two-part episode "20 Hours in America," Josh, Donna, and Toby get stranded at a campaign stop and can't get in touch with the rest of the staff because they're already up on Air Force One (there was also a mixup with time zones).
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> ("After Hours"), features Castle and Beckett looking for a phone for the completely legitimate reason that they'd just escaped from a couple mob hitters, who had taken their cell phones as well as their guns away. (Castle can't believe they still <em>make</em> pay phones when he finds one. Too bad the mob guys cut the pay phone's cables, too.)
</li><li> A common aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, in general. Working communicators and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashyTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashyTeleportation">transporters</a> have the potential of removing any danger from a given situation, so often one or both become unusable for some reason or another.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Disaster," many of the difficulties faced by the crew of the disabled <em>Enterprise</em> could have been avoided if their communicators were working. Partly justified in that the main computers (which link the communicators together) are down, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> kicks in when you wonder how an Away Team talks to each other when the <em>Enterprise</em> is out of range.
</li></ul></li><li> The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em> goes out of its way to avert this all the time. Part of the show's original concept was to defy the belief that modern inventions (and primarily the cell phone) had made a modern sitcom impossible.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Helix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Helix">Helix</a>,</em> which centers around a CDC team dispatched to an artic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResearchInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResearchInc">Research, Inc.</a> to deal with an outbreak of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>, the remote location of Arctic Biosystems precludes normal cell phone use. It has a state of the art satellite communication system with 10 gpbs, but it only functions for an hour each day. Then its sabotaged directly after the CDC's lead researcher decides he's lost control of the situation and states that he intends to call for backup.
</li><li> Frequently abused in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>, usually because a phone was dropped or destroyed during an alien confrontation. They have some fun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> this:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Sky:</strong> Hey! That's my phone!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Luke:</strong> Join the club. I've gone through seven phones in two years.
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E21AllHellBreaksLoosePartOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E21AllHellBreaksLoosePartOne">"All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One" (S02, Ep21)</a>, there is no reception in Cold Oak, South Dakota.
<ul><li> In Supernatural, ghosts and demons tend to interfere with electrical activity and by extension cell phone and radio reception. Indeed, one of the markers of supernatural activity is when radios and cell phones stop working or work improperly.
</li><li> Subverted in one episode where Dean notices his cellphone has no signal, so he can't inform Sam of what he's doing. It looks like a version of this trope until Sam finds a cellphone jammer in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>'s room.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>. Instead of cell phones, all Warehouse agents use Farnsworths, black-and-white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoPhone">Video Phones</a> invented by Philo Farnsworth (the inventor of TV) that work anywhere (even in the middle of nowhere, where the Warehouse is located) and can't be intercepted or traced. They still carry their personal cell phones when non-Warehouse people need to reach them, although reception inside the Warehouse is awful (possibly by design). Claudia even tries to mess with her Farnsworth to change the ringtone, which, naturally, almost leads to a disaster. Artie is adamant about her not messing with any artifact.
<ul><li> Occasionally played straight due to the fact that Myka and Pete only have one Farnsworth between the two of them, so when they split up, this trops can be played straight.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven">Haven</a></em> episode "Much Ado About Mara", none of the characters' phones work. They eventually find out a woman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">emitting microwaves</a>.
</li><li> Katy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideNo9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideNo9">Inside No. 9</a></em> episode "The Harrowing" is told that the street on which she's housesitting for a creepy family is a cell "dead zone" and she'll have to use the land line. The one time she does try to use the land line phone it's in use by a party line call.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TiereBisUntersDach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TiereBisUntersDach">Tiere bis unters Dach</a></em> episode "Höhlenangst", Chiara's phone runs out of battery, Celine admits that she's too poor to have a phone, and Greta's phone breaks when she falls down a mineshaft, all in quick succession. Naturally, they get trapped in an abandoned mine. In a later episode, Kim and Constanze both leave their phones behind when they secretly go out horse riding.
</li><li> A combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReimaginingTheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReimaginingTheArtifact">Reimagining the Artifact</a> occurred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> made-for-TV movie <em>The Beginning.</em> A prequel to the 2005 movie, but taking place in the then-modern day of 2007 (just go with it,) they made sure to include a scene where somebody mentions that cell phones don't work in Hazzard County, and everybody still communicates by CB radio, which was iconic to the original series and needed to be included somehow. Considering how rural and mountainous the Appalachian region can be, the idea of cell phones being useless in rural Georgia isn't all that ridiculous.
</li><li> Averted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>. After finding a body with no ID or phone, but a bluetooth headset, Jane uses the voice command "Call Home" to ID the victim since the phone was simply nearby and had been thrown from the body.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>: It becomes a plot point in "The Chick Chop Flick Shop" that the cell phone signal drops out a particular point in the movie studio during a storm, allowing Ronnie to be cornered by the killer as her phone call to Catherine breaks up. Of course, this was an episode that was deliberately playing with a lot of horror movie tropes.
</li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em> Shadow buys Mr. Wednesday a burner phone, but he tosses it and Shadow's phone out the window to prevent the Technical Boy from tracking them. Their "bank robbery" con might have gone more easily if Shadow hadn't needed to hang around a specific pay phone waiting for a call, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">1990s novel</a> had a fair number of chapters where they're out of communication for extended periods.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders">Midsomer Murders</a></em>: In "Hidden Depths", Barnaby and Scott get locked in a cellar where there is no cell reception.
</li><li> Done somewhat realistically in the season 3 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> as the criminals blow up the cell towers around the lab prior to their invasion of the CSI lab. It's also shown that this does not go unnoticed - reception is restored before the episode's end.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spooksville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spooksville">Spooksville</a></em> episode <em>Phone Fear</em> plays for horror, as answering a phone gets you picked off by a mysterious fog.
</li></ul>In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stag">Stag</a></em>, the lads have all put their phones in a bag in order to enjoy a weekend of hunting free of technology. Then they lose the bag. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cosmo</span> secretly hangs on to his phone, desperate for a call back about a job opportunity, but poor reception in the mountains means it's no use to anyone before the battery runs out.

Elder vampires are extremely powerful, even compared to younger vampires. But the younger one have the power of technology with them, specially when it comes to communications.

When Joshua actually <em>talks</em> to someone on his, Neku instantly turns suspicious (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joshua's talking to Hanekoma</span>).
</li><li> When the blackout hits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>, cell service goes down as well, which the characters note as odd, because the towers shouldn't be affected ("But the phone centers have their own backup power, right?

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The supposed "can you hear me now" scam was based on this: Someone calling another, seemingly at random, and — all while pretending they were in an area with fringe or otherwise poor reception — asks the caller if they can hear them. The other person replies, after which the call unexpectedly ends. According to several media outlets, the caller was actually a scam artist who was, unknown to their stooge, recording their victim saying "yes," and the fraudster, after opening bank accounts, credit cards and so forth, would run up charges on these ill-gotten accounts; many of these purchases would be made by phone, wherein a "yes" voice prompt (enacted by many companies in response to identity theft) would be required to verify and authorize a purchase. Snopes.com would later suggest the consumer advisory about the "can you hear me" scam was unproven (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/can-you-hear-me-scam/">read more here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and that, absent the scam artist having additional information at hand, there were no known cases of people being victimized by such an operation. That all said, consumers are still advised to be vigilant.
</li><li> British comedienne Jocelyn Jee Esien plays a "chav" schoolgirl who in every sketch is shown sitting on a bus screaming "CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?" into her phone, despite no one making noise near her and no obvious reason for communication failure.
<ul><li> That's eerily similar to a recurring gag from the British series <em>Trigger Happy TV</em>, where a cell phone ring would be heard before a man with a comically large phone (something the size of an old boombox) stood up and started screaming into it, usually while in a movie theatre or a restaurant.
</li><li> The central idea here is much older, and generally expressed with the phrase, "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/buzz/stories/s1266824.htm">I'M ON THE TRAIN!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"

</li><li> Despite what any communications company might say to the contrary, there are still plenty of coverage blind spots in the twenty-first century, <em>in suburbia, California</em> let alone rural areas, virgin wilderness or exotic locales. Hence faulty cells and cheap networks remain available plot devices alongside:
<ul><li> Old lithium batteries that don't hold a charge.
</li><li> Forgetting to charge one's phone in the first place.
</li><li> Small phones that get lost in sofas or down storm-drains along with keys.
</li><li> Weather effects like Midwestern US thunderstorms that blot out reception.
</li><li> Underground portions of subway/metro systems are often dead zones outside of busier stations.
</li><li> Really buggy, poorly tested interfaces, especially for multi-purpose phones.
</li><li> Poorly written applications (Java, Flash Lite, iOS, Android, etc.) that interfere with normal phone operation.
</li><li> Badly designed antennas that weaken the signal when you hold your iPhone 4 wrong.
</li><li> Phone batteries that are so sensitive to moisture that walking through a rainstorm with a phone in your pocket can fry them, let alone if they actually get immersed in water.
</li><li> Deliberately invoked in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Radio_Quiet_Zone">National Radio Quiet Zone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Virginia and West Virginia, created to reduce signal interference with the Green Bank Observatory's radio telescopes.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern smartphones make being small and thin a <em>selling point</em>. This has three consequences. Firstly, they can quite easily be dropped or fall from a pocket. Secondly, they are much easier to break than brick phones, flip phones, and even slide phones. Thirdly, one of the things that has to be slimmed down is the battery, making the phone more likely to run out of juice.
</li><li> Since cell phones rely on radio, some pieces of the trope are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. One of the first bits of information that amateur radio operators exchange is a signal report, or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RST_code">RST<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Readability, Signal, and Tone. This is very important information in poor radio conditions; skilled operators can still get the message through if they know what they're up against. "Bars" are a way to abstract this for mass-market phones.
</li><li> It's even older than THAT, according to Tom Standage's book <a class="urllink" href="https://tomstandage.wordpress.com/books/the-victorian-internet">The Victorian Internet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The introduction of the telegraph in Britain killed — among other things — the long-established "young lovers flee to Scotland to marry" trope, which was fairly common both in potboiler fiction and in real life until about the 1850's. Scotland permitted oath-marriages but England didn't, so young lovers could escape disapproving parents by taking the train to Scotland and swearing wedding vows to each other as soon as they were over the border. The telegraph gave parents the power to wire ahead and have the authorities pluck the kids off the train while they were still in England. The popular press assailed the telegraph as a "killer of romance", but how often it actually happened is open to debate.
</li><li> Also, since cell phones rely on radio, <em>they can be jammed and blocked,</em> by both natural (see above about thunderstorms) and artificial means. In fact, in many countries (though not the USA), <a class="urllink" href="http://www.phonejammer.com/home.php">cell phone jammers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can be legally purchased and used; some churches and movie theaters use them to prevent interruptions. A villain who doesn't want his victims to be able to call for help could arrange to jam his victims' phones.
<ul><li> Jamming is often set up by bomb-squads (though it's illegal in some countries), since bombs may be radio-triggered (no word on whether anyone's ever set off a bomb <em>by the jamming interrupting a signal</em>, but it'd be a hell of a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a>).
</li><li> A later form of jamming can still allow emergency calls through (operating at the level of the call-out call-in signals, rather than just jamming the frequencies), so allowing this sort of jamming would not have some of the disadvantages that jamming all signals brings, hence calls to allow it.
</li><li> A lot of schools put up cell phone jammers in an attempt to stop kids texting during class (once again, this is illegal in the USA).
</li><li> However this only applies to using true radio jammers, buildings that block coverage (intentionally or not) are still fully legal.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">Faraday cage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can severely hamper or eliminate radio (and thus cellular) communications. These doesn't have to be sophisticated or even deliberate - a metal building such as a warehouse (or the local big-box Walmart) or a metal room (elevators are the classic example) can act like one.
<ul><li> A tinfoil hat actually <em>can</em> form a Faraday cage, which means crazy conspiracy theorists are slightly less delusional than they seem. About the tinfoil. The transmitters in their heads still aren't real. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream">Or are they?</a>
</li><li> As noted in the above-linked article, for a Faraday cage to be effective it must be a closed structure with no openings larger than roughly 1/8th of the shortest wavelength it is supposed to shield against. A tinfoil hat, being very much an open structure, does not qualify. The poor reception inside metal-framed buildings is not a Faraday cage effect, it is due to such things as the metal framework creating an interference pattern in the nodes of which the signal level is greatly reduced. Conversely, in the antinodes of the pattern, the signal level is increased. In remote areas with poor reception it is sometimes possible to improve signal strength by sitting <em>inside</em> a car, in the right position to place the phone in an antinode of the pattern created by the window apertures. The behaviour of radio signals passing through metal things with holes in is not intuitive; the Faraday cage effect is only one of many related factors, and given that structures for use by humans necessarily contain holes much larger than the wavelengths used by mobile phones, it is usually of much lesser importance than other effects. (For reference, cell phone wavelengths are on the order of a foot at most. Metal-frame construction <em>can</em> effectively block the much lower frequency waves used by the AM or even FM bands, though, as anyone who's ever driven across a truss bridge while listening to the radio can tell you.)
</li><li> For a first-season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> experiment, Adam built a Faraday cage and tested it by checking his cell phone while inside. Yay, no signal!
</li></ul></li><li> Any thick wall, like cinderblock, can block cellular reception quite easily. It's also easily blocked by dirt; basements are notorious for their poor reception.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapim%C3%AD_Silent_Zone">Zona del Silencio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Durango. It's not the only one, and such areas are called "skip zones".
</li></ul></li><li> In the UK, there are still rural areas that have patchy coverage at best. The construction of new masts tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyBackYard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyBackYard">opposed in anyone's back yard</a>, especially when near a site of natural beauty, or a school. Even in more populated areas, it's possible to have to walk to the other side of a building in order to get a reception.
<ul><li> The Meteor network was notorious for this when they first started providing their service. If you lived outside of Dublin, you could generally expect to get only one bar of signal if you were lucky and this tended to go if you happened to move four inches to the left. Thankfully, this has been remedied.
<ul><li> Some foreign companies do not even provide any coverage in the UK. This means that when you are having holiday in the UK, you either have to use the telephone cells or can't call at all.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Australia the major mobile phone providers claim to provide coverage to 97% of the population, not 97% of the country. Beyond the highly populated southeast corner (between Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide) coverage is very sparse indeed. As <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/coverage-networks/our-coverage/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> map proves.
</li><li> And there are remote areas of Canada where coverage is patchy to non-existent...say, much of central Winnipeg.
</li><li> <em>Most</em> of Russia. Even populated locales and <strong>apartment houses</strong> have blind spots, travelling along major roads makes your cellphone a crapshoot, and good luck finding any network in the middle of taiga.
</li><li> Mountainous areas tend to have poor or spotty reception due to the mountains blocking the signal.
</li><li> Unfortunately too common in Brazil, where phone providers are in a deep "race to the bottom".
</li><li> During the 2013 flash-flooding in Colorado, both physical phone lines and cell towers were taken out by flood waters. Cue this trope, and a <em>lot</em> of trouble finding out who was actually in need of rescue and who was safe but couldn't call out.
<ul><li> This is a problem any time there's a natural disaster or other emergency, as even if the towers stay working on backup power and don't lose their cable or fibre-optic connection to the rest of the network<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21z23');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21z23" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21z23');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they <em>can</em> connect to other nearby towers over the air, at least in theory, but this is much slower and less reliable</span>, they only have the ability to route a certain number of calls or texts at once. When almost everyone in the area is trying to call the emergency services or their loved ones they can and regularly do become overwhelmed. This is particularly problematic in a few countries where emergency responders are starting to phase out conventional two-way radios in favour of cellphone-based systems.
</li></ul></li><li> In many places, such as the Philippines, most cellphone users can't afford post-paid phone plans use pre-paid cellphones. You 'buy' minutes for calls, texts and internet access. When you use it up, your phone is essentially useless as a communication device unless it's a smartphone and you happen to be in a wifi zone. Given that those same places tend to have crappy public wifi, this trope can generally be played straight most of the time.
</li><li> The various frequencies used by mobile providers have tradeoffs. Higher frequencies can transmit more data, but don't have the range and building penetration ability that lower frequencies have. Different providers can have vastly different performance in the same spot even if their antennas are placed on the same towers.
</li><li> Probably the Achilles' heel of smartphones are the duration of their batteries. Even with everything fancy (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiFi">Wi Fi</a>, Bluetooth, etc) turned off and using it just for making and receiving calls, you're lucky if it has guzzled the battery in a very few days even if you extend its autonomy with a powerpack. Compare this with a dumbphone whose most advanced feature may be just a VGA camera, but has juice for weeks.
</li><li> One method of getting around this problem in remote areas is to use <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_phone">satellite phones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, signal latency is high compared to mobile phones, and the technology is bulky and expensive, making them impractical for everyday use. They do, however, come in handy for emergency workers following wars and natural disasters where cellular infrastructure might have been damaged. They are also often used by pilots and people in the military, who will often find themselves in areas with no other sort of phone reception.
</li><li> In addition to the regular nuisances of phones (phone solicitation, phone scams, political calling, and wrong numbers), cellphones have the added problem of high plan price, high battery drain, and no real pay-cents-per-minute plan in US (there is "pay as you go" but such plans invariably involve paying some sort of monthly service fee which still expires after a month). If a person only uses a phone occasionally, this means they still have to turn to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-landline-phone-will-never-go-away-1530812621">landlines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ten-reasons-to-still-consider-a-basic-flip-phone-in-todays-smartphone-world/">flip phones<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or pay nearly $540 a year. Unfortunately, they are trying to phase out <a class="urllink" href="https://stopthecap.com/2013/07/08/fcc-landlines-will-only-exist-another-5-10-years-att-wants-out-by-2020/">both<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/10/05/farewell-trusty-flip-phone/16712161/">groups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of alternatives.
</li><li> The attendees at the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em> event in Chicago, Illinois, overloaded every accessible cell tower due to the large amounts of people attempting to use them playing the game, resulting in <em>nobody</em> being able to use their cell phones in the area.

<p class="_pmvv-vidbox-descTxt" id="overlay-descrip">
When Sly is tailing The Grizz, he is speaking with Le Paradox on his phone, much of it involves him having a hard time hearing him due to bad reception. Considering the phone is able to make calls through time in space by millions of years and was made using a fairly new form of science, this is understandable.	</p>
