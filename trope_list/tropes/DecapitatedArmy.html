<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, fleets tend to quickly collapse when their commanding admirals die. With no one to provide coordination between the units, chaos ensues, leaving them extra vulnerable to the enemy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the end, prisoners are freed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">people rejoice</a> when the evil overlord, in the middle of his global reign of terror, is killed by Zero, the supposedly dead freedom fighter. The kicker? The evil lord is actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">protagonist</a>, and wasn't actually evil. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Maybe</a>.
</li><li> It helps that, in this case, Lelouch's army is literally incapable of self-determination. He turns them all into mindless slaves. They have no will other than obeying his orders or that of his immediate subordinates, and they were all in on it.
</li><li> This actually happens to the Black Knights at the end of the first season as well. Given the series "Chess Motif" it's actually symbolic. When Lelouch, serving as the king <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">and the group's strategist</a>, is eliminated from the board, the rest of the group falls to pieces.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally">Code Geass: Nightmare of Nunnally</a></em>, after Charles disappears from the world as a result of Nunnally refusing to complete his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a>, the undead Knights of the Round fade from existence, as they only exist because of his power.
</li><li> Played straight and defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. The coup specifically targeted Central command's top officers to disorganize and rout the enemy forces. It worked, at least until Fuhrer Bradley revealed himself to survive the assassination attempt. Defied by the Northern Force of Briggs, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">their general</a> was taken as hostage.
<div class="indent"> <strong>General Olivier Armstrong:</strong> It seems you do not know me well, gentlemen. One of our contingency is "If the situation calls for it, leave me behind." Survival of the fittest is the iron law of Briggs, and if I bite the dust here, it just means I am not fit to live. Do not take the notion of "I have raised them" as superficial. They can work with, or <em>without</em> me, and that's what makes a Briggs soldier.
</div></li><li> The Mahora Festival arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, where thanks to an added condition in the ritual the heroes were rushing to stop, all that was needed to attain complete victory was for that arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to be defeated by Negi. This really pissed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker">Chisame</a>, since it meant that all her efforts didn't matter in the end.
<ul><li> Averted in Jack Rakan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback">Pensieve Flashback</a>, where killing Lifemaker didn't stop the end-of-the-world ritual, and it took <em>the entire fleet of three world superpowers</em> to block it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in the Land of Waves arc, where after Gato dies, his thugs plan on looting the town since he can't pay them. While the heroes don't have enough strength left to fight them off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">the arrival of the citizens of the Land of Waves</a> combined with Naruto and Kakashi making Shadow Clones forces them to retreat.
</li><li> Apparently played straight with Orochimaru and the Sound. Within days of his death, discipline and security collapsed in at least two high-security facilities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> does the "inch of his life" variety in every major arc. It often works because these are not armies, but pirate crews that work on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>. By winning, Luffy almost immediately proves that the rank and file aren't coming out on top. Specific examples:
<ul><li> Captain Axe-Hand Morgan's defeat caused his Marines to stop fighting immediately. He was an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> and they all hated him, enough to have him arrested after the fact.
</li><li> Luffy had to defeat Arlong and destroy Arlong Park in order to set the village people free. It helps that, in just a couple of attacks, the Straw Hats put his Mooks out of commission and were left with his foremen.
</li><li> The only way to stop the war in Alabasta was for Luffy to beat Crocodile and prove he's been manipulating the country this entire time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> since the rebels/soldiers/Baroque Work agents weren't going to stop for anything.
</li><li> Enel had to be defeated because, aside from his high-ranking soldiers, nobody liked him anyway.
</li><li> Rob Lucci, while only being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to Spandam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, had to be defeated by Luffy, or else he would just zoom on ahead and kill Robin. And even when Rob Lucci went down, the Straw Hats still had to make a grand escape from the Buster Call.
</li><li> Gecko Moria holds all the shadows from people around the world. Without these shadows, people die when exposed to sunlight. Once Gecko is beat up enough, he forcefully lets go all of the shadows he had collected.
</li><li> Averted with Impel Down and Marineford. Luffy isn't strong enough to beat Magellan, and nobody too high up in the Marine chain is actually defeated. The war only ends because Whitebeard, whom the Marines were really after, was killed, and Shanks popped up, who agreed he'd take on all of the Marines and pirates if things didn't stop.
</li><li> Averted in the Fishman Island arc. When Hody Jones goes down, his senior crew members go insane and just start killing everyone. They reasoned that even if they died, they could kill enough people for their legacy of hatred to persist. The Straw Hats had to beat the entire lineup and a vast portion of their 100,000-strong army to settle things. Incidentally, most of said army was human slaves and fearfully-loyal Fishmen, so they at least gave up when Hody went down.
</li><li> Capone Bege has made a hobby of this, preferring to go right for the head of organizations he doesn't approve of and assassinating them, before sitting back and watching the group flail around helplessly and collapse in the resulting power vacuum.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, Emperor Palpatine's death seems to reduce the entire Imperial starfleet to virtual catatonia. They aren't even shown retreating or regrouping; they just suddenly are gone. They had also just lost Darth Vader, the second in command, and Admiral Piett, the commander of the fleet, along with their Death Star and flagship Star Destroyer, so this was more of a complete rout.
</li><li> This was picked up on by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>, who worked a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for it into the plot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></em>. The Emperor was bolstering his forces' morale via the Dark Side, and when he died the shock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">forced the Imperials into retreat.</a> It also didn't help that the <em>Executor</em>, the most powerful vessel of the fleet and carrying all the leading personnel, was destroyed a few minutes prior.
</li><li> Despite this, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> shows that the Empire <em>didn't</em> magically cease to exist that day, even despite colossal losses. It was definitely when the tide turned, but the Empire remains a major force holding a decent amount of territory for years, and even by the time Han and Leia's kids are fully grown they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> with yet another plan to try and rise once more every so often. The massive force that ruled the whole known galaxy for so long did <em>not</em> say "well, the Emperor's dead, so I guess we'll <strong>ALL</strong> give up, go home, and just watch Oprah all day."
</li><li> Other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a> entries more or less play this straight.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> plays ping-pong with it. In the backstory, Revan's defeat and execution of Mandalore the Indomitable ended the Mandalorian War, but they were already in retreat. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Mass Shadow Generator</a> wiped out much of the rest.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>. Early in the film General Grievous immediately takes command after Dooku is slain by Anakin and the Republic is fully aware Dooku's death isn't enough to end the war. Furthermore, the Separatist forces on Utapau keep fighting even after Obi-Wan kills Grievous. Afterward, Palpatine goes as far to have Vader execute <em>all</em> the remaining Separatist leaders to ensure no loose ends.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> also shows that even after the droid-control center is destroyed, the battle droids don't shut down; instead, they default to pre-programmed orders.

Played with because the immediate battle was <em>already over</em> at that point, and had been for days. The army curb-stomped Helion Prime in a single night and the only thing Riddick actually stopped was the subsequent genocide of everyone left on the surface. Nor do the Necromongers stop their crusade for the Underverse altogether; Riddick has simply become their new leader. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick">Riddick</a></em> reveals that his brief rule is not met with approval by the Necromongers, as he has stopped virtually all conquest and refuses to make a pilgrimage to the Underverse to become a true Lord Marshall (e.g. have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> ability).

The heroes rationalize that if they take out Kasiim, his army should surrender. When they succeed, both immediately note that it should never have worked. Then the camera pans out to reveal that the rebel army showed up and surrounded Kasiim's army while they weren't paying attention.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em> has shades of this: V's plot to take down the government hinges on the assumption that the rank-and-file will become ineffective after he kills off the head of the government... and kills off all second-in-commands, and blows up a building for good measure. Not so in the original comic book, where V not only killed off the heads of government, he took over, then <strong>destroyed</strong>, their primary means of communication. No leaders, no way to keep order, and a whole lot of pissed-off people being told by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> that did it all that they can now either choose true freedom or doom themselves again.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInternational">The International</a></em>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> chairman of the evil bank flat out tells the protagonist that even if he kills him, his bank will continue its evil activities like nothing had happened. As the protagonist is pondering this, someone else shoots the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>...and during the credits, we get a montage showing that just as promised, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">the chairman was replaced and the bank kept its operations while maintaining its clean facade</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, HYDRA is an aversion, as befits an organization named after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HydraProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HydraProblem">Hydra Problem</a>. After the Red Skull was killed(?), several HYDRA agents were recruited into SHIELD and re-formed the group under their enemies' noses. Seventy years later when this was discovered by Captain America, he and his allies couldn't just kill the leader but had to dismantle SHIELD entirely in order to cripple HYDRA's activities. And even then, multiple splinter cells remain like those led by Baron Von Strucker and John Garrett.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheKing">In the Name of the King</a></em>, where the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Gallian</a> causes all the Krug to stop, turn around, and wander off, even though they were winning the battle. The Krug are actually mindless beasts, who were only turned into an army by Gallian's sorcery. After his death, they're beasts again.
<ul><li> Averted with King Konreid's death, but only because an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">Unexpected Successor</a> is found. In fact, the trope almost worked because Konreid's nephew Duke Fallow (who is in league with Gallian) would have otherwise taken the throne and ended the fight against Gallian (all the generals are sworn to obey the king, whoever it is).
</li></ul></li><li> Deconstructed In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillADragon">To Kill a Dragon</a></em>. When the Dragon is slain, his reign crumbles all right, but the resulting anarchy results in senseless violence and murder. And then the trope gets subverted for good measure when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Burgomaster</span> takes over the city.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pixels">Pixels</a></em>, beating the Donkey Kong makes the rest of the aliens retreat. Justified, as this is one of the rules of "war" the aliens have laid down before attacking.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em>, when Max reveals Furiosa has killed Immortan Joe, the younger War Boys immediately turn against Joe's remaining "sons", allowing the Citadel to fall to Furiosa's command.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a></em>, the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">East India Trading Company</a> armada turns tail as soon as the HMS <em>Endeavour</em> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lord Cutler Beckett</a>) is obliterated by the <em>Black Pearl</em> and the <em>Flying Dutchman</em>. The reason they flee is a cross between this trope and the fact that an indestructible ship crewed by immortals is now on the pirates' side.
</li><li> Averted in <em>The Sack of Rome</em> (1992). During the siege, a soldier takes out the enemy commander with an improbable shot from a cannon, then rushes to tell his prince the good news. Instead of being rewarded he's angrily dismissed by the prince, who points out that the soldier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">killed the only man he could negotiate terms with</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackTheGiantSlayer">Jack the Giant Slayer</a></em>. When Roderick gains the crown of the giants, they are beholden to serve him, so naturally killing him would make the giants not obey him anymore right? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After he is killed halfway through the movie, the crown is taken by General Fallon who becomes the new king.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The ultimate example would be the destruction of Sauron in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. Not only did his death end the war, but the frontal attack on his forces by Gandalf, Aragorn, and the others was just a diversion so Frodo could kill him. Saruman does cause trouble after his death (this was left out of the movie) but he certainly isn't a threat to all Middle-Earth, just the Shire.
<ul><li> Justified in that Sauron was using his immense power and will to bolster his orc troops. This is also what kept them from immediately turning on each other (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">en masse, at least</a>) until Sauron is destroyed. The narration also specifically mentions that the Men from the east did <em>not</em> all turn and flee, but without the support of the rest of the army, it was a relatively easy skirmish for the Gondorian forces instead of a losing battle.
</li><li> A popular joke mentions that Aragorn granted the king's forgiveness to all of Sauron's forces since fighting them would be suicide.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, Sauron helpfully knocks out his entire army with a pressure wave from his explosive death. It also has the after-effect of causing a massive earthquake that shatters the ground, collapsing his land in a neat semi-circle around the heroes and killing off about two-thirds of his army (the rest ran like hell).
</li></ul></li><li> And note that this is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, where the Orc/Warg army at the Battle of Five Armies is certainly somewhat discomforted when Beorn manages to kill their leader Bolg but does not immediately crumble. This is because those Orcs were acting under their own will and not that of Sauron. This is also emphasised in the early chapters of <em>The Two Towers</em> when other Northern Orcs do not get along with the Mordor-orcs under Sauron's direct control (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Uruk-hai</a> under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Saruman's</a> control don't get along with either side).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, the Dwarven contingent of the Union of Maedhros abruptly leaves the battle after their King is killed injuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>.
<ul><li> That is a downplayed example. They make a fighting retreat and the wounding of Glaurang impresses Morgoth's army so much that no one dares interfere.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>, this is both played straight and subverted.
<ul><li> It's played straight at Vo Mimbre, 500 years prior to the series, because it's a case of combat by champion, with the good guys having goaded Kal Torak out to fight. Since Torak is the bad guys' <em>God</em>, him going down was a serious knock to their confidence - plus, like Sauron, he was holding the various factions of his people, the Angaraks, together (not through magical power, mind you, just because they were terrified of him - when a couple of his armies were far enough away for him to be unable to interfere, they promptly tried to kill each other). The army promptly disintegrates, though the battle carries on, as the Alorns (the main part of the Western alliance) are conducting a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> for the genocide of one of their member states earlier in the campaign.
</li><li> It's also played straight in the first series, with this being the heroes' entire strategy, since the Angaraks have the Western nations far outnumbered, and the invasion is, again, driven by Torak. However, afterwards, 'Zakath, Emperor of Mallorea, still retains ambitions to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, calling himself Kal Zakath (though apparently, the latter wasn't so much a declaration of megalomania as a political move suggested by his bureaucracy. Even his attempts at world-domination are more or less because he's a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a> and power is all that satisfies him. Well, that and his cat.)
<ul><li> On a micro-level, the Murgo army collapses somewhat at Thull Mardu after their King, Taur Urgas, is killed in a duel with the Algar King, Cho-Hag, for similar reasons - he was crazy, but his crazy made his army feel invincible. They still fought on, but fragmented.
</li></ul></li><li> Also subverted in the second series, with the mooted plan by Agachak and the reluctant Murgo King, Urgit, to defeat the Malloreans being by assassinating 'Zakath. While the campaign against the Murgos is driven entirely by 'Zakath's need for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a>, it's pointed out by 'Zakath himself that if his generals even <em>thought</em> there might be a hint of foul play going on, they'd spend the next couple of generations obliterating the Murgos.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> partially has this. When Voldemort was defeated the first time, his organisation immediately crumbled. However, it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlySmallOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlySmallOrganization">Oddly Small Organization</a> and it is implied that there was a lot of chaos, what with arresting Death Eaters and figuring out who was forced into it or enchanted or what. Also, Voldemort had been on his own and operating under his own agenda, so his supporters would most likely have been separated and taken by surprise. The end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em> averts this, as pretty much every Death Eater was either dead, incapacitated or had done a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> by the time Voldemort dies.
<ul><li> Voldemort tries the trope himself late in <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, where he thinks "killing" Harry will stop the Hogwarts rebellion. It doesn't work, even well before Harry reveals that he's alive.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series. Pick a book, any book. Somewhat justified in that the mooks of choice, the rats, are uniformly idiotic to the point of being comic relief save for the occasional brutal, charismatic leader who turns them into a threat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Vorbis, leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> (to whom the protagonists belong), starts a war with pretty much every other nation on the planet. He gets killed by a turtle (it's a long story) and the hero brings his body to the battlefield to try and convince the other nations not to attack. Their response? They've put too much effort into preparing for war to stop and <em>not</em> attack. After all, they've come all this way. The overall message is that war is bigger than any one man, even if that one man was mostly responsible for all the crap that happened in the first place. (Luckily the Great God Om bullies everyone else's gods into telling them to call the war off, and <em>that</em> gets their attention.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>, Vimes encounters a desert tribe and attempts to capture their leader to force surrender... which makes them charge even faster since they believe that any leader stupid enough to be captured so easily isn't worth following.
</li><li> Explored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>. Vimes and Carcer are whisked back out of time, leaving their armies behind. In the words of Havelock Vetinari, who was there and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">caught up the long way around</a>, Carcer's men quailed when he was gone. Vimes's men? They tore the enemy apart when they saw he was down.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodAngels">Blood Angels</a> novel <em>Deus Sanguinius</em>, when Rafen proclaims Arkio's death and shows them the body it doesn't end the battle, but the Blood Angels who had fought on Arkio's side switch to supporting their brothers.
</li><li> One of Stephen Lawhead's books in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PendragonCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PendragonCycle">Pendragon Cycle</a></em> averted this in regards to the Saecsens. The narrator mentions that killing the leader is a <em>bad</em> idea, as his subordinates will then fight to the last man to avenge him. Capturing him alive, however, kills their will to fight.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines">Ultramarines</a> novel <em>Dead Sky, Black Sun</em>, Honsou's killing one of the opposing generals gives him the chance to talk. He has to point out that they have fought and died while the other general lurked behind to win his followers' support.
</li><li> Justified at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Eragon</a></em>: Durza tricked and mentally enslaved the Urgals, which was why they were fighting. In reality, the Urgals were not particularly good at fighting together when not mind-controlled, because Durza had enslaved Urgals from a number of <em>different clans</em>, a good number of which were at war or otherwise on bad terms with the others. So when Durza dies they are freed, and promptly panic or turn on each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>, immediately after Nessarose is killed, apparently all of Munchkinland seemed to be driven into total disarray, and pure chaos in the streets.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novel <em>Duty Calls</em>. The antagonist of the book is a Chaos Warmaster with an army of encharmed slaves. Cain tricks him into a duel and kills him. He then half-hopes that this will cause all the enslaved people to come to their senses but in his heart, he knows that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">this only happens in fairy tales</a>". And indeed, Chaos forces are just enraged by the loss of their idol and attack ferociously.
<ul><li> Played straight earlier in <em>Death or Glory</em>, where Cain killing the Ork Warboss Korbul causes the Orks to fracture into competing warbands and scatter within hours.
<ul><li> Though, as pointed out further down in the Table Top section, when the old Ork Warlord dies the Orks often begin to fight each other in order to establish a new leader.
</li><li> Nobz that accompanied the warboss tried this, even ignoring the Cain himself (their dialogue isn't translated, but essentially they all tried to order the others to get him, and then all of them were pissed off about somebody trying to give them orders...). Fortunately, the reinforcements arrived and killed all of them.
</li></ul></li><li> It's also mentioned on the good guys side in <em>The Traitor's Hand</em> where it's mentioned that protocol states that the two senior officers of an army can never take the same dropship down during a deployment (unless something was extremely wrong) as the enemy would only need one lucky shot in order to invoke this trope.
</li><li> "Traitor's Gambit" defies and plays this trope straight at the same time. While talking with enemies Cain himself ridicules the assassination attempt since the chain of command means that if general will be killed the next senior officer will replace him without any loss in combat effectiveness. Amberley notes that while IG task force could remain operational despite general's demise, it surely will inflict a heavy blow on the troops' morale. Not to mention the fact that lord general was a gifted tactician. Subverted in that the enemy leader didn't actually expect it to work; she was pulling a Hans Greuber and the attack was little more than cover for a robbery.
</li><li> Cain is rather surprised when said lord general claims that <em>Cain's</em> death would have a similar effect. Cain is just a Commissar after all. However, his heroic reputation is so great that his death would crush the troops' morale even more than the general's death.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHourOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHourOfTheDragon">The Hour of the Dragon</a></em>, Amalric's death causes his army to break.
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeyondTheBlackRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeyondTheBlackRiver">Beyond the Black River</a>", the Picts retreat when Zogar Sag dies.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletCitadel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletCitadel">The Scarlet Citadel</a>", Conan's own troops turn to other strong nobles when rumored that their king is dead. Conan wins them back exactly the same way. The Aquilonians even have a proverb that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this trope:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em> 'The sword that slays the king cuts the cords of the empire.' </em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil">Malevil</a></em>, this is used as the plan of attack near the end of the novel. The villain is marching his army toward the hero's castle, he rules his conscripts with fear, and bad luck has cost him his two best lieutenants. If they can kill him and his last second-in-command then his army should disband. They have to succeed because while he can't take the castle in a single battle, they won't be able to win a prolonged guerrilla war against him.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> novel <em>Necropolis</em> ends with Gaunt killing Heritor Asphodel and crippling his forces in the process. Justified by the Zoicans being controlled by a signal he was continually broadcasting.
</li><li> Julie Sims manages to wound Wallenstein in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1632</a></em>, causing confusion that leads to his army being defeated. This is a point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> as down-timers consider it bad manners to mark leaders whereas up-timers say they are responsible for the war in the first place and should be sought out.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anabasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anabasis">Anabasis</a></em>. When the prince the Greek mercenaries are fighting for is dead the war is over and there is nothing to do but march home. However, during the negotiations with the Greek mercenaries, the Persian king assassinates the Greek officers. The Greeks simply elect new ones and march home.

</li><li> Downplayed but still played mostly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising">Red Storm Rising</a></em> during the Soviet invasion of Iceland. A direct missile hit on the command centre didn't stop local forces from <em>fighting</em>, but with nobody giving orders above company and platoon level the defence turned into a disorganised mess that the Russians quickly overcame.
</li><li> Done or attempted several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>.
<ul><li> Jaime Lannister sees that he's losing the Battle of the Whispering Wood, and rallies his guard and charges straight for Robb. While this wouldn't have entirely solved the problem, it would have put Brandon, a crippled child, as the current leader of the Starks, significantly reducing their threat. Robb's bodyguards manage to stop him.
</li><li> While besieging Riverrun, it's suggested that they try to kill Brynden Tully with poisoned arrows, assuming that whoever replaces him won't be so stubborn and will yield the castle. Jaime instead releases their prisoner Edmure Tully. Edmure outranks Brynden, and once he's in charge he yields it.
</li><li> In the battle for Astapor the Astapori break once their leader goes down. Their leader was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy">corpse</a>, so you can see their starting position wasn't very strong.
</li><li> The many tribes that compose wildling army are kept together only by Mance Rayder, and several suggestions are made on ways for the grossly outnumbered Night's Watch to kill him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately Stannis comes to their aid, routs the wildlings, and Mance is taken prisoner.</span>
</li><li> Robert had a habit of personally killing enemy commanders. Randyll Tarly almost does this to him, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Robert</a> sees it coming and has his men retreat in good order, turning what could have been a major decisive victory for the Targaryen loyalists into a minor and inconclusive victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfDunkAndEgg">The Sworn Sword</a></em>. When Ser Duncan and his lord Ser Eustace ride out alone to confront the vastly superior forces of Lady Rohanne, Ser Eustace suggests this trope as the only possible way of winning. Dunk is noncommittal as he's come to admire Lady Rohanne and tries persuasion instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Exaggerated in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> with the Vord, who despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Horde of Alien Locusts</a> do not naturally follow a eusocial hive structure, and if not directly under psychic control from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Hive Queen</a> revert to individualistic animals who don't mass against humans and might even attack one another. It's also downplayed in the finale, as even after the final Queen is eliminated, the amassed Vord continue to attack the main Aleran defenses, simply because there are millions of them concentrated in one area and most have no choice but to continue moving forward into the defenders.
<ul><li> Downplayed earlier in the series with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Canim</a> invasion. Killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Sarl</a>, their leader, turns the tide of a single battle and drives his faction into such disarray that they lose control of the army, but it does not end the invasion as a whole. Sarl gets replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">Nasaug</a>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">more competent</a>, but also more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">honorable</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">reasonable</a>, and his influence means war can be ultimately ended peacefully a book later.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, after Firestar kills Scourge, the leader of BloodClan, one of the BloodClan cats notices and yowls that Scourge is dead. The fight goes out of all the BloodClan cats and they flee, pursued all the way to the edge of Clan territory by WindClan, just to add insult to injury.
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathLands">Death Lands</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian">hardline communist faction</a> tries to decapitate the entire US political and military command structure by detonating three briefcase nukes during the Presidential inauguration, as a preliminary to a surprise nuclear attack. Unfortunately, their intelligence on US command and control is flawed, as there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> in an airborne command center who's secretly acquired the launch codes for just such a scenario. The resulting nuclear, chemical and biological conflagration turns Earth into the equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStainlessSteelRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStainlessSteelRat">The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You</a></em>, where one of the aliens' first acts is to attack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation">Space Station</a> that is hosting a gathering of humanity's top military brass. With all the top commanding officers in enemy hands, their immediate subordinates take over their duties... and vastly increase the military's effectiveness.
<ul><li> This one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, as the brass has been replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">non-commissioned officers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDinosaurLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDinosaurLords">The Dinosaur Lords</a></em>, as most of Raguel's horde is mind-controlled by him, when he falls, they regain their minds and are horrified by what they were doing, instantly surrendering to the Empire.
</li><li> In the Cross-Time Engineer novel <em>The Flying Warlord</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski">Leo Frankowski</a>, Conrad Stargard sends in a commando force who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">somehow identify and kill every commander in the Mongol forces in the middle of the night</a>. This is used to explain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> later when the Mongols ride straight into the trap set by Stargard's forces. Given that an army of nomad warriors who had already conquered large parts of Asia and Eastern Europe would be used to taking casualties and have no shortage of combat-experienced soldiers adept at taking the initiative, this is rather implausible.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Hard Rain</em> by Barry Eisler. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnRain">John Rain</a> is asked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce">Tatsu</a> to assassinate a yakuza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a>. It's a high-risk job, so Rain asks why he shouldn't go after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> instead. Tatsu argues that a) the boss in question is well guarded and a public figure, and b) there are plenty of potential bosses waiting to fill his shoes. Being a boss requires traits like greed, political skill and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">talent for rationalization</a> — which are hardly uncommon, unlike the specialist skills needed by a good hitman, who can't be easily replaced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar">The Dogs of War</a></em>. During the planning for the coup to depose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">President Kimba</a>, the mercenary Shannon stresses the importance of killing Kimba due to the belief among his followers that he has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juju">juju<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that protects him from harm. Whoever kills Kimba will be assumed to have more powerful juju, making his ability to run the country much easier. Furthermore, Kimba is so paranoid about a coup that he concentrates the only effective firearms in his own palace along with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>, so Shannon just plans a direct assault on the palace and kills everyone in it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundrySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundrySeries">The Nightmare Stacks</a></em>. The invading army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">alfar</a> from an alternate universe attempt a coup de main to kill the rulers of Great Britain and assume their places in the hierarchy. Not only do they make the mistake of assuming that this Earth is controlled by magic just as there's is, they're also attacking the wrong place (the Laundry regional headquarters at Leeds instead of London). At the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cassie and Alex end up doing exactly the same thing in reverse, defeating the invasion by killing the All-Highest and his current wife in order to make Cassie the new All-Highest. She then just orders her army to surrender and seek refugee status.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtsOfDarkAndLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtsOfDarkAndLight">The Arts of Dark and Light</a></em>, the seven-year Siege of Iron Mountain was finally broken when, through a desperate gambit, Lord Hammerstone managed to exfiltrate a commando team who killed the Troll King in a surprise attack. This then caused the besieging army to dissolve, as each of his warlords scrambled to seize a portion of the kingdom for himself.

<ul><li> Renly's assassination splits his army down the middle, with half his men going over to Stannis and the other half fleeing with Loras Tyrell.
</li><li> After Rickard Karstark is executed, his forces break off from the rest of the army and withdraw from the war.
</li><li> The commanders of the Second Sons obviously expect this when they decide on assassination instead of risking a battle against 8,000 Unsullied.
</li><li> The Stark army is quickly surprised and massacred following the assassination of their leader, which was Tywin's winning move in the War of the Five Kings. Given Stannis' determination, it's not as decisive as he expects.
</li><li> Jon reasons that if they can kill Mance Rayder, they can stop Mance's attack on the Wall since Mance's army of wildlings will collapse back into their traditional rivalries. His reasoning is pretty solid, but his plan is less so and he knows it.
</li><li> The Lannister family owe most of their power and influence to Tywin alone. Ser Davos and Lord Baelish remark that with Tywin and the sheer power of his will gone, all that remains is Jaime, a one-handed, untrustworthy and isolated man, Tommen, a soft King, and Cersei, an unpopular former Queen whose power diminishes every day in favour of Margaery's.
</li></ul></li><li> In the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life">Life</a></em>, Charlie Crews is in a car with Roman and his hired goons, being driven off to an uncertain, but likely unpleasant, fate. In his ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>, Charlie takes Roman out with a jab to the throat, and the goons barely react as Roman chokes to death. Then Charlie informs them that whatever hold Roman had over them is gone now, and they can just go their separate ways— and awesomely ends his whole speech with, "Do you guys understand English?"

A couple of months after the final battle, the Gokaigers read about the Empire's descent into factionalism and decide their next adventure will be on the Zangyack's home turf.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> uses this in the season 7 finale: when the Leviathans' leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Dick Roman</a> is killed by Dean and Castiel, Crowley comments that they won't be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>-level threat anymore, since Roman's been their leader since basically the dawn of time and losing him will throw them into confusion.

</li><li> The situation is inverted during the battle of Foyles. Winters has been promoted and Lt Dike, the new commander of Easy Company, is incompetent and paralyzed with indecision. This results in the attack bogging down and the soldiers are about to rout when Dike is dismissed from command. With a replacement commander, the soldiers rally and take the town.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> where Weston asks the smuggler leader he was trying to save at the time what he thinks his men will do when the person cutting their paychecks is killed off.

</li><li> Subverted when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Ori</a> are all killed partway through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>, but their followers are unaware and continue the war in the Ori's name, and must be dealt with separately. It is mentioned that the "Flames of Celestis" (the Doci's connection to the Ori) went out when the Ori died and this has the Priors concerned, but they've elected not to share this with the masses. The wrap-up film reveals that, with the deaths of all the Ori, the ascended Adria is now in charge of all their followers. Additionally, the trope is inverted in the film. It's <em>Adria</em> that can't be defeated until she loses all her followers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight in one episode of where Master Vile puts together a small army of monsters under the command of his general, Professor Longnose. After engaging the Alien Rangers, the heroes are able to strike Longnose down, and the rest of the army retreats.
</li><li> Averted in the earlier three-part episode featuring Rita and Zedd's wedding. The Rangers face a large force of monsters here, who do <em>not</em> give up until <em>all</em> of them are beaten. The heroes manage to do so anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Super Megaforce</a></em> as the team is able to defeat Emperor Mavro and, with his dying words, declares that they won't defeat his army.

<ul><li> Downplayed in the <em>Weapons &amp; Warriors</em> game. The army doesn't lose if the general falls, but you lose one of your dices, cutting your movement in half.
</li><li> In the 5th Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, killing the general not only cost your opponent a powerful hero and all the General-related benefits but actually caused every enemy unit to test for Panic, possibly causing the entire enemy army to run for the hills. Nowadays, this only affects Undead armies, who start to fall apart because the necromancer is no longer animating them and because they have fewer General-related benefits, though killing the enemy general is still a victory condition in certain scenarios.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> uses this more in the background material than in game mechanics:
<ul><li> Orks (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>'s Orcs) are normally in a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> until some powerful Warboss gathers them into a WAAAGH!, and if he dies his army tends to dissolve into its component tribes and clans as his would-be heirs compete to take over. This doesn't mean that the Orks will stop fighting their original enemy, though, it just means that the enemy is dealing with dozens of competing warbands instead of a united horde.
</li><li> Followers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos</a> can be even more fractious than Greenskins, so killing their leader may simply result in a brief pause as a new leader asserts themselves, drive them to eat each other (maybe literally), or fight on even harder.
</li><li> Played mostly straight with the Tau Ethereals, the members of the guiding caste who, it is implied, use a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> to make sure Tau society <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">works the way it does</a>.

</li><li> Tyranids are the major instance of this being both a fluff and in-game trope. The 'nids rely on their synapse creatures to keep the overall connection to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> intact and keep their forces organized. When synapse is lost, Tyranids revert to pure animalistic behavior and are much easier to fight. On the tabletop, when synapse creatures are destroyed any Tyranids that are out of synapse suffer penalties to their stats and can even turn on themselves or their fellow 'nids.
</li><li> Going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">straight for the enemy command structure</a> was a trademark tactic of Warmaster Horus Lupercal, Primarch of the Sons of Horus and leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a>. When the Siege of Terra was dragging on and loyalist reinforcements were getting closer, Horus lowered the shields of his flagship to tempt the Emperor to try the same approach with a teleportation attack. Ironically, Horus was killed in the duel and his own legion fell victim to this trope, fleeing with his body and leading the retreat.
</li><li> Averted in regards to the Alpha Legion. Players have to select a character model to lead their forces, which is called their warlord, and they get to pick a bonus to represent that model's leadership skills. The Alpha Legion can choose to a take a random bonus... but unlike any other faction, when the warlord is killed another model can take its place (and still gets a bonus!). To kill the warlord at that point, the enemy has wipe out every single character model.

In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em> back-story, had Michael defeated Lucifer before the War of Wrath began, the Rebellion would have been stopped. He couldn't. Much later, when the Fallen were cast into the Abyss, God made damn sure Lucifer wasn't with them, going as far as to let him go free (even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower">depowered</a>) because, in his presence, other Demons would have endured ANY imprisonment.
</li><li> Not quite averted, but explored in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> module "Red Hand of Doom." Defeating the end boss does <em>not</em> decapitate the army. There's a percentage chance that one of his lieutenants is able to take control. The percentage decreases the more lieutenants you killed leading up to defeating the end boss.
</li><li> The almost universally known example is, of course, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em>.

Each force is led by a commander, whose death means defeat no matter how many minions he has left. These units can still act if there are allied leaders however, but defeating all leaders is the most common way to win a scenario.

Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">bosses</a>' adds disappear when they're defeated, but there are some subversions, such as Sartharion (whose adds often kill the players after they defeat him with the drakes still alive), Herod (who causes an army of very weak Scarlet Trainees to rush the party after he dies), and Instructor Razuvious (whose Understudies are still alive, but get a damage increasing debuff that enables you to kill them very quickly).
</li><li> <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> is a subversion and a justified use of this trope. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Arthas Menethil</a> is killed, the heroes learn that without a Lich King the undead Scourge will run out of control, becoming more dangerous than before. Bolvar Fordragon then takes up the Helm of Domination to become the new Lich King and order the Scourge to stand down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> have similar conditions as the standard, with the added caveat that a destroyed Commander/ACU goes up like a nuclear bomb, typically taking out the rest of their army/base anyway. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the fact that they're the literal brains of the operation, and serve as the Avatar for the player. Every other unit is just a machine controlled by the commander, and have no direction upon his death. Skirmish and multiplayer games can be set to allow the player to continue if they still have other forces remaining.
<ul><li> In <em>Total Annihilation</em>, this sometimes leads to 'combombing', where a player will deliberately position their commander in the centre of an opponent's base- typically early in a game, when the resulting explosion will do more damage than anything else currently available could, wiping out most or all of the opponent's forces and infrastructure. Naturally, this only works if the option to fight on is enabled, otherwise this will result in either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">Mutual Kill</a> or an instant loss.
<ul><li> On the other end of the morality spectrum was the other version of 'combombing', which involved flying in a rapidly built transport plane to pick up the enemy commander, and then self-destruct the plane. Units without hilariously massive amounts of health would not survive. If the option not to fight on is enabled, it's an instant win. If it is, the bomber would usually try to position the commander in the most harmful position possible, to win quickly. Naturally, players frowned on this. Fortunately, the AI was just as vulnerable to it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> games, a general's death on the battlefield causes the rest of his army to take a morale hit, increasing the odds it will rout. And on the strategic level, wiping out a faction leader and all of his heirs, through battle and/or assassination, will cause that faction to collapse and join the generic "rebels" faction no matter how large and powerful it was.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar">Medieval</a></em> games peasant uprisings are particularly prone to this, being mostly made up of peasants with terrible morale. So long as the rebel captain isn't part of a unit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiCavalry">spearmen</a>, one 20-man unit of knights can rout an army of a thousand peasants with one good charge.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em>, this is the bane of crusader armies. Joining a crusade makes an army move faster, reduces its upkeep, and allows the recruitment of zealous religious mercenaries, but it's the character leading that army that joined the crusade, not the army itself. If said character dies and there isn't another noble to take over and take up the cross, the crusading army will disintegrate in just a few turns on the strategic map.
</li><li> Averted to a degree from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire</a></em> onwards. Killing generals on the battlefield would not necessarily stop enemies (especially veteran units) from retreating that easily, while in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2">Shogun 2</a></em>, assassinating the daimyo and his heirs only serves to hand power over to said daimyo's wife. Also, in <em>Empire</em>, actual government leaders are never present on the battlefield. They are also not characters on the map, so they can't be assassinated either. They can still die due to age or random event, but there is always someone to take their place. In fact, under a democracy, presidents are periodically subject to re-election.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer">Warhammer</a></em>. The Undead factions are dependent on the presence of the general, and if the general is killed its only a matter of time before the rest of the army crumbles. However, the rest of the factions follow the previous examples, with the armies taken hit to morale, but not immediately retreating.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em>, twice. First in Protoss Mission 2, "Into the Flames", Tassadar destroys a Cerebrate in hopes it will disable (or at least disorganize) the forces it controls. It does neither. Then in the finale, the Protoss with help from the Terrans go after the Overmind itself, figuring this should render the Zerg swarm helpless. Cue the expansion: <em>Brood War.</em>
<ul><li> The subversion is justified in-game; if a Cerebrate is killed, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Overmind</a> simply makes a new one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathisaSlapontheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathisaSlapontheWrist">with all the memories and experience of the old Cerebrate still intact</a>. Finding a way <em>permanently</em> kill these Cerebrates and successfully apply this trope is a crucial plot point.
</li><li> Played straight whenever a vital Zerg controller is successfully destroyed; Any Zerg that entity was controlling will go berserk and massacre anything near it, including fellow Zerg. This is a BIG DEAL for the Zerg if said entity was responsible for <em>their entire species</em>. To their credit, both the original Zerg Overmind <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later Kerrigan</span> created "backup controllers", that would salvage small portions of the swarm in case that happened.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cleaning up the devastating aftermath of this trope is a major theme in the <em>Heart Of The Swarm</em> expansion.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In several battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShiningSeries">Shining Series</a></em>, killing the resident (minor) boss enemy will instantly cause every other enemy on the field to drop dead. Also applicable to your team in most games, where the death of the leader's character is an automatic total defeat.
</li><li> An example of this is seen frequently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat Em Ups</a>, where if you defeat the final boss of a stage while he still has Mooks on screen, all of them spontaneously and simultaneously die.
</li><li> Thankfully played straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nowel's</a> scenario in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena">Magical Battle Arena</a></em>, where all you have to do to beat the combined forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Ruru</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Kirara, Sarara</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Nanoha, and Fate</a> in her final stage is to take out Ruru.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em> series has the Regicide game mode, where the death of a player's king would cause them to lose, and all their units surrender.
<ul><li> Inverted in every campaign where you manage an historical figure (like Joan d'Arc or Genghis Khan) as a hero unit. Their death is an instant loss condition.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em> and its variants, this is both averted and played straight. Averted when it comes to the enemy leader and played straight when it comes to your army.
</li><li> Both played straight and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>. Some missions end immediately after you defeat the opposing army's commander, while in others the enemy will continue fighting even after you kill the boss until you complete another objective, like wiping out the enemy to a man, surviving for a given number of turns, or occupying the tile the boss was sitting on. It's entirely possible (and annoying) in one of these missions for your lord unit to kill the boss only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">finished off by a bunch of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">next turn</a>.
<ul><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em>. Just about every stage sans the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is a "Rout" mission, so enemies will <em>still</em> fight to the last man even when their commander is down. Yet the map where you fight Rudolf is an assassination map - before it starts, Rudolf will tell his men that if any of them are left standing once he falls, they are to lay down their weapons and surrender. Naturally, when Rudolf is defeated, the map ends no matter how many enemies are left standing - because they all surrendered.
</li><li> A plot-based version occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>; it's not clear <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just how many of Sigurd's army dies at the Battle of Belhalla (in fact, it's entirely possible that most of them survived), but with Sigurd dead</span>, they end up scattering to the winds rather than try to renew the fight, claim their inheritances, or clear their names.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> is good with this trope. Played straight in the first where the orcs win after King Llane is murdered by Garona. Invoked by Orgrim Doomhammer in the second when he killed Lothar, but subverted as it only makes the Alliance angrier and the Horde lost the battle. Averted in the third when Arthas killed Mal'Ganis (because he was not the <em>real</em> leader of the Scourge) but played straight with the death of Archimonde.
<ul><li> Llane himself frequently stated that "as long as a strong heart was on the throne, the men's morale would not falter." It's possible that Stormwind would have held if Llane survived.
</li><li> According to the lore, Orgrim's gambit nearly worked, as the Alliance forces were on the bring of routing after Lothar's death. It was only thanks to Turalyon picking up Lothar's broken sword and knocking out Orgrim that the tide was turned. And even that only happened because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">Orgrim shot his mouth off</a> and told Turalyon that orcs weren't native to Azeroth (Turalyon was being tormented by a crisis of the faith at the time). After that battle, and with Orgrim captured, the Horde was in full retreat. It worked in the long run, though, as Lothar was the only one who held the Alliance together, and it quickly went to hell after the end of the war.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Rambo</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame">Light Gun Game</a> uses this in a minor way: whenever there's an "officer" among the enemies, killing him first will startle some of the soldiers on-screen, which will not attack for a few seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> subverts this <em>twice</em>. Killing off Elite Krotera doesn't stop the Tasen's dominion as they're on the brink of extinction and they'll fight back at anything to the last man. Near the end, Komato General Tor discusses this trope with Iji as he reminds her he's just one general in their immense army and that if he goes down, another general will give the command to obliterate Earth. And anyway, he already gave the order and only a word from him will stop the final attack. Only beating the crap out of him (without killing him) convinces him to call it off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> II</em> does this in Act 3. When you kill the high council the Zakarumites will no longer attack you and flee in fear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> tries to invoke the trope but fails. When Bastila leads a few Jedi to board and cripple Darth Revan's flag ship and capture the man himself, his apprentice takes this as a good reason to have his vessels fire on said flag ship's bridge and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">usurp the leadership of the Sith empire</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>. Revan managed to survive (long story) and amasses a cult. Taking down the now-insane Revan does end the cult's plans and leave it in disarray, playing it straight. There's also Vitiate, who zig-zaggs it. Sure, the Sith Empire is pretty much imploding by the time the Makeb arc rolls around, due to a combination of bad military policy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>, Darth Malgus's rebellion, and the deaths of several Dark Council members in addition to the Jedi Knight taking out the Emperor. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> when it turns out that the Knight was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow">Fighting a Shadow</a> and Darth Marr takes command of the Empire with intent on correcting its fatal flaws.

Killing the enemy commander results in instant victory for your side, even if you and your commander are the only ones still alive.
<ul><li> Simultaneously subverted. When you kill an enemy officer, the soldiers in his unit keep fighting... unless they're too busy running away in fear.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance">Resistance</a>: Fall of Man</em>, the deaths of the Angels at the end of the game causes the rest of the Chimera to die off once they lose their psychic contact with their Angel controllers. However, they come back in the sequel after the emergence of a new Angel/human hybrid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Daedalus</a>.

While killing the leader in of itself does not kill all the rest, it does prevent that gang from returning, and the leader is usually one of the last to spawn anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> has the "Assassinate" victory condition, where killing the enemy commander is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>.

Deliciously subverted with the Orks however, as Gorgutz not only manages to escape but <em>detonates his entire stronghold</em> as he leaves, just because.
</li></ul></li><li> This seems to occur at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, with the death of the Nihilanth ending the threat of its army. The ending of the expansion <em>Opposing Force</em> however shows that it was really a thermonuclear warhead <em>obliterating the entire facility</em> that ended the invasion, the Xen army not able to teleport to any other location on Earth. (The game's relevance to continuity is dubious, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed the validity of the ending.)

However, this is also simultaneously averted: Lanius is second-in-command of the Legion after Caesar. Regardless of whether or not you're gunning for the Legion, killing Caesar himself has basically no effect on the end battle, although it is stated that Caesar himself is essential to the Legion's survival as a whole, as he's the personality the Legion is built around and without him it will fracture.
</li><li> After the Master's death in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em>, most of the surviving first-generation Super Mutants emigrated east, settling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Broken Hills</a>, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Jacobstown</a>. Since they and most other remnants of the Master's Army have no interest in continuing their former mission, this trope is pretty much played straight.
</li><li> Subverted by the Enclave from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. In spite of losing at least four major headquarters and having their entire upper echelon of leaders gutted at least twice, the Enclave has managed to regroup and recover from their losses almost every single time. Only time will tell if the Enclave has finally been defeated once and for all, after the destruction of their headquarters at Adams Air Force Base in <em>Broken Steel</em>.

If you declare war on an enemy king, quickly defeat him and conquer his provinces, you can force him to hand over his titles to you. All of his vassals will then become yours, and any that had taken arms to defend their former liege will cease hostilities. On easier settings, this means that you can conquer the totality (or almost) of the map with relative ease. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKingsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKingsII">Crusader Kings II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKingsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKingsIII">Crusader Kings III</a></em> added various difficulties that make this much harder to pull off<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0u9iv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0u9iv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0u9iv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the second game, vassals <em>don't</em> like new lieges, and if you take over a large enough territory, they <em>will</em> rise up against you as soon as they can. In the third game, this is still true, with the added problem that newly-conquered territories are not under your control, and <em>bringing</em> them under your control takes years, possibly <em>a decade</em>, during which they are potentially rebellious and <em>definitely</em> a drain on your resources</span>.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> after defeating Giygas, in that he was the source of all the enemies' evil thoughts.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordMonarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordMonarch">Lord Monarch</a></em>, if king is defeated by other player, all his units and houses will defect to side who killed him and all golds are transfered to victor's possesion. If killed by monsters or from exhaustion, all units and houses will disappear.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordsOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordsOfMagic">Lords of Magic</a></em>: Defeating an enemy lord removes their faction from the game, and the game ends when only one lord's faction remains. However, if two lords ally together and one is defeated, the surviving lord takes control of the defeated lord's faction, and if a lord dies without allies, their soldiers become neutral wandering bandits and swear to avenge themselves against the lord who defeated them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, when the Archdemon is killed, the Darkspawn all turn and flee. Justified in that he's mindlinked to them: the Darkspawn Chronicles DLC, in which you play a Darkspawn, describes this as a voice in your head telling you to kill.
<ul><li> Lampshaded early in the game when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Alistair</a> explains how to end the invasion: "We cut off the snake's head."
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in two ways: First, if you complete "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWiththeDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWiththeDevil">the dark ritual</a>", the Archdemon isn't <em>actually</em> killed. Secondly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em>, it turns out that many Darkspawn didn't go underground, and most of the game is spent fighting them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance">Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance</a></em>, killing a boss causes all of his minions will drop dead.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Wars Original Generation</a></em>: after Bian Zoldark is defeated, his troops scatter, but only because he previously gave them the order to do so if he was killed.
<ul><li> Although quite a few of them try to regroup under his second in command to continue their war. Essentially everyone in the force that wasn't in on the plan of submitting to the Federation upon his defeat or those that only agreed thinking they wouldn't lose and changed their minds when they did, kept fighting. And when these guys are defeated a few remenants go into hiding and again try to restart the war in the next game.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a></em>. On the second level, there's a large windbag guarding the core being supported by many smaller windbags. Defeating the head windbag will cause the others to shift their loyalty towards you... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind">and then spontaneously die.</a>
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones">Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones</a></em>, since all of the sand monsters dissolve once you kill off The Vizier.
</li><li> A <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game for the Game Boy Advance has mechanics which embody this trope. The battlefield is divided into three stripes - the middle and the flanks. All three can have leaders on them - either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">named characters</a> or generic captains. Those generate command points, which are required to make units act on the battlefield. When a stripe is devoid of those - either because they died or left for another one - only the natural rate of command point generation applies, which happens to be "one point or none at all". So, basically - without a leader, units stand without orders, and the enemy can slaughter them however he pleases.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CenturionDefenderOfRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CenturionDefenderOfRome">Centurion: Defender of Rome</a></em> the death of a general is followed by the general retreat of a significant part of his army. If the units aren not very brave to begin with then it overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">Keystone Army</a>. Also provides an strategical example; if the player loses Italy, taxes are no longer collected in any province.
<ul><li> And if that's not enough, numerous enemy provinces have the enemy general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">out in front</a> — meaning that he's likely the first unit to fall in battle.

Despite the fact they had basically won the war a month ago but it's probably best not to think too much about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommanderKeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommanderKeen">Commander Keen</a> Episode 3: Keen Must Die</em>, Keen faces the Vorticons, a dog-like alien race, who try to do everything to kill Keen. When Keen kills his arch-enemy Mortimer McMire, the vorticons instantly return to their previous peaceful life, as it turns out Mortimer used to be enslaving the whole race with "mind-belts".

Killing Daisy Fitzroy doesn't put an end to the Vox Populi. In fact, they've remained a threat, if not bigger than ever throughout the game now that Daisy is no longer controlling them.
<ul><li> Also averted for the Founders. By the time you kill Comstock, most of his army has been put through the ringer by a combination of Booker, the Vox Populi, hurricane weather, and thousands of tears. Any boys in blue who have survived up to this point cannot hope to dent the Vox's blimp armada.

<ul><li> The penultimate mission of the original game ends as soon as you kill Grinko - the still-surviving mercenaries under him figure that, with him dead, there's no reason to keep doing a job they're no longer getting paid for.
</li><li> In <em>Pandora Tomorrow</em>, the capture of Darah Dan Doa leader Suhadi Sadono effectively ends the conflict in East Timor. Given that he was really only perpetuating the war by threatening to release a deadly virus on the world if he is killed, and then explicitly fighting on the front lines to keep his forces from being defeated (because their opponents refused to fight back for fear of killing him), as soon as that pesky virus issue is resolved and he's taken captive, the Darah Dan Doa is overwhelmed in short order.

Credits then say they start running away.
<ul><li> <em>Raiden Fighters 2</em> ends with the same possible result. But the ending credits do say it's important to keep watch of the enemy. Cue <em>Raiden Fighters Jet</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight and then subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>; gameplay-wise, destroying the enemy flagship in the final level is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>, justified by the fact that said flagship contains the almost-literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of the enemy faction and morale would almost certainly collapse immediately. (Though in practice the flagship is so far from the action that you won't get near it until the enemy have already been pounded flat.) Ambiguously canon semi-sequel <em>Cataclysm</em> then goes on to explore what happened next: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> deteriorated into full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">a few vengeful hardliners</a> are <em>still</em> mounting raids on the titular Homeworld fifteen years later.
</li><li> This trope forms a key game mechanic in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Langrisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Langrisser">Langrisser</a></em> series. Killing an enemy leader will cause the subordinate units in the squad to die automatically. Thus, taking out the leader first removes the threat from the map but limits the possible experience the player can gain, while killing each individual unit maximizes experience gained but requires more time and resources (since sub units get buffs from their leader's field of influence).
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Deadshot</a> is apparently such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> that any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> who hasn't yet been taken out will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">instantly run for the exit</a> as soon as Batman has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalKO">taken care</a> of their boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FEAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FEAR">Fear</a></em>'s penultimate level, killing Paxton Fettel causes the Replica Soldiers he was commanding to freeze in place.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series has a long standing history of averting this trope:
<ul><li> After the final battle with Big Boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>, Snake and Holly are pursued by Zanzibarland troops to the rendezvous point, where Charlie pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">Gunship Rescue</a>.
</li><li> Two occasions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> after Snake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">seemingly defeats Liquid</a>. The first occurs after shooting down the Hind. Snake even notes that just because he's taken out their leader doesn't mean that the terrorists will give up. The second time is after Snake knocks Liquid off Metal Gear and Snake and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Meryl/Otacon</a> must escape and have to battle Genome soldiers on the way out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Of course, when Liquid finally does die, they are not pursued any further</a>.
</li><li> After Sergei's death at the end of the plant chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, his daughter Olga simply takes over from him offscreen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, after Volgin dies, his troops still come after Snake and EVA and pursue them all the way to the lake. Even after Snake takes out The Boss and has his final confrontation with Ocelot, MiGs chase the WiG with the intention of shooting it down (though they back off due to orders from Kruschev).
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em>. When Big Boss/Snake lands in a coma at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes">Ground Zeroes</a></em>, the entire organization of MSF essentially collapses along with him. A cassette tape found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">The Phantom Pain</a></em> reveals that Miller tried to recruit some MSF survivors to Diamond Dogs during the nine-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, but they refused to come back simply because Snake wasn't there. On top of it all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> reveals that Snake is the <em>only</em> reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Miller and Ocelot work together at all</a>, or any of the Mother Base staff for that matter; he outright states that Diamond Dogs would collapse without him.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Emperor</a> is killed in his cyclone castle, Leon simply takes over the Empire.. then loses it BACK to the Emperor when he returns from Hell with newfound powers. Played straight with the second battle with the Emperor, which is the final boss fight of the game, where his soul is destroyed, and presumably his empire as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> plays with this trope quite a bit. The goal of AVALANCHE in the opening Midgar parts of the game is to destroy the Mako Reactors controlled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Shinra</a> to wreck them. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">President Shinra</a> is killed by Big Bad Sephiroth at the end of these segments, it looks like Shinra is toast.... then his son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Rufus</a> appears and takes over the company for the majority of the rest of the game, and Shinra continues to antagonize the player forces throughout.
<ul><li> Played straight when Rufus himself is killed toward the end of Disc 2. Although Co-Dragons Heidegger and Scarlet take command, it's made clear by the Turks and other civilians that Rufus's death has left the company's private army without direction, and Heidegger and Scarlet are not cut out for leadership. Then Heidegger and Scarlet are killed in the Proud Clod boss fight near the end of the Midgar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc Two Final Dungeon</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">rogue scientist Hojo,</a> Sephiroth's father, who is attempting to destroy the city, is killed by AVALANCHE in a following boss fight, ending the dungeon and leaving Shinra completely leaderless and insignificant for the final disc of play. Rufus turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">to have survived,</a> but his office was destroyed, and the rest of Shinra Headquarters is destroyed by Meteor in the ending.</span> Although Shinra returns in Advent Children, they had shrunk considerably in the 3 years since the end of the game.
</li><li> Game play wise, this is one of the winning requirements in the Fort Condor battles. After enough time has passed on the battlefield, the enemy commander will pop up and start advancing himself. If the troops you are hiring are able to kill him (you will need a good number of troops), you win the battle. It's also played straight if the enemies rush the shed where the player is directing the Fort Condor forces, which will force the player party into a mini-boss fight against the commander, a much stronger version of the Grand Horn enemy. The team simply needs to kill the mini-boss to win the battle. In the final Fort Condor battle, which is part of the main storyline and thus has to be faced, this is recommended to get a very strong piece of armor, but if the player is defeated in this battle, they lose Fort Condor, the Huge Materia in it, and the Phoenix Summon Materia.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle">Ogre Battle</a></em>
<ul><li> Clearing maps is usually accomplished by defeating the boss of that map. You don't even need to beat the boss's whole unit, just the boss themself. Similarly, you lose if your leader dies.
</li><li> With all other units, killing the unit leader won't remove the unit outright, but after the battle the survivors will ignore all orders and try to retreat back to the base.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics">Telepath Tactics</a></em>, killing a starred character will cause an instant victory. In the campaign, this means that killing bosses usually causes you to win the mission instantly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">The same vulnerability applies to your protagonists, however.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em> averts this with most bosses: their death does not kill all their flunkies, and you'll still have to deal with them even after the boss dies. Played straight with Mom (and post-Mom bosses), where the death of the primary boss triggers the death of everything else in the room instantly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a></em>, you lose automatically if your Genius is killed. Justified, of course, as the Genius is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">Player Avatar</a>, but also justified because if your Evil Genius was kept deep in the base, the good guys would have to fight their way through <em>all</em> of your traps and minions to get to you. Still, it's particularly annoying when your Genius is watching an agent get tortured in the middle of an otherwise airtight base, and he escapes and kills the player while the guards were all elsewhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasurePlanetBattleAtProcyon">Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon</a></em> has this in the campaign. If your command ship sinks, then you get a game over, even if the rest of your fleet could have certainly taken out the remaining enemy ships. Presumably, Jim went down with his ship. In skirmish mode, due to there being no story or viewpoint character, this is averted, and losing the command ship simply means that the next ship in line takes over.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions">Dominions</a> series, you need commanders to lead your troops. If everyone present capable of leading undead is killed or fleed, the undead melt away. Similarly, if everyone present who can lead magical units dies or flees, that's that for magical units. And if every commander at the battle — which could be only one skilled commander with 300 troops — dies? Well, the entire army will rout, even if they outnumber the enemy a hundred to one.

They mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">keep to themselves and do not attack unless provoked</a>. However, historically, there have been some groups of Giants who have organized into clans numbering in the hundreds. Giants who organize into these clans are typically led by a high chieftain with "absolute" authority. In times of war, the high chieftain will rally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">an army of Giants</a> for organized attacks. If the chieftain is killed, however, the clan tends to fall quickly into disarray.
</li><li> This is also frequently true of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">Goblin</a> tribes. Killing the Warlord/Warchief (who is typically the largest and strongest Goblin of a tribe) and/or the tribe's shaman will typically cause the rest to crumble. Crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">Keystone Army</a>, the death of a Warchief or shaman sometimes causes the other tribe members to stop attacking altogether.

Therefore, if you are preparing to fight a large nation with many vassals and multiple allies that you cannot overcome through military power alone, assassinating the leader of that nation will pass power to their heir, who will immediately lose the support of the nation's vassals (because new leaders are regarded as weak and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">ripe for a coup d'etat</a>) as well as any alliances they don't keep through their immediate connections (since alliances in the game are often cemented through marriage, a long-term ruler keeps alliances through their children, but the heir does <em>not</em> necessarily keep alliances through their siblings). It's even possible to see a large realm splinter into factional infighting, which you can then mop up by sweeping in with your combined army to conquer the counties you covet. However, this can (and almost certainly <em>will</em>) happen to <em>you</em> too!

Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>'s victories were based on having his Phalangial infantry hold off the numerically superior enemy while Alexander and his Companion horsemen cut their way through to the enemy leader and either killed him or forced him to flee the field, causing the collapse of enemy resistance. This was the tactic that won the day at the Battle of Issus and led to the collapse of the Persian empire.
<ul><li> There were a few cases where this backfired, notably at the battle of Chalons, where Attila's army was having a successful go at fighting the Roman's allies, the Goths, until the old king Theodoric the Goth fell off his horse and died, upon which a cry of "Avenge the King!" went out amongst the Goths, who proceeded to drive off the Huns.
</li></ul></li><li> The U.S government has been guilty of this, killing off high-ranking members of drug cartels and terrorist organizations again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and <em>again.</em> The success rate of these incidents has varied; sometimes it does the job, while in others it gives the group an extra incentive to hate America.
<ul><li> This is a problem with such groups that have a large following of devotees. If you cut off the head, this will only strengthen the devotees because that person will be seen as a martyr. Furthermore killing the leader only ensures that he'll be replaced with someone younger — meaning they're more idealistic, less prone to battle fatigue, and eager to prove themselves. In theory, they should also be less experienced, but this doesn't mean much to terrorists who have grown up in war zones. As for drug cartels, targeting their leaders only causes the cartel to fracture into smaller groups, resulting in an increase in the drug supply as each competes with the others.
<ul><li> The US and other modern militaries also subvert it, with a very particular chain of command. Taking out a general just means that command devolves upon the next guy in line who, if the general did his job correctly, knows all the same information. Taking out <em>several</em> links in the chain of command at once, such as by a lucky artillery hit on a command post, is another matter, however.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Primate research ran across a case like this: an exceptional individual led his troop on a successful campaign of expanding the troop's territory against all the other troops nearby. Removal of said individual from his troop and territorial boundaries returned to their prior state. They returned him to his troop and the "conquest" started all over again.
</li><li> This combines with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">Straight for the Commander</a> to be the rationale of #18 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems">The Thirty-Six Stratagems</a>. The corollary is that the leader might be too well protected to get to immediately, or they might set out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyLeader">Decoy Leader</a> to invoke other stratagems.
</li><li> Multiple occurrences on either side of the war in the long-running Chinese Three Kingdoms war.
</li><li> The Allies planned to defeat Germany in World War II by killing Hitler, although he did it (by committing suicide) before they could get him. In retrospect, it's most likely a good thing that he wasn't killed, as many (like to) believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">his micromanaging the war, plus pinning his generals against each other</a> was a major element of the Axis defeat.
<ul><li> While there wasn't a death of the head of the military for Japan (at least, in a military operation), the war continued on for many a Japanese soldier because they refused to believe Japan would surrender. It took one person nearly 35 years to stand down because he was waiting for orders from his CO.
</li></ul></li><li> In the lesser version of war: any time the best player of a sports team is injured/leaves/retires, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">it'll be tough for the team to win without him.</a> Which is why it's usual to have a defender following the standout (and possibly injure him out of the game...).
</li><li> The Prussian Army came very close to this trope in the battle of Auerstedt (14 October 1806) when its commander, the Duke of Brunswick, was incapacitated by a (mortal) wound. King Frederick William III, who was present on the field, then failed to appoint a new commander-in-chief or to try to take command himself. The resultant loss of co-ordination between the various parts of the army (two-fifths of which were not even brought into action until the retreat already started) enabled Davout's outnumbered corps to score a remarkable victory.
</li><li> When in late 1813 some Allied roving corps attacked French-held Bremen, they could not make any impression on the city's fortifications. Then a rifleman belonging to the Lützow Free Corps managed to kill the French commandant with what even contemporaries described as a lucky shot. Shortly afterward, the garrison, which consisted largely of Swiss soldiers, capitulated.
</li><li> On February 22, 2002, Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was killed in battle by government forces. Three weeks later, his army, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had signed a ceasefire with the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), and by August had disarmed and disbanded its military forces, bringing the Angolan Civil War to an end after 27 years.
</li><li> A political example: the 1968 campaign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> was cut short by his assassination. He remains the only presidential candidate to have been killed while on campaign, and after his death, the U.S. Secret Service's mandate was extended to protect presidential candidates.
<ul><li> Or perhaps not. At the time of his assassination, Kennedy was a somewhat distant second in the count of Democratic Party delegates to Hubert Humphrey, who would lose by a significant margin to Richard Nixon in the general election.
</li></ul></li><li> Causing this was the whole idea of blitzkrieg: fast-moving tank columns disrupt supplies and command and control, leaving the enemy army leaderless.
<ul><li> This strategy has several weaknesses, however, in that it requires either strategic surprise<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2naec');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2naec" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2naec');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which means that the attacking force can't be too big, as it will be noticed, but if it is noticed all the same, it will be overwhelmed by any mistake in the attack</span> or overwhelming force<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3uw4t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3uw4t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3uw4t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which means sacrificing strategic surprise to amass the forces needed, allowing the defender to prepare, and possibly ambush the attacker, blunting the attack right there</span>. The Nazis, when they used it in World War 2, had strategic surprise <em>and</em> overwhelming force<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4puui');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4puui" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4puui');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The build up of German forces was an "open secret", but political leaders discounted it. In addition, the power of German tanks and the overwhelming advantage provided by the Luftwaffe simply could not be countered by the French and British forces in any meaningful, strategic way</span>, and achieved remarkable success as a result of encircling the French forces and making it to Paris with little meaningful resistance.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted">Double Subverted</a> by the death of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>. After he was killed in his hometown of Sirte on October 20, 2011, there were rumblings of an insurgency continuing afterwards, which appeared to be unfounded until an uprising in January 2012 occurred in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid. The uprising was initially reported as one by pro-Gaddafi troops, but it eventually turned out to just be a group of local tribesmen, and a serious Gaddafist insurgency in Libya has failed to manifest as of this writing.
</li><li> The battle of Novi, on 15 August 1799, opposed General Barthélémy Joubert's French Republican armies to Marshal Alexander Suvorov's Russian and Austrian force. Joubert was killed at the beginning of the battle, which ended in a French defeat. There was no mass panic among the soldiers, as the other generals hid Joubert's death from them; but for lack on a single commander who could see the battle from above and move the troops wherever they were needed, the French left-wing, centre and right-wing each effectively found themselves fighting a separate battle against a unified Allied army.
</li><li> A noted weakness of the Napoleonic empire, which was being held together militarily and politically only by the will of a single man. General Malet tried to exploit this with his attempt to overthrow the Empire in 1812, where a fake announcement of the Emperor's death was enough for several senior officers and whole battalions to follow him and arrest several high-ranking officials without asking questions. This was after Napoleon thought he had secured his new dynasty by having a son... whom everyone kind of forgot during Malet's coup. Meanwhile, in Russia, everyone was painfully aware that the Grand Army would dissolve if Napoleon did die.
</li><li> Allegedly the Mongol invasion was stopped because Genghis Khan died and they had to return to their homeland to chose a new Khan.
<ul><li> This was the perennial nuisance of the Mongols: every time their Khan died, their campaigns stopped as the generals and princes returned to homeland for <em>kurultai</em> (the election of a new Great Khan). This happened after the death of Tzinghis, Ögödei, Güyük, Möngke, and Kubilai. After the death of Kubilai, the Empire disintegrated.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the Arab invasion of Europe failed due to the Battle of Tours where they lost to the Franks led by Charles Martel. Despite being numerically superior to their enemies, their commander Abdul Rahman al-Ghafiq was killed in combat, and infighting soon broke out among the many tribes and clans under his command leading to their retreat.
</li><li> This was the dilemma throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> for any nuclear power. Do you keep rigid political control of your nuclear arsenal, and risk a decapitation strike on the capital that will leave your country helpless? Or do you devolve responsibility to local military commanders who, if cut off from their superiors, might launch on their own authority when the politicians don't want them to?
</li><li> Subverted during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars">First Chechen War</a> when the Chechen dictator Dzhokhar Dudayev was assassinated with a laser-guided missile by the Russian forces. This, however, did nothing to halt the insurrection because the Chechens operated independently from a chief-in-command and obeyed only their field commanders within their personal militias. The Chechens managed to make Russia give up after retaking their occupied capital at the end of the first war.
