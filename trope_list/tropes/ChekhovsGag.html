<p>Most times, jokes come and go; they get their set up, make you laugh, and then they're done and you move on to the next joke. But sometimes, jokes aren't done with you. Sometimes, you find yourself not only going back to the joke, but having it bring a whole new twist - the first joke wasn't just a gag, but also set up for something else that blindsides you later on. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> being used as a joke in its first appearance.

</p><p>The first gag is always a set-up for whatever will happen later, though ideally it doesn't seem that way at first. If it isn't, then it's a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>. If the setup is played out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> moment, only for it to have closure later, then it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>. If a previously established joke becomes a serious event later on to the point it's no longer funny, then it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeAndReceive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeAndReceive">Joke and Receive</a>, which might have an immediate payoff courtesy of the universe that the joker wasn't expecting.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has the Harem Jutsu. Introduced in the second chapter, a gender-bent version is used against the Big Bad, Kaguya Ootsotsuki <em>680 chapters later.</em> The real kicker is, it works. Albeit, it distracts Kaguya by causing her to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">Distracted by the Sexy</a> rather than causing her to <em>totally</em> perv out, but it still lets them get their first actual hit in against her.
</li><li> In Episode 24 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em>, as Endou is preparing for an overnight training camp, a brief comic relief scene occurs where his mom hands him a pair of boxers with his name written in marker ("En" on the left butt cheek and "dou" on the right in <em>really</em> big handwriting, no less) to make sure he doesn't get his laundry mixed up with any of his teammates. Seven episodes later, Touko barges in on the boys changing, and gets an eyeful of Endou in his underwear - and he's actually wearing that very same pair of boxers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Luffy spends a lot of the earlier episodes asserting that their next crew member needs to be a musician, over things like a doctor or a cook. Sure enough, 300+ episodes later, the 9th Straw Hat pirate is Brook, an undead musician.
</li><li> When the World Government produces Sanji's wanted poster, instead of his photograph (the photographer accidentally left his lens cap on), there is a rather badly-drawn sketch of what officials <em>think</em> he looks like. This causes Duval to bear a grudge against Sanji, as his real face looks just like the sketch on the wanted poster, causing people to beat Duval up and arrest him for nothing he ever did, mistaking him for Sanji. Much later, the oddities with Sanji's wanted poster continue when it's simultaneously updated to include a proper photograph of him and an instruction that he's to be taken alive only (instead of the more typical Dead or Alive).
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy">Living Toy</a> in Dressrosa working as a waiter is absurdly evasive about the so-called fairies on the island, to the annoyance of people who talk to him. This is actually because these fairies, the Tontattas, are in an alliance with the toys on the island in a plot to overthrow the current king, hence the waiter toy remaining hush-hush to those not part of the alliance.
</li><li> Gladius is shown in one of his earliest scenes to get so angry at one of his comrades that he blows his top, causing his hat to explode as a sight gag. It turns out, many chapters later when he actually gets serious in battle, that he has the ability to inflate any non-living thing that comes in physical contact with him until it pops, including the landscape around him, making that first scene a hint to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> nature.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em>: In an early skit <em>High School Boys and Scary Stories (2)</em>, Hidenori mentioned Karasawa was "experienced in scary tales," and Tadakuni made up a story on how he saw what was under Karasawa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBareheaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBareheaded">cap</a>, remarking that it was hilarious. It's nowhere near funny at all, as his backstory unfolded: he was covered with scars—including an ugly scar on his forehead that he wears a cap to cover. These scars were courtesy of Habara, the girl who lives next to him and, eight years ago, was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">bully</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, when Lieutenant Hughes constantly discusses his wife and daughter, Colonel Mustang jokes that in war movies, the guy who's obsessed with his family always gets killed first. At first just an innocent joke, then it actually happens and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">isn't so funny anymore.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore! Nyarko-san</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happens all the time, as the most inconsequential remarks and jokes often turn out to be the lynchpin of the plot (to the growing frustration of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> male lead, Mahiro). In particular, a second season episode has Nyarko catch an Earthly cold and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping">discuss</a> the concept of powerful aliens having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weaknesses</a>. At the end of the episode, the evil invading aliens are defeated when Nyarko's ringtone, an alien pop song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">makes their heads explode</a> — a direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks">Mars Attacks!</a></em>, which Nyarko explicitly referenced during that earlier dialog.
</li><li> In another episode, the group visits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything">Great Big Library of Everything</a> because Nyarko has to return an overdue book, but they get sidetracked when two criminals ransack the place looking for a particular book. Trying to be smart, Mahiro guesses that Nyarko's overdue book is what they were after, but it turns out that this time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">he's</a></em> the one responsible, due to a copy of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavensMemoPad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavensMemoPad">Malign God's Memo Pad</a>" he idly picked up during their visit and accidentally pocketed. Nyarko even complains about how unfair it was for him to assume that she's always responsible for these things.
</li><li> Also subverted and discussed earlier; one episode introduces a vacuum cleaner, voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto">Norio Wakamoto</a>, apparently just to allow another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em>. At the end of another episode (which also featured it), both Mahiro and Nyarko remark that they <em>thought</em> the vacuum would turn out to be one of these, only to be proven wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em>, there is a humorous sequence where Akatsuki is trying to run away from Henrietta (or to be more precise, the dress in Henrietta's hands). <strong>Trying</strong> being the operative word, as Henrietta has privileges over the building (specifically, who can interact with doors, use skills, or fight). It ends with Akatsuki in a doll outfit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Shiroe</a> uses this precise ability to defeat the Hamelin guild, by banning them from entering the guild building (essentially locking them inside their own guild hall). He simultaneously uses the threat of this same ability to blackmail the major guilds into forming a council in order to bring law to the city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> has a couple.
<ul><li> We never see Undertakers eyes. It looks like a character quirk, but in both the anime and the manga this is to hide something, although this example only has significant impact on the plot in the manga.
</li><li> In the second episode/third chapter, Finny picks up a large stone statue and easily tosses it around in an attempt to crush a mouse. Its played for comedy, as part of the servants goofy antics. Later on in both the anime and the manga, we learn that Finny has super-strength, and is a formidable opponent in battle.
</li><li> Whenever Bard blows up the kitchen, its played for comedic value. Except when there are two intruders are trapped inside, and we learn that Bard's combat specialty is explosives.
</li><li> Vice-Principal Agares being clumsy.
</li><li> In the anime's third episode, Grell accidentally makes skull shaped topiary out of EVERY bush in the manor. "His" repeated suicide attempts also count.
</li></ul></li><li> In Episode 15 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TanteiTeamKZJikenNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TanteiTeamKZJikenNote">Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note</a></em>, there was a gag Wakatake's police-siren cell phone ringer, as Aya complained Wakatake's being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> even down to things like that. In the next episode, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">The Team</a> is in a stalemate with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">Japanese Delinquents</a>, Aya asks Kozuka to call Wakatake's cell phone, which breaks the stalemate by freaking out the delinquents.
</li><li> Yuki gets a cute mustached teddy bear very early into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive">School-Live!</a></em>. It doesn't become relevant until over thirty chapters in when Rii begins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">hallucinating</a> it is her younger sister.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, the girls are relaxing in a hot spring when they learn that the guys are already there (it's a unisex pool). Lucy and Wendy freak out, but Natsu and Grey point out that they've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">seen the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantFanserviceGirl">girls naked</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">so many times</a> that the novelty has worn off. Later, an enemy has Natsu pinned down and is using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a> magic to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">make Lucy's clothes disappear</a> in order to embarrass Natsu. This completely backfires since Natsu isn't the least bit embarrassed, but the enemy mage <em>is</em>.
</li><li> You would think Elena's botched magical surgery on Taizou would be just one of the many gags that pepper <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel">The Voynich Hotel</a></em>. As it turns out, having your heart on the wrong side of your body is exactly the kind of thing that would win you a few more minutes by confusing your would-be killers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">allowing help to arrive just in the nick of time</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> Lelouch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeekPhysique">Geek Physique</a> is a recurring joke, with a particular incident have him epic fail at making a trap on an island to catch animals in. Then it's suddenly not so funny <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he accidentally Geasses his half-sister Euphemia into "killing all the Japanese" with him unable to catch up to her before she reaches the stage and sets off a massacre.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, the series' biggest source of comedy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> Sousuke Sagara <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">being placed in a mundane Japanese high school</a> and causing chaos and destruction by acting like he's still on the battlefield. In <em>Ending Day by Day</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">adapted</a> as the early part of <em>Invisible Victory</em>), Amalgam terrorists hold the school hostage by secretly planting bombs throughout the building, and Sousuke asks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> Hayashimizu (one of the few people who understands his situation) for help. All Hayashimizu has to do is get on the school's intercom and tell everyone "Well, Sagara's done it again", and they evacuate the building with such speed and efficiency that the terrorists are left gobsmacked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em>, the Future Gadgets team built several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">ridiculously useless</a> inventions prior to building the Phone Wave that kicks off the plot.

<ul><li> The ending is this. We get a gag of a knight on horseback killing the Famous Historian, and then at the end the police investigating the historian's murder show up and arrest King Arthur. The investigation is shown between scenes several times during the movie. It's why Lancelot isn't in the end scene.
</li><li> The end credits are also an example — there aren't any, since the credits people were all fired for the moose-related nonsense in the <em>opening</em> credits.
</li><li> Also, the bit with King Arthur getting to cross the Bridge of Death by responding to the question about the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow with a question of his own, directly from the first scene of the film. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, Bedivere ties a coconut to a swallow and releases it in his first scene. It puts a new light on his comment after Arthur's Bridge of Death questions.
</li><li> Upon meeting the French, they say they already have a Holy Grail, then at the end they are in the castle with the Grail in it.
</li><li> At the end of the Bring Out Your Dead bit, someone comments that Arthur must be a king because he hasn't got shit all over him. The French at the end dump shit on him. Twice.

It is initially treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the first part of the film, but then in the climax the Ghost Rider attempts to use his skill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">to save the day</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which instead causes him to die in the crash, or otherwise getting severely wounded and unconscious</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarWright">Edgar Wright</a> made an art out of the Chekhov's Gag in his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodAndIceCreamTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodAndIceCreamTrilogy">Cornetto Trilogy</a>": <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">Shaun of the Dead</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd">The World's End</a></em> are chock full of them. Lines that were funny earlier on in the story become rather morose and depressing later, or alternatively everything that wasn't a joke comes back as a joke, and a lot early jokes come back as funnier jokes. For instance, the quote "You've got red on you" in <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> was said to the protagonist very early in the movie as a result of him having a red pen in his pocket that had leaked onto the rest of his shirt. Later, it was said about the blood that had been splattered all over him.

During the climax Dale throws a box of chamomile tea at Chad, which causes him to have an asthma attack and fall to his apparent death.
</li><li> The one funny moment in the new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em> movie: An actor attributes his last film's failure to the costume department. This is presented as a spoiled actor making excuses and then forgotten about until an hour later, when he's watching TV and the film comes on, showing him in a snowstorm wearing an enormous fur hat and yelling, "TURN BAAACK!". It was worth seeing the rest of the movie for that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutterIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutterIsland">Shutter Island</a></em> has a brief gag when the two main characters enter Shutter Island - after being ordered to surrender their guns, US Marshal Teddy Daniels quickly takes his revolver out of his holster, but his partner Chuck struggles to get it out. After several seconds of Chuck struggling, he eventually gets...the entire holster off. On second viewings of the film, it becomes clear that Chuck can't get it out because he's not really a US Marshal, and has never actually used a gun.

However, they do have an example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">first movie</a> with the joke about Uncle Joey not making parole in 1985.

<ul><li> Five books later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a></em> series, Annabeth proclaiming the Laistrygonian giants to be "Canadians" in <em>Sea of Monsters</em> is brought back up in <em>Son of Neptune</em> where Percy calls them Canadians... in front of genuine Canadian Frank Zhang. Frank is not pleased.
<ul><li> In another Frank-related moment, Frank trying to figure out Chinese handcuffs in <em>The Mark of Athena</em> seems like another joke at Frank's expense, with him never having seen them before (and being a little annoyed at the name, as he's part-Chinese)—but Annabeth ends up using the design of the toy to trap Arachne.
</li></ul></li><li> Book #6 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainUnderpants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainUnderpants">Captain Underpants</a></em> series has George and Harold introducing a new joke called Squishies, which consists of putting ketchup packets under toilet seats so that they squirt onto the legs of whoever sits on the toilet. The next book has Captain Underpants use this with crates of oranges and a giant novelty toilet as a method of defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villains of the Book</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pratchett frequently has a ditzy or naive character relay some kind of aphormism or cliche—for example, the bard telling Cohen the Barbarian about the Gordian Knot, or Magrat explaining how some martial artists can walk on coals without getting burnt, only to have the older, more world-wise listener scoff and pick apart all the logical holes in it. And <em>then,</em> during the climax, the world-wise character is confronted with a situation that requires them to dive right into the aphormism. Upon which they will give their younger companion some sort of nod of acknowledgement.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Bit of a <em>knotty</em> one. You'll remember I said that, lad?"
</div><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad">Witches Abroad</a></em>. "Glod". And in that same book, Granny Weatherwax's absolute certainty of who she is and where she stands, and tendency to refuse to follow stories which attempt to include her in their plots is frequently discussed in side remarks after seeing it put into action, the first example being her inability to understand Magrat's attempt to "relate to herself" at a conceptual level, gradually building up the reader's knowledge of this aspect of her character. Surprise, surprise, that certainty comes into effect at the end of her book. Both she and her evil sister Lily are trapped separately within a shattered mirror, and Death tells both of them - separately - that they can escape "When you find the [reflection] that's real". Lily, who has lived on stories for most of her life, runs on "through the endless reflections", with the implication that she will never escape. Granny asks if this is a trick question, then looks down at herself. "This one".
</li></ul></li><li> Happens fairly often in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books, understandable considering the sheer size of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmory">Chekhov's Armory</a>. Multiple plot devices are first introduced as gags:
<ul><li> The Vanishing Cabinet gets this treatment twice, first trashed by Nearly Headless Nick to get Harry out of trouble with Filch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber of Secrets</a></em>, then used as a joke by Fred and George in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em> when they shove Montague into it. The latter incident is mentioned directly when the Cabinet becomes a serious plot device in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Half-Blood Prince</a>.</em>
</li><li> Hermione signing up for every class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber Of Secrets</a></em> is also treated as a character joke, until it's revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em> that Hermione's had to use a Time-Turner to get to all her classes, which is then used to save Sirius and Buckbeak.
</li><li> Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes are introduced in a humorous way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, but many of them play a larger role than expected in later books, particularly those used by the trio in their attempt to infiltrate the corrupted Ministry of Magic.
</li><li> The Room of Requirement is indirectly mentioned in an offhand humorous way by Dumbledore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet Of Fire</a></em>; in the final three books, it becomes the most important room in all of Hogwarts.
</li><li> Harry was bequeathed the golden snitch he caught in his first Quidditch game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">The Philosopher's Stone</a></em>. It is well know that the golden snitch can be used to hide small items inside it and can only be opened by the touch of the person that first held it in the game. When Harry is made to pick it up by Scrimgeour, who is trying to gain information from the protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">The Deathly Hallows</a></em>, he barely hesitates and glaringly shows nothing happens. Once Scrimgeour left, he explains to Ron and Hermione why it didn't work. When he first caught the snitch, it was humorously shown that they won because he had accidentally caught it in his mouth. Which is the touch the snitch needed to open.
</li><li> This carried over to the movies too. The films gave Seamus a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in which he would blow things up by mistake (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">usually happened in the background</a>.) Sure enough, when they decide to blow up the bridge leading into Hogwarts, they <em>immediately</em> turn to Seamus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy1">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> opens with a monologue describing all the troubles and widespread unhappiness on Earth, and how one London woman suddenly had an epiphany about how all of that could be solved that was tragically cut short by the destruction of Earth. It then goes on to note "This is not her story" and rambles a bit about the titular Hitchhiker's Guide. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a></em> opens with a word-for-word repeat of that exact same monologue, but instead ends with the line "This is her story."
</li><li> In the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em>, it's mentioned that Crowley made changes to the plans for the M25 to make it a demonic sigil. This sets up his character (he likes to do large amounts of low-grade evil), and once the apocalypse comes it turns into a rather nasty barrier, that completely destroys his car as he crosses it.
</li><li> In the sixth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant">Skulduggery Pleasant</a></em> book, the titular character concludes an interrogation of a minor villain by punching him in the face and knocking him unconscious, briefly shocking his apprentice Valkyrie. Because of this, Valkyrie suggests they make a code for "I'm about to punch him", to which Skulduggery suggests "The sparrow flies south for winter". Valkyrie is adamant that it's too hard to slip into a conversation, proven when Skulduggery blurts it out in the middle of the sentence while undercover shortly later. Despite this, the quote is used multiple times in the next few books, despite frequently being admitted to being silly.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> book Blood Rites, one of the characters constantly gets Harry's name wrong. Later in the book where it turns out that since she either is not smart enough to remember or just does not care, when the time comes for his name to be vital (in framing him for a murder) she gave the police the wrong name. Harry finds this appropriately hilarious and sad.
</li><li> At <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays">Around the World in 80 Days</a></em> there are multiple references to Passepartout's watch falling further behind as they travel east, and how the proud Frenchman refuses to touch the heritage of his ancestors. An explanation in Chapter 11 regarding how the days are shorter when one travels eastbound foreshadows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTwits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTwits">The Twits</a></em>: Turns out the Shrinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">is a real disease</a> you can get from being upside-down for too long.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AMurderIsAnnounced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AMurderIsAnnounced">A Murder Is Announced</a></em> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a></em>: As everyone files into Little Paddocks, each arriving party remarks on the exact same trivial things — the roses and the fact that the central heating is on — to humorous effect, as noted by Julia. It turns out that the fact that the central heating is on so early in the autumn season is a vital clue — it meant that the murderer had intentionally left the fireplace off, ensuring that there would be no light when the power went out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity">Relativity</a></em>, Sara and Greg have just gotten married when they bump into Sara's old flame, Martin Bling. When Bling finds out Greg is a chef, he mentions that he may want to visit his restaurant one day. Sara mutters under her breath, "Maybe you'll get food poisoning." Ten stories later (and over a year, in-universe), Bling does go to Greg's restaurant... and gets poisoned. His lawyers dig up the security footage of Sara and hire lip-readers to figure out what she said. Oops.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> 's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaskOfAmonillado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaskOfAmonillado">The Cask Of Amonillado</a></em>, the narrator pulls out a trowel to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a> on 'mason'. Later on, we find he had it on him for a reason.

In response, Mary gets Dick's hands (and face) stuck to his desk with thermal bond epoxy. While Dick is slowly, and painfully, removed, they finally come to a truce. Mere seconds afterward, they hear a loud, booming noise from outside.

<ul><li> Also involving Fred is one early episode for her, where she's built some odd looking contraption involving an axe. Multiple character speculate that it looks like "it is either a decapitation device or (knowing Fred) it makes toast". Come the climax of the episode, she actually busts it out and does, in fact, decapitate a demon with it by launching the axe across the room using a foot pedal.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> <em>[on why she built it]</em> I was just thinking about what if, like, you arms got cut off and you needed to fight. It would be pretty hard to do... or to make toast for that matter.

Afterwards, Chandler told Joey he saw Donald Trump while waiting for a lift and Joey also fields a call from Chandler's hotel regarding a forgotten eyelash curler.

To Ralph's consternation, EVERY SINGLE song is preceded by Norton "warming up" which consists of the first few notes of "Way Down Upon the Swanee River" followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinskyPickup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinskyPickup">"dadum, dadum dum DUM!"</a> But after studying almost every popular song in existence, guess what the first song he gets on "The $99,000 Answer" is? And guess who it is that composed that song?

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> does this from time to time such as in Life Among the Gorillas where Marshall's coworkers repeatedly come up with bizarre celebrity comparisons (where the point seems to involve who you'd rather sleep with) while asking, "What do you do? Go!" Its reframed in the last moment of the episode when Robin calls Ted to invite him over and Narrator Ted asks, "What do you do? Go!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>, in the episode "The Waitress is Getting Married". At the beginning of the episode, we see Charlie trapping a nest of live hornets in a box, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">thinking they'll make honey for him</a>. Charlie then spends the episode dealing with the discovery that the girl he's obsessed with is engaged. In the final scene, he takes a wedding gift to her fiancée. On discovering that he only proposed as part of a cruel prank on the girl, Charlie tells him to keep the gift anyway. As he walks away, we see that the box is the one with the hornet's nest in it.
</li><li> Frequently occurs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em>, where a seemingly completed comic scenario returns following the solution of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">episode's mystery</a> to deal the final (hilarious) blow. For example in one episode, Carla is doing a book signing and there is a comic scenario involving a fan's (fully grown) nephew crushing her lap whilst posing for a photo. This is pretty funny in it's own right, but much later on Jonathan discovers that the fan and nephew had really tricked Carla into signing a consent form for her likeness to be used on a range of sex merchandise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive">Kamen Rider Drive</a></em> has a cop, Lt. Otta, who always hilariously screws up the name "Roidmude", the robots who serve as the series' villains, and for the longest time was skeptical about their existence despite all the evidence. Eventually, we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Secretary of Defense is a Roidmude with the ability to alter memories and takes great pains to ensure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Police Are Useless</a>.

At the end of the episode, he jumps in front of the camera and says to the audience, "DON'T have a cheesy ending-noone would believe it".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> episode "The Stepford Peg", while Al and the kids discuss the schedule Al planned out for Peg, Kelly brings up the upstairs bathroom that Peg had cleaned, claiming that there's a window above the sink and she saw a girl who looks exactly like her. This seems like a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> joke, but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTag">The Tag</a> shows up, in which Kelly walks up to Bud and introduces him to the girl next door.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrYoung">Mr. Young</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode of this Canadian teen sitcom, Tater says he asked someone if they'd seen a Fryers chicken head, then pulls out a poultry chart and says he thought he meant a medium-sized frier chicken, as opposed to the slightly larger grosser and the slightly smaller boiler. in a later episode, Adam says his mom's "giant man eating chicken" scam doesn't seem very believable, since "chickens are not carnivores, and according to this poultry chart, even a grosser doesn't weigh more than 7 pounds". It turns out to actually be a <em>giant man</em> eating chicken.
</li><li> In the same episode with the "giant man eating chicken", Adam tries to knock over a stack of milk cans, but he's not strong enough, even though he keeps hitting them. Later, Adam goes on a slingshot, and when he lands he hits the milk cans with his head, yet he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">still</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">fails to knock them over.</a>

For example:
<ul><li> "Eegah" has Dr. Forrester remove TV's Frank's blood and replace it with radiator fluid for the Invention Exchange. At the end of the episode, Dr. Forrester has to give Frank a tune-up because the coolant ran out.
</li><li> "Manhunt In Space" has Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank show off bean bag chair pants (pants with a bean bag chair built in). They test them out and promptly fall onto their backs. At the end of the episode, Joel contacts them and finds they're still lying on their backs.
</li><li> "Time of the Apes" has the Mads create the Miracle-Grow Baby which starts as an infant and grows up very quickly. At the end of the episode, we see the baby has grown to adulthood. While Forrester and Frank argue over who's going to change the baby and who's going to push the button, the baby says "I'll push the button" and does so.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> has two shining examples:
<ul><li> An early episode has Dillon try to ditch training, while Dr. K tells him he has to learn to be ready for anything. To drive the point home, when he opens the fridge to get a drink, she has a ludicrously over-sized laser cannon emerge. Later on, a comedic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a> fight has broken out, and to deliver the finishing blow Dillon pops open the fridge...

Flynn's morpher then develops a glitch, and he has an idea of how to fix it, but there's the risk of a side effect - namely, an even <em>bigger</em> explosion.

However, Vince's eventual ultimatum to Cameron is to challenge him to "name all of the actors who played Doctor Who". Cameron can name Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, "that bloke with the white hair" and "the vet". Vince decides that they're breaking up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced">Spaced</a></em>, the characters are out boozing when Mike stands up, announces he is going to point the pink pistol at the porcelain firing range, and leaves. We assume that he's taking a trip to the loo. While he's gone, evil Matrix-style Agents turn up to take Daisy, but Mike returns to save the day, wielding a pink handgun.
</li><li> Special mention goes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, which had Sam and Dean joking about the existence of unicorns way back in season 2, with Dean sarcastically commenting that "There's a ton of lore om unicorns, too. In fact, I hear they ride on silver moonbeams and shoot rainbows out of their ass!". Five years later, a case revolves around strange deaths in a town including, sure enough, a man being murdered by a rainbow-farting unicorn.

Since Buddyroids are immune to it J is unaffected and Jin is able to slash the wick and put the flame out. Though it's entirely possible that Avatars are immune too as Jin is not really there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes">The Young Ones</a></em> was fond of this. In the episode "Bambi", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> visits the old idea that we are all microbes being observed by a giant scientist.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series often introduces vital evidence as jokes at first. A few examples:
<ul><li> Polly the parrot in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">the first game</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the boatman's house... until they deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>. Much later, the parrot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeTheDogTestify" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeTheDogTestify">is called to the stand at the trial</a>, and <em>everything</em> they've been trained to say turns out to have major significance to the case. Yes, even their <em>name</em>.
</li><li> In the second game, Franziska plants a tracking device on Gumshoe for the sole purpose of keeping an eye on him and to get the opportunity to whip him as soon as possible. This is initially shown as something on the long list of things that cements Gumshoe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status as well as Franziska's hostility. It comes into play when Gumshoe steals evidence from Shelley's second hideout in order to get it to Phoenix as soon as possible in an attempt to save Maya, but he crashes his car and breaks his phone in the process. Franziska manages to find him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">deliver the evidence just in time</a>.
</li><li> From the third game, Prosecutor Godot's visor making him unable to see red on a white background is originally introduced as a joke at the beginning of Case 3 when he fails to notice a comically large "bloodstain" (actually just ketchup) and gets pissed off that he wasn't told about it earlier (because everyone else assumed it was impossible for anyone to miss). This winds up outing him as the real killer of Case 5, when after the real location of the murder is discovered, Phoenix notices that the killer had removed some snow from the area to hide the blood. However, instead of just getting rid of the snow with blood on it, they dug out a large, perfectly square shape. This proves that the killer didn't know exactly where the blood was and wanted to make sure they got it all.
</li><li> Trucy's Magic Panties in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice</a></em>.

<ul><li> There's also <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2004/08/26/episode-455-self-fulfilling-stupidity/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> strip, where Black Belt unwittingly predicts who history remembers in terms of the heroes.

The pirate in that panel looks a lot like Bangladesh DuPree. It takes <a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20120222">two years and five months<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to start to guess what exactly Tarvek went through then.

Chapters later when Tarvek is taking a bath after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having been stuck in the time bubble for 2 and a half years</span>, those little scars she "worked so hard on" are the first things she wants to see.

Turns out the "Muscalibur" thing is real, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">another bard</a> resents Gildward for it...

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>:
<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> has a character expecting shaving cream to put out fire, only to learn it actually makes it worse. This is largely inconsequential until the end of Act 5; the Courtyard Droll attaches explosives to a pack of shaving cream and uses it to kill Jade right as she was supposed to save the Kids from being wiped from reality.
</li><li> John's hatred of Betty Crocker is based on his distaste for cake; little does he know she's an alien bent on taking over the Earth and re-creating her homeworld.
</li><li> Biscuits useless oven turns out to be actually very useful, just not for timetraveling. It actually turns out to function as a sort of portable, oven-sized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace">Hammerspace</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is that "if you believe hard enough in something it might become slightly less fake". With Jake English, it turns out this is <em>literally</em> true for him as a Page of Hope. Then in Act 6 Act 6, Jake gets to use his Page of Hope powers to make his view of Dirk, his former boyfriend, become real, by believing in his existence hard enough. This image of Dirk attacks a villain long enough for another hero, Roxy, to escape to another world before the villains destroy most of the planet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>, Vaarsuvius frequently uses Explosive Runes to play pranks on people V doesn't like (mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Belkar</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Miko</a>. (Explosive Runes places words on an object that explode when read.) Come strip 659, V formulates a plan to throw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Xykon's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">phylactery</a> into a rift. Xykon attempts to retrieve the phylactery, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">thanks to one of Xykon's earlier lectures</a>, V is more willing to use spells that do not directly strike at the enemy, and thus enchanted the phylactery with Explosive Runes. The explosion almost throws the phylactery into the rift anyway.
<ul><li> While recapturing an old fortress, Xykon pretends to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, only to transform an angelic warrior into a zombie and rave about how he'd <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0193.html">never thought of using flying zombies before.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> A few hundred strips later, Xykon rides a zombie dragon into battle; Roy <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0441.html">climbs onto the dragon and decapitates it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but this doesn't accomplish much because it's a telepathically-controlled zombie. Roy ends up dying because Xykon doesn't even need the dragon to fly, so he just blasts Roy and the dragon corpse out of the sky.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the longest running gags in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge">Bob and George</a></em> is Dr. Wily talking to himself about his evil plans, not realizing that someone is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe">right behind him</a>. He passed that down to his future robotic creation Zero, who doesn't realize that Dr. Wily is listening when he says that he killed the entire present-day cast after his first activation. Dr. Wily then decided not to activate Zero in his lifetime, leading to a happy ending where everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEscape">fakes their deaths</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropicalEpilogue">moves to Acapulco</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Web Original </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG">Dino Attack RPG</a></em>, the idea of a cyborg Mutant T-Rex was first brought up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingAlien">Laxus</a> as a joke while he was riffing <em>Dino Cop</em> with Andrew, Joike, Pterisa, and Dr. Cyborg before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>. In the Final Battle itself, Cyrista's Bane showed up... and nobody was laughing at the joke anymore.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Raocow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Raocow">raocow</a> played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnUntitledStory">An Untitled Story</a></em> and happened upon a heart container, he let his inner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> com out and yell "I FOUND A <strong>HEART!!!"</strong> Several games later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BunnyMustDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BunnyMustDie">Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils</a></em>, he came across another heart container and,... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcuNonY8FWs#t=10m14s">well,....<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> His reactions to previous hearts in BMD were very subdued and didn't use the metal-voice at all. The way-over-the-top version in the link was probably in response to people in the comments complaining about this.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>: In "Ayla and the Birthday Brawl", known practical joker Jericho is along on the trip. He's blind, but notorious for wearing clothing so horrid that people get nauseous or faint. He dresses nicely for the trip, but everyone teases him about it. Jokes ensue, including him claiming that while his clothes are nice, he's wearing an undershirt of DOOM underneath. Later on, the party is attacked. He takes out two mercenaries in power armor by showing them his undershirt and making them puke in their armor. Chekhov's Gag with emphasis on the gag?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic">Create.swf Adventures:</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TouhouNekokayou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TouhouNekokayou">Shenanigans in a Magical Forest</a></em>:
<ul><li> Respecting the original joke from MS Paint Adventures, almost every character must "retrieve their arms" almost immediately after they are introduced, usually as the first command they recieved. This may seem as if it doesn't qualify, but when you can go almost a 100 slides (which would be over several weeks and broken into small updates) without mention of arms, and then suddenly get hit by one out of the blue, it's safe to say that prior to the revival of the joke, most had forgotten about it.
</li><li> There's also Masha's seemingly useless bit of paper. It's only mentioned briefly after her "birth"... and doesn't show up again until the ending. She throws it at Cirno to calm her down.
</li></ul></li><li> Often done by Aaron Karo of <em>Ruminations</em> fame. He'll often bring up random subjects he thinks about in each issue, then come the last rumination, he ends it off with a clever callback to the previous ones before signing off with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">"Fuck me"</a>.
</li><li> In the <em>KISS Comics #1</em> review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">90s Kid</a> makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">pretty tasteless joke</a> about unearthing Kurt Cobain's body and propping it up onstage. Much later in the <em>Planet of the Symbiotes</em> review, this is what helps Linkara clue into the fact that 90s Kid isn't himself. Also, the real Kid would know that Kurt was cremated!
</li><li> Early on in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a>, it's mentioned that a mad scientist created a portal to an alternate Earth through which they exchange DVDs, but the alternate version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequels were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">still pretty disappointing</a>. Initially it just seems like a throwaway joke but much later on it turns out to actually be important to the plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheGastonTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheGastonTrilogy">The Gaston Trilogy</a></em>: Belle saying "My father is a genie! Hes crazy!" in "Gaston Seeks Satisfaction" seems like a one-off joke but actually affects the continuity of "Gaston's Ultimate Mission to Obtain Some Taco Bell", when Gaston remembers her saying he was a genie because someone referred to "crazy old Maurice". Then Monsieur D'Arque wants to take him to Genies R Us, and at the end he's in a lamp.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AsteroidQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AsteroidQuest">Polokoa Quest</a></em> has one that's a little meta. In March of 2015, Jukashi posted <a class="urllink" href="http://questden.org/kusaba/questdis/src/142566397588.png">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> parody comic with Rokoa as Dracula and Polo as a Belmont in the quest's discussion thread. It seemed like a one-off gag... until <a class="urllink" href="http://questden.org/kusaba/quest/res/590364.html#650178">Vampire Rokoa showed up in the quest proper,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> revealing that it was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.
</li><li> In a "Beyond Belief" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheThrillingAdventureHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheThrillingAdventureHour">The Thrilling Adventure Hour</a></em>, Frank Doyle purchases at auction a literal Chekhov's Gun (as in, a gun belonging to Anton Chekhov, playwright and werewolf hunter). It's turned into a gag by Lampshading the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> rule and then being stored inside Freud's cigar box. In a later episode, Frank brings out the gun (and the silver bullet loaded within) to defeat an entirely different monster, the Calaca.
</li><li> In Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonballZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonballZAbridged">Dragonball Z Abridged</a></em>, the following exchange occurs twice with a different ending each time:

At one point, a player simply opens his mouth to speak, and immediately has the other two players yell that he is being offensive - because it's 7:02 pm, which is when they're supposed to have a minute of silence for their friend Schmitty, who died at 7:02 of unknown causes. At the end of the video, the poker players get so offended by each other that they all pull out guns, when suddenly the ghost of Schmitty appears to stop them, informs them all that he himself died in a situation similar to the one they are currently in, and reminds them all that they can't expect everyone to know what will offend them.

</li><li> In the season 2 episode "Bart the Daredevil" Bart wants to attempt to jump Springfield Gorge on his skateboard. Homer stops him at the last moment and prepares to do it himself to scare Bart straight. Homer accidentally attempts the jump and ends up falling down the gorge. After being loaded into an ambulance, the ambulance immediately crashes into a tree and Homer goes down the gorge <em>again</em>. Over ten years later in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, the climax has Bart and Homer (unintentionally) make a successful jump of Springfield Gorge on Homer's motorcycle.

This jokes later becomes important to the plot; Lisa figures out that something is up when she wonders why Bob's family would pay extra for a custom-made coffin to comfort a dead guy.

<ul><li> One memorable example is when Peter, at the beginning of the episode, notes that he saw a Discovery Channel documentary on Fire Trucks, which then segues into a short and nonsensical fake documentary of Fire Trucks, which has them hunting gazelle in the savanna. It's funny, it's over, and out of mind... until, in the final scene, a Fire Truck suddenly attacks Peter on his lawn.

He directs her to the window, where the bill-board is on a building beside a children's hospital. When he pulls the trigger, the hospital blows up, and he makes a point about how he screwed up. Near the end of the episode, after a series of wild antics, he ends up in the boss' office again, and asks if he ever ended up getting the promotion. She makes a big point about how he blew up a hospital, and the episode ends with him in court.

<ul><li> One notable example had a steel wall not release properly from a slot in the ground, but when Wile E. Coyote went to check it, it didn't spring up on him right away. Instead, it waited till the end of the cartoon to pop up and stop Wile E. while he was chasing Road Runner.
</li><li> There was one where they set up one of his traps, and it goes off on him several times wrong before he gives up. So he goes for something else, in which the original trap went off him, then the combination of his next scheme and the attack was his downfall, then he'd almost get the roadrunner, and the trap would get him again.
</li><li> And there's another where he rigged up a "Free Glass of Water" with a match attached to the glass on top of a box containing TNT. Pulling the glass up would cause the match to light the fuse. The Road Runner ignores it and holds up a sign stating that Road Runners can't read and don't drink. Later on, Wile E. is crawling on the ground exhausted after another failed attempt and grabs the rigged glass, only realizing his mistake right before the TNT goes off.
</li><li> One time he affixed glider wings to sticks of dynamite and tried to launch them at the Road Runner. Not only didn't it work, but every few mintues through the rest of the cartoon, a dynamite glider would drift into the scene and blow him up.

A pretty tame gag by the standards of <em>The Far Side</em>. But in the sequel, there's a segment with amoebas at a party that's abruptly interrupted when their "world" goes sideways. The camera cuts to a man putting down a mostly-empty water glass... then pulls back to him and his family exiting the same exact Egypt scene (sans waving) from the first special.

Later, he tries to spit out the Accelerometer and instead spits out the elephant.
</li><li> In the same episode, when Heloise first makes the Accelerometer she shows Lucius a tape in which it is used as a whale magnet. At the end of the episode, Jimmy spits out the Accelerometer and throws it at someone who is promptly crushed by a whale.

Not only that, John Edward <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">wins</a></em>, much to his dismay. The episode's other example is the series of spoof trailers based on movies starring Rob Schneider. Another one at the very end of the episode reveals that Rob Schneider accidentally got possessed by Kenny.
</li><li> In "You're Getting Old", there's a joke where Stan can't tell the difference between a turd in a microwave and an ad for Kevin James's <em>Zookeeper</em>. In the following episode, at the very end, Stan's friends ask him to come watch a movie together. Guess which one it is a sequel of.

In the second season, it's revealed that he meant Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker. This is a rare example of a Chekhov's Gag spanning seasons. An <em>actual</em> 12-year-old girl riding a donkey also appears to him in a dream once.

He rejects the option of getting shock absorbers for it and the matter is apparently forgotten as the episode's main plots of Amy and Fry's relationship (and aftermath) and Bender's attempt at being a paid matchmaker take over. Then at the very end of the episode Fry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralAssKicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralAssKicking">accidentally kicks Bender's ass</a>, which promptly explodes.
</li><li> The 1979 Nelvana short <em>Intergalactic Thanksgiving</em> featured one amusing gag. On the planet Laugh-A-Lot, where humor was the norm, King Gucci was attempting to perform the planet's biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PieInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PieInTheFace">Pie in the Face</a> gag on a waiting courtier. The ceiling opened to reveal the huge pie, but it wouldn't drop. Fast forward about halfway through the short, when his oracle basically tells him his humor (and thus his throne) was being upstaged by a family of <em>boring space farmers</em>, he pulls the cord one more time in frustration. You start to hear the sound of something falling. The King then runs into the courtier...still standing there waiting for the punchline. Gucci looks up... Cue giant SPLAT!

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">Janna</a>'s appearances in Mewni in the show's final season is regularly lampshaded, as she shouldn't have the means to travel to Mewni from Earth (or dimension hop in general). It's only towards the end of the season, when the usual means of inter-dimensional travel is rendered impossible, that characters now care very deeply about how she got to Mewni. Searching for the answer leads to the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Earth is linked to Mewni via the Magic Realm, of which one portal to exists underneath Marco and Janna's hometown. This comes with the additional reveal that Mewmans are just humans who stumbled across the well centuries prior, having lost their memory of the journey due to the Magic Realm's mind-altering effects.</span>
