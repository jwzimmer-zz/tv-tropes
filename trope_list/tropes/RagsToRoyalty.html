That much is certain, what varies is <em>how</em> she goes from Rags to Royalty. The following is a non-exhaustive list of common variations:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> Style:</strong> A commoner by birth, or with only minor ties to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">nobility</a>. Nonetheless, through hard work, perseverance, and the help of some musical animals, she'll swoop into the ball and make the prince her "husband". Other classics of this type: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">King David</a></em>
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a> Style:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Legitimately royalty</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive">forced into hiding</a> to escape those who plot against her or because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">she cannot act as she needs to as long as she is seen as royal</a>. Usually part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> plot as she tries to hide her royalty and fake being a commoner. May have to prove birthright with bizarre tests or special trinkets only the legitimate Princess would have. Other classics of this type: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessAndThePea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessAndThePea">The Princess and the Pea</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonkeySkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonkeySkin">Donkey Skin</a>".

Of course, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">Genre Blind</a> guardians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">feel she's safer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">not knowing</a> her ancestry <em>or</em> that there are evil forces seeking to harm her, or possibly they don't know either. You can guess how that ends. (<em>Note: Named after the Disney version of the story only.</em>) The classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> version is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>. It also features in such fairy tales as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDancingWaterTheSingingAppleAndTheSpeakingBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDancingWaterTheSingingAppleAndTheSpeakingBird">The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird</a></em>
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingThrushbeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingThrushbeard">King Thrushbeard</a> Style:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">A spoiled royal daughter who loses her inheritance due to her own actions</a> and is forced to live in poverty. Fortuitously, when she comes to realize the value of what she lost, it is restored to her. Often as part of her humiliation she marries a commoner, who turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a> whom she had previously scorned.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGooseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGooseGirl">The Goose Girl</a> Style:</strong> Those who plotted against the princess succeed, and she is forced into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenOnHardTimesJob">a menial position</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">enslaved</a>, until her story comes out. Usually, the princess knows who she is, but isn't able to tell the truth, and she may be ignorant.

</li><li> A common technique is to combine this with Cinderella. The heroine wins the prince, perhaps even marries him and has his child; then her enemies triumph over her, and she must flee until she is restored. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrideAndSwitch">Bride and Switch</a> is also common, just before the wedding. Such a combination occurs in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/cinderella/stories/birch.html">The Wonderful Birch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> and <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/armlessmaiden/index.html">The Maiden Without Hands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>The Hard Way:</strong> becoming royalty by going through such intermediate stages as "mercenary", "field commander", "warlord" and "conqueror". It never appeared in fairy tales, but is very common in heroic epics. Naturally, this is a predominantly male path.
</li></ul><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>, and has long since gone into being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> when used in a serious application. However, sweeten the deal with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> or other device, and this will work quite well in a modern setting.
</p><p>Epidemic in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tale</a>, it often reappears in retellings of fairy tales. This is a common reason why kings who have promised the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward">Standard Hero Reward</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">decide instead</a> to assign another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">Engagement Challenge</a>, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">another</a>. And another. . . (This is usually very unwise in the long run.)
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenBasicPlots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenBasicPlots">Christopher Booker</a> takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> version for his second plot, <em>Rags to Riches</em>. According to his scheme, the hero seems to get everything he wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">very early</a>, only to lose it through a serious character flaw, which leads to the darkest moment for the hero (e.g., in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>, when the villain had stolen both the lamp <em>and</em> the princess). Then, of course, the hero manages to face his flaws and gets an even better prize than the one he would have been content with early on.
</p><p>Due to social expectations/gender double standards, male versions of this trope are rarer (especially ones involving a romance between a rich woman and a poorer man), but do exist in fiction and real-life.
</p><p>May combine with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather">Lineage Comes from the Father</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Usagi/Serena is a Sleeping Beauty, being a reincarnated princess with the forces that destroyed her kingdom hot on her heels. She does find out the bad guys are after her early on, but not that she's a princess until late in the first season/arc.
</li><li> Her boyfriend/future husband Mamoru is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> Sleeping Beauty, he eventually finds out he was heir apparent to the Earth Kingdom back in the past.
</li><li> And in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>, <em>all</em> the main senshi are Sleeping Beauties, former princesses of their respective planets. (Except Pluto, who is probably closer to a Snow White since she never lost her memories of the Silver Millennium, and spent her time guarding the Door of Time.)
</li><li> Chibiusa is a Snow White type, coming back in time to before her mother rose to power to receive senshi training and having to live like a civilian with Usagi and her family. Subverted in the sense that the senshi already know she's a princess. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After all, she's Mamoru and Usagi's future daughter, though they don't learn that detail until later.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a reasonably clever subversion in the anime. From the start we're expected to figure out that Mashiro isn't the real princess - meanwhile, the main character, Arika, conspicuously has the same birthday and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket">prerequisite necklace</a> and all. But as it turns out, that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, and in fact, it's Nina, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Rival Turned Evil</a>, who unbeknowst to all was the princess. The scene in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Nagi finds out is <em>priceless</em>. Ultimately thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, Mashiro turns out to be the one best suited to be a princess anyway. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtomeZwei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtomeZwei">Mai-Otome Zwei</a></em> hints that Mashiro <em>might</em> be a legit heir after all — she <em>greatly</em> resembles the Queen of Windbloom from 300 years ago.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiOtome">manga</a> has a good subversion as well. The "Mashiro" we know in the story is an impostor for the real (deceased) Mashiro, that was clear from the first chapter.

Deconstructed somewhat in the sequels, where noble and foreign disapproval of her commoner upbringing sets the plot in motion.
</li><li> Also from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydAlexander">Lloyd Alexander</a> are Taran and Princess Eilonwy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain">The Chronicles of Prydain</a></em>. Eilonwy is an aversion of the Snow White in that she isn't on the run from her royal lineage, but was stolen as an infant. She's somewhat of a Goose Girl, in that she is perfectly well aware that she's a Princess of Llyr, but when she meets protagonist Taran in the first book, she doesn't bother to mention it at any point — not because she feels like she needs to hide the truth, but simply because <em>rank doesn't matter to her</em>. (This is averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron">animated adaptation</a>, where she always introduces herself as a princess.) Taran himself, by the end of the series, is a Cinderella who makes a very abrupt transition from assistant pig-keeper to High King.

He's the heir to <em>two</em> dynasties (one a dynasty and people without a proper state, the other a land without a king), lives with his identity hidden for safety reasons, and was kept ignorant of his heritage during his childhood in Rivendell (which was nowhere near "rags" territory). As an adult he takes on the leadership of his people, and spends most of his time away from home fighting the horrors of the Enemy, whether to protect unwitting hobbits and Men in Eriador or as leader in the armies of Rohan and Gondor under the name Thorongil. Additionally, his line has been living this way for more than a dozen generations before their kingdom is finally restored. Aragorn's early life is a lot like that of King Arthur, who was placed for adoption by Merlin to keep him hidden and safe from his enemies until he could claim his throne.

Oh, and she <em>murdered</em> the princess who humiliated her by using magic, part for revenge for being tripped and part to force her daughter to marry the widower.

The Jedi Consular steps up to represent a minor house of nobility at a peace conference, and a Dark Side choice can net them a title of "Lord of Alderaan" by ruining one of the rival houses.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series has version of this. Any army not led by a general will be led by a generic default captain. If that army wins an epic battle and the captain survives, he may be adopted into the ruling family. From there, depending on the specific game in the series, he may either be named the Faction Heir directly by the player or will need the right combination of family members ahead of him in line for the throne to die. In either case, when the current Faction Leader dies, he will be named the new Faction Leader.

<ul><li> Technically, she is royalty: her first important ancestor drank pure mana from the Fountain of the Goddess (in this world, drinking mana kills most people from the neural strain) and lived. The head priestess declared him the consort of the goddess, possibly married him, and ever since all the heterodynes have the power to drink from one of the only sources of pure mana and live. Jaegers gain their superpowers by drinking a diluted, processed version of the mana, which says a lot about the claim to divine right.

Lindesfarne (the adopted daughter of Kevin) is believed to be the lost heir of the British throne. Determined to get the paparazzi off her back, she seeks out and finds Chertsey, another hedgehog that was in the orphanage the same time as her. Finding her through her handprints and a police record, Lindesfarne gets paparazzi-in-training Fiona to leak out that Chertsey might be the lost heir. DNA tests prove that Lindesfarne was the actual heir, but she conspired to put Chertsey in her place because it made a better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRoyalty">Rags to Royalty</a> story and she wanted to stay with her family. <br/><br/>And <em>here</em> is where it gets interesting. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out years later that Chertsey's DNA matches Lindesfarne's...because Domain runs parallel to a universe where humans are the dominant species, and every animal in Domain has a counterpart in the human world, proven because if they cross over, they turn into their counterpart, DNA match and all. Lindesfarne, it turns out, originated from the human world and crossed over to Domain as a baby by accident, making her Chertsey's counterpart. So in short, <em>both</em> Lindesfarne and Chertsey are Sleeping Beauty types. Not that Lindesfarne ever intends to go back to the human world or stake her claim-she'd much rather be a scientist.</span>

</li><li> King Rama IV of Thailand (you know, from <em>The King and I</em>) spent twenty-seven years in a monastery after he was passed over for his father's throne in favor of his older half-brother. He was a devout monk who insisted on strict observance of the Southern School Buddhist monastic rules, which included things like chastity, moderation and poverty (a Buddhist monk is permitted a small number of robes, a begging bowl, a fan and very little else.) Upon the death of his half-brother he became king, and inherited a whole load of palaces, servants and concubines.

</li><li> King Charles XIV John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NotableSwedishMonarchs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NotableSwedishMonarchs">of Sweden</a> was born as Jean Bernadotte and came from a lower-middle class family in Pau, France. He joined the army early on so his widowed mother would have one less mouth to feed, rose quickly through the ranks following the French revolution, and eventually became Marshall of France under emperor Napoleon, the 1st Sovereign Prince of Ponte Corvo and also married Napoleon's ex-fiancee Désirée Clary. Later on, because of a number of strange circumstances, he was adopted by the childless king of Sweden, made successor, ushered in a 200+ year period of peace, and founded the house of Bernadotte which still rules Sweden to this day. His last words were: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope">Nobody has had a career like mine.</a>"
<ul><li> Also of Swedish royalty, but of a later stripe: Prince Daniel, spouse of Crown Princess Victoria, was born in a rural Swedish town as the son of a social worker and a postal employee.
</li><li> Daniel's mother in law, Queen Silvia, was also this; she was a hostess at the 1972 Summer Olympics, and it was there she met then-Crown Prince Carl Gustaf. Carl, as he explained in an interview, just "clicked" with Silvia, and four years later they were engaged; when they married the next year, Carl was already king, so Silvia skipped the princess role, going straight to Queen.

</li><li> King Jaja of Opobo in what is today coastal Nigeria was born the son of peasant farmers further inland in the 1800s. He was kidnapped and sold as a slave to King Pepple of Bonny. He eventually ran the king's trading business so well that Pepple freed him, and made him Chief of his own War Canoe House. Later, Jaja led a group of disenchanted War Canoe Houses in a trade war with the town. They left Bonny, founded another port town, Opobo, and Jaja was proclaimed its first King. His War Canoe House is still the ruling House in Opobo today. (Jaja himself later got into a trade dispute with the British over rights to buy palm oil from the hinterland, was abducted, imprisoned in England, and died off the Gold Coast on his way back home).
</li><li> Every biography of a famous conqueror is this. Many times it is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic">epic</a> rather then strictly based on truth.
</li><li> Theodora, the daughter of a bear trainer and a dancer/actress in 6th century Constantinople, went from prostitute to empress of the Byzantine Empire through her marriage to Justinian I.
<ul><li> Justinian himself was born a Thracian peasant and engineered the rise of his uncle to the throne before inheriting it himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Basil I, founder of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, was born to Armenian peasant parents and eventually became Emperor, proving to be competent enough to establish his dynasty.
</li><li> Temujin was born to Mongol nobility, but was driven into exile with his mother and for a time he was even enslaved by his family's enemies. He later conquered most of the world, making him an extremely successful Sleeping Beauty type. For the non-scholarly types, you might know him as Genghis Khan.
</li><li> The Roman Emperor Diocletian, was born to parents who were former slaves (some sources even say he himself was born a slave). After joining the Roman Army, he eventually climbed the ranks to become one of the emperor's top generals. After the death of both the emperor and his son during a battle in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. He would go on to make reforms that would bring the Roman Empire out of the Crisis of the Third Century.
<ul><li> While Diocletian was an extreme case, the office of Roman Emperor <em>technically</em> was not hereditary, as the emperor was elected by the Senate. The situation of being <em>de facto</em> hereditary came from the reigning emperor's ability to force the Senate to elect a chosen heir as a co-emperor, who at his death would automatically become the only emperor. But, sometimes, the emperor would pick a competent general and have <em>him</em> elected as successor.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em>not</em> exactly royalty, more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Roman Catholic Pope</a> started his life in poverty or as mere middle-class and ended up as the highest authority in Catholicism. Some examples are: St. Pius X (Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">Country Mouse</a> and son of a post office worker in a tiny village), Saint John XXIII (Angelo Roncalli, doubling as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">Country Mouse</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">Impoverished Patrician</a> since his sharecropper family descended from a secondary noble branch) and Saint John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla, son of a Polish ex-military officer, thus as much urban middle-class).
<ul><li> The actual Pope (as of 2014), Francis, is one of these too. Son of Italian immigrants who lived in Argentina, graduated from schoool with a chemistry diploma and worked as a chemical technician, a bar bouncer and a janitor before entering the Jesuit Order and ascending in the hierarchy until he was made Pope.
</li></ul></li><li> Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark began her life as an accounts manager for several advertising agencies, and later a realtor specializing in luxury properties. Cue the Sydney Olympics, Crown Prince Frederik and a pub, and let the fairytale begin.
</li><li> Emperor Hongwu, founder of the Ming Dynasty of China, was born as a peasant, lived as a beggar after a plague wiped out his family, and spent some time as a monk before becoming a warlord and eventually emperor.
</li><li> Liu Bang, founder of the Han dynasty, was also born as a peasant.
</li><li> Qutb al-Din Aibak, founder of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk_Dynasty_(Delhi)">Malmuk Dynasty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that started the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India, was sold into slavery as a child. He eventually came into the possession of Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad, Sultan of the larger Ghurid Empire. Quṭb was initially put in charge of royal stables or Amir-i-Akhur. Eventually, Quṭb was appointed to military command and became a general to his owner, Muʿizz al-Dīn Muḥammad. When Muʿizz al-Dīn was assassinated in 1206, Quṭb al-Dīn was his logical successor. He was still technically a slave, but he quickly obtained manumission. He married the daughter of Tāj al-Dīn Yildiz of Ghazna, one of the other principal claimants to succeed Muʿizz al-Dīn, and, by other judiciously arranged marriages, consolidated his rule.
<ul><li> The dynasty he founded was eventually called a Dynasty of Slaves (<em>Mamluk</em> literally means Slave, and the dynasty was known as the <em>Ghulam Garh</em> - The House of Slaves) as <em>every</em> ruler who came after him was either a slave, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornIntoSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornIntoSlavery">or the child of one.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> A lower-class woman named Martha was born ca. 1684, became the maid of a Protestant cleric in Livonia, before marrying a Swedish dragoon. When the town she lived in was conquered by the Russians, she first lived with the Czar's friend Menshikov before becoming Peter the Great's mistress. Peter persuaded her to join the Orthodox church under the name Yekaterina (Catherine) and, after she had given birth to three daughters, she married him in 1712. When Peter died, she became Russia's first reigning empress, Catherine I.
</li><li> It was somewhat common for Sultans and other Muslim kings to elevate their favorite concubine to a de-facto Queen status. i.e, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s Slavic concubine <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxelana">Roxelana<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> became both his favorite consort <em>and</em> advisor.

Of course, this is usually played with, because of his commoner origin, he could only apply for 'royalty' position as high as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">kampaku</a>, not Shogun, since actual ancestry from past royal family was required. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> did that particular Shogun part better.
</li><li> The Bonaparte family, including Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law. The Bonapartes were impoverished Corsican aristocrats (making them foreigners in the eyes of the traditional French aristocracy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24fte');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24fte" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24fte');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Strictly speaking, Corsica was Genoese territory mortgaged to France pending the repayment of Genoa's debts to France - not that there was a realistic chance of Genoa ever raising the necessary cash - and only legally became part of France through a decree of the National Assembly during the French Revolution.</span>) before Napoleon rose to the throne of France, while Murat was the son of an innkeeper - and mostly got his crown because he married Caroline, the youngest of the Bonaparte siblings.
</li><li> After the death of her first husband, the elderly Earl of Gloucester, Edward I's daughter Joan of Acre secretly married a household squire (who may also have been illegitimate), Ralph de Monthermer. Edward threw Ralph in jail once he found out (when Joan had to explain why the new marriage he'd arranged for her couldn't go through), but after he was released he was made the Earl of Gloucester for Joan's lifetime.
</li><li> Similiar to Kate Middleton is Michiko Shoda, now known as Empress Emerita Michiko of Japan. Born into a wealthy but common family, she met the then Crown Prince Akihito at a tennis match and they soon fell in love. The media even portrayed their meeting as a "real fairy tale" and a "romance on the tennis court". Michiko became the first woman from outside of the traditional aristocracy to marry a future emperor. Their marriage wasn't a complete fairy tale, however; traditionalists, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">Akihito's mother</a> opposed their marriage, both because of her common status and the fact that her family was Roman Catholic, to the point she was temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> to Brussels, in hopes the relationship would dissolve and her family received death threats. Despite this, they also had plenty of support by the public and the marrage was seen as a sign of Japan's modernization and democratization.
<ul><li> Her daughters-in-law, Masako, The Empress of Japan and Kiko, Princess Akishino, are also examples of this trope. The former met her husband through Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo during a tea session while she was still a student at the University of Tokyo and the latter met her husband while both were students at Gakushuin University, with him proposing to her three times before she accepted. Likewise, neither are from a noble background and both have faced media and Imperial House Agency strife over Masako not producing a male heir to succeed the throne and Kiko living in an apartment on campus with her family before her marriage.
