Often, the person doing the punishing doesn't have an exceptional reason, or just has a sense that the teen is out of control and needs to calm down (or that the younger character has misbehaved or otherwise did something wrong). So they restrict the youngster's social life for a time by banning them from leaving the house and/or having friends over. Of course, if the character is of school age and the grounding takes place during term time, chances are they will be allowed out to go to school - unless they have also been suspended or expelled.
</p><p>The punished character usually sneaks out the window or similarly blows off the punishment to finish off the story. After the story is completed, the grounding or suspension is never mentioned again. Similarly, if a character is grounded at the <em>end</em> of an episode, you can expect that in the next episode, said grounding will no longer be in effect, or mentioned at all.

He always gets grounded, unlike in the Japanese version where he gets sent out of the house by his mom (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Doraemon is occasionally grounded along with him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, in a filler episode in the Frieza Saga, Chi-Chi tries to invoke this to Gohan when she was speaking to him through the monitor when he was in Namek when the planet was going to explode, after the latter ignored her and Master Roshi's questions when they were talking to him (it was justified, as he had no time to answer their questions). Chi-Chi does apologize for yelling at him and ungrounds him in the next episode though.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Nico once grounded Molly for apparently wandering off after a battle and supposedly making up a story about being kidnapped (she actually <em>had</em> been kidnapped after her powers caused her to fall asleep, but her adventure was so bizarre that Nico didn't believe it.)

Towards the end of the episode, her parents, who she claims grounded her for her and Fry accidentally destroying a cardboard high school, tell her to go with her friends, to which she replies "No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">The shot changes</a> to her climbing out the window of her room, saying "Until she sneaks out."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> U.S. Acres episode "Holiday Happening", Orson runs behind the barn after he hears a loud splatter. Orson asks what they have to say for themselves. After the boys explain, Orson thinks that what they did was so out of hand that he punishes them, which meant no TV, stories around the campfire or pistachio nuts for a month. To get revenge for this, Roy and Wade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">write to Congress</a> in order to create a new holiday, "Paint A Pig Purple Day". The episode ends with them chasing Orson while carrying cans of purple paint.
</li><li> Invoked in the second season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, when Grunkle Stan grounds Dipper for disobeying him and trying to contact government agents about the weirdness in the town. However, the grounding never takes effect when zombies attack and Stan is forced to admit that he knew about the weird goings-on all this time and was trying to protect the kids. This is notable for being the only time in the series that Stan acts like a disciplinarian.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Tick, Tick, Tick", Kim gets detention for being late to class. She escapes twice: once when Mr. Barkin evacuates the room after mistaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Rufus</a> for a mutant escapee from the science lab, and once when she realizes that Drakken's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb">nano-tick</a> is stuck to her and she runs off to get it removed before it detonates.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">"October 31st"</a>, Kim's grounded at the end of the episode (shortly before Ron gave Josh the other half of his horse costume) after her parents found out that she'd lied to get out of trick-or-treating with Ron so she could go to a party instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Occasionally happens to Bobby in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, notably at the end of "The Buck Stops Here", where Hank grounds him for the rest of the Summer after all the chaos with Buck Strickland at a poker game. Unlike most examples however, Bobby actually takes it in stride.
<ul><li> Another example occurs in "Yard She Blows", when Peggy accuses Bobby of breaking her gnome despite Hank's pleas to the contrary and grrounds him to his room for a week. It gets lifted early after Hank buys another gnome and mistakens this as a sign of gratitude from him despite it being Bobby's idea.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></em>, Ariel and one of her sisters are "beached" for a week after disobeying Triton on something important.

<ul><li> In the episode "Sleuth or Consequences", Lincoln and his sisters are grounded for supposedly clogging the toilet until the perpetrator is found out. With his trip to the comic book convention in jeopardy, Lincoln along with his goth younger sister Lucy decide to go around the house to find out who the culprit is. Lucy later admits to Lincoln she was the one responsible for clogging the toilet with the "Princess Pony Book" she reads in the bathroom late at night and she hides the book in the toilet when Lincoln comes in and flushes the book down without knowing. Feeling sorry for Lucy and not wanting her to become a laughing stock to her sisters for reading the book, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat">Lincoln decides to take the blame for Lucy</a>, resulting in Lincoln getting grounded and the girls being ungrounded, forgoing his chances of going to the convention. Lucy later cheers up Lincoln by drawing him a creepy comic book as thanks for helping her.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happens to Marinette in the episode "Simon Says", when her parents find out about her many unexcused absences due to her secret heroics. This causes her to have to sneak out to help stop an Akuma attack. In a rarity for this trope, her sneaking out is never discovered and the grounding is lifted after a week when she avoids missing class, due to both her parents fitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> trope.
</li><li> Although he's never formally grounded or punished, elements of this trope frequently happen to Marinette's co-lead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorLittleRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorLittleRichKid">Adrien Agreste</a>. His stern, overprotective father likes to keep him confined to home where bodyguards watch him so he'll be safe, so Adrien is frequently forced to sneak out to operate as Chat Noir.

<ul><li> In "Stumped!" adoptive siblings Shimmer and Squirt were "stumped" — forced to sit on a tree stump and not allowed to leave until they resolved the argument they were having. Once they did, they started having fun with each other and had so much fun that they decided not to leave the stump for the time being.
</li><li> In "Fungus Among Us," Wiggle figures that he'll be grounded after admitting having brought a mushroom into the Hollow Tree, the result of which being spores spread everywhere and a bunch of mushrooms growing. He is instead sentenced to help in the ongoing chore of cleaning Sunny Patch of mushrooms.
</li></ul></li><li> A few times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a></em>.

<ul><li> In "The Secret of Success," when Candace attempts to show Linda the ATV, she mentions she was driving it which causes Linda to assume she drove a car without adult supervision, resulting in her being punished.
</li><li> Later, in "Candace Gets Busted," Candace ends up, well, busted for the intimate get-together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, Angelica is grounded for having drawn over several important prints from her father. She's unable to accept the punishment, so she decides to escape from her house. She learns this isn't a good idea.
</li><li> "All Grown Up": Tommy spends time in his room for stealing his dad's medallion (Stu's using it for disco dancing, Tommy's using it to get picked onto stage at a concert).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>: Played with in the pilot as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">Queen Angella</a> upbraids one of her military commanders for taking unnecessary risks in a mission and endangering the troops. She enumerates the commander's sins, rises to deliver the punishment, and thunders "You're grounded!". The commander is her teenage daughter Glimmer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: In the episode, "Postcards from the Wedge", Bart Simpson is grounded after causing the school to be demolished. Now this was a first for the series as a whole, due to the fact that usually Bart is sent to his room, or punished in other, different manners. The only time Bart really was grounded was in the comic book story, "When Bongo's Collide". But this episode marks the first time this trope was acted upon and stood for the rest of the episode, as we see Bart suffer from this punishment in the episode's final scene. It would remain the last grounding in the series, until Season 27's "The Marge-ian Chronicles", where Lisa Simpson would be grounded for the first time ever.
<ul><li> Homer attempts to do this with regard's to Bart's shoplifting in Season 7's "Marge Not Be Proud", but his punishment (which included no leaving the house, not even for school, no egg nog and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">absolutely no stealing for three months</a>) leaves a lot to be desired, and it turns out he was just doodling a robot barbequeing a wiener the whole time.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>, Wendell is grounded for stealing all the flying horses in "Minimus is Missing" and also punished to no dessert for a week, no crystal ball-gazing for two weeks and spending the rest of his day cleaning out the cauldrons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> An extremely common fate for Butters, and one that scares him more than even worse consequences. Especially in earlier seasons, he would be grounded for things that he either had nothing to do with, or were so minor it didn't warrant a grounding, but his parents are incredibly abusive, and worst of all, believe that they're Parent of the Year material. In more recent seasons, Butters is only grounded when he actually does something reprehensible, such as pressing his penis against a glass door, or using Facebook to spread misinformation. Otherwise, his parents have become much nicer.
</li><li> Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman will also go to absurd lengths to avoid being grounded: for example, in "Butt Out," they decide that getting swept up in a battle between big tobacco and anti-smoking activists and facing down a torch-and-pitchfork wielding mob would be less trouble than getting grounded for three weeks.
</li><li> There's also "Fun With Veal", where Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters (Kenny had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> at this point) rescue baby cows and hid them in Stan's house, then eventually resort to terrorism to get their way. It led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> — they got the word "veal" renamed to "little tortured baby cow", but they end up grounded anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Their parents still offer to go out for some hamburgers first</a>.
</li><li> Also used in the movie. Remember the Mole: "You realize that by doing zis, we could be grounded for two, maybe even three weeks."
</li><li> Also used in the Coon Trilogy, Cartman is grounded and sent to his room by his mother at the end of "Coon 2: Hindsight" for beating up his friends, but is eventually ungrounded at the beginning of "Coon vs. Coon and Friends" after he convinces his mother by using the "Lebron James" trick on her.
</li><li> Also in the Black Friday trilogy episode "Titties and Dragons": Cartman gets Stan grounded after he takes a dump in his neighbors yard and puts the blame on Stan to prevent him from warning Princess Kenny and his followers about the Red Robin wedding trap to lock them in so Cartman and his followers can get Xbox Ones during Black Friday.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:

</li><li> Steven is grounded again near the end of "Fusion Cuisine" for trying to elope with Connie, with no dinner for 1000 years (Pearl realized this was too far since Steven needs food while the Gems don't, and then changed the punishment to just no TV...for 1000 years). The punishment is active and brought up many episodes later, until it's finally lifted in "Joy Ride".
</li></ul></li><li> The third short in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever">Super Best Friends Forever</a></em> has Supergirl grounded and Batgirl and Wonder Girl try to bail her out. Problem? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Her Cousin of Steel</a>. And his mother.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo">Teamo Supremo</a></em> has the title heroes getting grounded and luring the latest villain in town to Crandall's house where they ambush him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Gorilla", Robin attempts to ground Beast Boy after he becomes disobedient from deciding that as a gorilla he doesn't need to follow any of Robin's rules. Beast Boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">calls Robin out on his pathetic attempt at using child psychology on him</a>.

Sir Topham Hatt gave up, and grounded Henry by hiring construction workers to take out the rails and build a brick wall over the tunnel's entrance. No other train engines would bump into Henry. Now Henry was sad and miserable (he believed he would never see green paint and yellow stripes again!) Toned down a little in the US version, where Henry is bricked up until he's "ready to come out of the tunnel."
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Narrator:</a></strong> Now all that Henry can do is watch the trains go by the other side of the tunnel. He was very sad, because he believed nobody will never see his green paint and red stripes again. As time went on, Edward and Gordon would often pass by. Edward would say, <br/><strong>Edward:</strong> PEEP-PEEP! Hello! <br/><strong>Narrator:</strong>....and Gordon would say, <br/><strong>Gordon:</strong> Poop-poop-poop! Serves you right! <br/><strong>Narrator:</strong> Poor Henry had no steam to answer. His fire had gone out. Soot and dirt from the tunnel had spoilt his lovely green paint with red stripes, anyway. He wondered if he would ever be let out to pull trains again. But I think he deserved his punishment, don't you?
</div></li><li> Happens about two times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> The first is where Clover ended up grounded due to a violated late curfew (due to a mission). She manages to sneak out thanks to a WHOOP gadget that displays holograms. The second was in a movie where the girls' moms forbid their spy work after discovering their secret. Doesn't help that a brainwashed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Mandy</a> and her friends are trying to kill them at the time.
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Turbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Turbo">Turbo</a> FAST</em>: In "Deuce is Wild", when Turbo sees Deuce and Edvard committing petty debauchery he tells Deuce that he's grounded, but Deuce is quick to point out Turbo doesn't have the authority to punish him because he isn't his father...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">but then says that he can become his father if he wants to</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleGrandpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UncleGrandpa">Uncle Grandpa</a></em> episode "Grounded", a boy is locked in his room for a week and tricks Uncle Grandpa into letting him out to go hang with his friends in a forest. Uncle Grandpa promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">scares him straight</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>:
<ul><li> This happens to Will <em>all the time</em>, as her mom gets stricter as the series goes on. Because the series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArc">arc-based</a>, Will's groundings usually carry over between episodes, to the point where by about the mid-point of season one, she's perpetually grounded. Seeing as how the consequence of staying home (the girls' powers depend on Will being there to transform them) are nothing less than <em>the end of the world</em>, Will usually just sneaks out of her room anyway, accepting the consequences of being grounded as an unfortunate consequence of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">great responsibility as a heroine</a>.
</li><li> Happens also in the original comics where it's happened to all of the girls at least once, sometimes because of legitimate reasons and other times because they can't explain their super-heroing to unsuspecting parents. Taranee got her own grounding in season 2 of the show because her mother didn't like her boyfriend and suspected she was involved in his buddies' pranks (she wasn't), and this outraged her so much that she snuck out to meet him just to spite her mother.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em>:
<ul><li> In an episode, the main character's parents hire a babysitter who just happens to be one of the villains—Granny May. Granny May quickly sends Becky and her brother straight to bed, then sneaks out to commit her crimes, hoping to use babysitting as her alibi. Becky suspects she's up to no good and transforms into WordGirl, chasing after Granny May. However, every time Becky's brother leaves his room, a sensor that Granny May had placed goes off, causing BOTH the hero and the villain to have to race back to the house and pretend as if they had been where they were supposed to be the entire time.
</li><li> Another episode featured her being grounded by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>, who was surprisingly competent at keeping her in her room, forcing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick">Non-Human Sidekick</a> to have to save the day.
</li><li> In the two-parter "Dinner or Consequences," Becky gets "mega-grounded" after missing two of her father's special dinners. This means that not only does she get sent to her room, but her room has been wiped of all her favorite things and she's basically not allowed to go anywhere or do anything fun.
