</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a>, as applied to parenthood. Couples who want to have children will have trouble not only conceiving, but adopting and using surrogates as well. People who don't want children, however, will be faced with unwanted pregnancies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom">even if they used birth control</a>, particularly if the conception was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">forced upon them</a>. In fact, the page image leaves out rape, which is about 200% (that's right, you'll probably have twins). Teenagers, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">will get pregnant their first time</a>, double points if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception">thought they couldn't</a>. The reason for this, of course, is obvious: "woman becomes pregnant with longed-for child immediately" and "woman doesn't want to get pregnant and doesn't" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">don't exactly make the most thrilling plotlines</a>. At least the woman with a baby she doesn't want can give it up to the woman who is desperate to conceive—but, expect much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">angst</a> along the way.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If it's the <em>man</em> who was reliably told he was infertile, expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe</a> to rear its head; to maximize the drama, usually the woman knows he's the father.
</p><p>In many cases the stress of trying to have a baby will suppress fertility, and, once the couple decides to adopt or give up, the stress disappears, and: hooplah! They have a baby! Sometimes it's <em>after</em> they went through the hassle of adopting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes">as if Mother Nature felt humorous one day</a>.
</p><p>Conversely, if an unexpectedly expecting woman starts warming up to the idea of being a mother, her chances of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">Convenient Miscarriage</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicStillbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicStillbirth">Tragic Stillbirth</a> double. Or it'll turn out that she was never pregnant in the first place. This particular trick is common on shows where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> and having a baby would spoil everything; whether the former or latter version is used depends on how much drama the writers wish to evoke. Even that much is assuming they let things get that far; some kind of pre-existing condition getting in the way of conception can be milked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a> as much as they want.

</p><p>One limited case where a woman who wants to get pregnant can do so — after one night, even — is if she is sneaking into the man's bed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a> because she is his wife. This may be because the man does not want her to become pregnant; it is often the condition he set on accepting her as his wife.
</p><p>This trope is very old; involuntary infertility is found in the opening of a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tales</a> before the birth of the main character, and just about required for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderChild">Wonder Child</a>.

And it only took their first time to get knocked up. Alas, things do not end well for them or their child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because of the Eclipse and what Griffith does to Casca in particular</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise has an uneven history with this trope. Trunks was apparently the result of a one-night stand between Bulma and Vegeta. And given the amount of time Goku spends either dead, traveling through space, training in the wilderness, or bedridden with a killer virus between and during the Freeza and Android / Cell sagas, it's amazing that he and Chichi ever found time to conceive Goten.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Goten was conceived in the ten-day span between the announcement of the Cell Games and Goku's second death.

She was then convinced that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed her child a second time when she attempted to transmute the child to life, though thankfully this was eventually shown to not be the case</span>. For this, her "divine punishment" from the Truth was to lose her uterus along with a few other organs, effectively making her infertile there on out <em>and</em> giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">her</a> a nasty mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">Incurable Cough of Death</a> plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which either kills her in the end (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a>) or is sorta healed by Ed and Al's father (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">manga and second anime</a>).</span>

</li><li> In the H-OVA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> of <em>Tokubetsu Byoutou</em> The head doctor has trouble having a child despite wanting one to continue her legacy. Complicating matters is that she is a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> and thus her body has never gone through menses and produces sperm of low-quality and low in quantity. She is able to eventually subvert the trope through medicine she created.
</li><li> Barely subverted by Issei's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em> as while they do conceive twice before Issei they aren't able to bring it to term due to Miki's poor constitution. They are told that it is quite possible that they would never be able to have a child only for Issei to be born.

<ul><li> When the Vision and the Scarlet Witch fell in love and married, they desperately wanted a child together despite the literal impossibility of that because the Vision is an android. Yet in the face of pretty much 0% odds, the Scarlet Witch so determined to make this happen that she was able to use magic and Mephisto's soul fragments (though she didn't know it at the time) to impregnate herself with twin sons that... were also 'equally Vision's' somehow. This appears to be a subversion of this trope in the face of all logic, but then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> ensues... only to wind right back to subverting it again when the Scarlet Witch gets her twin sons back again, via reincarnation.

She says no because their lives are too dangerous. A few years later she changes her mind...at which point they're informed that due to damage she had sustained during <em>Longbow Hunters</em>, she's not physically capable of having kids anymore.

They're not worried, because it happened once before, <em>last month</em>. God, these two are such <em>idiots</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Victor learns that his mother wanted a child but was infertile and unable to adopt because of her past as a drug mule. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She was so desperate that she ended up letting Ultron build Victor as a half robot/half human with her supplying the human genetic material.</span>

Shepard's mother abused drugs during her pregnancy, so Jane was born biotic but also infertile, which is a sore point for her when she marries Garrus; she sees herself as unable to give him a family.
<ul><li> Then the trope is averted during the events of [ME2], thanks to the Reaper techs used for her resurrection; Jane becomes pregnant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntoUsASonAndDaughterAreBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UntoUsASonAndDaughterAreBorn">two hybrids</a>, and despite the approaching war and the knowledge that their children won't be able to live in peace for what they are, the couple decide to go through with it and carry the two fetuses to term.
</li><li> Played straight again for the storyline of [ME3], after Jane volunteers herself as Mordin's test subject to create a specialized cure for the Genophage.

</li><li> Mentioned in the opening narration of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>, as King Stefan and his queen longed for many years to have a child. The wish was finally granted, but they only were able to keep Aurora for a very short time before they had to surrender her to the good fairies (to protect her from Maleficent), and so they effectively remained childless anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up">Up</a></em>: Subtly implied in the opening montage: a brief shot of Carl and Ellie in a doctor's office. There's a picture of a baby on the wall so presumably, it's her OB-GYN. Ellie is crying. It's especially heartbreaking since the buildup has Carl and Ellie making a room for the baby. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says it was a miscarriage that left Ellie unable to have more children. What we see is what little they could actually show/feel comfortable putting in a movie for their young target audience.

Ellie and Pete never tried conception, but eventually decide to take in three foster children, making them parents first. Ellie's sister then says that her example has inspired her and her husband to adopt as well (not only because it's cheaper, but that is a factor). The last scene of the movie is Ellie and Pete officially adopting Lizzie, Juan, and Lita, and the sister is in the audience holding hands with a young boy she's presumably fostering... while she's visibly pregnant.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaisingArizona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaisingArizona">Raising Arizona</a></em> uses this as the crux of its plot, where a married couple can neither conceive (because the wife is infertile) nor adopt (because the husband has a shaky, criminal history), so instead they opt to kidnap one of the recently-born Arizona quintuplets, since the father was quoted in the media as saying they had more children than they could handle.
<ul><li> This particularly fits the trope because the wife is absolutely <em>desperate</em> to have a child. When she finds out she can't, she's so depressed she quits the police force.

Not played for drama, as she marries the man anyway.</span> Played straight (justified) for most families who desire a boy child, though, as sperm quality is low, and male babies are frequently stillborn.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KhaledHosseini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KhaledHosseini">Khaled Hosseini</a> is very fond of his trope; he mainly does it to challenge the traditional, "childbearing" role of a woman in society.

She finally fakes a pregnancy and adopts the child of an unwed Italian girl, and about a year later becomes pregnant for real and has a healthy baby boy.
</li><li> <em>A Soldier of the Great War</em> references this trope. A young boy is talking to the protagonist about various fertility superstitions he's heard. Alessandro tells him that the real rule is "Once if you're not married; a thousand times if you are."
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babycakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babycakes">Babycakes</a></em> by Armistead Maupin, Brian desperately wants to have a child with Mary Ann. Mary Ann has secretly stopped taking her birth control because she wants to surprise him with a pregnancy, but months go by with nothing happening. After (somehow) having Brian's sperm tested and finding that he's basically infertile, Mary Ann conspires to spend a night with a friend of theirs, a British naval officer who looks remarkably similar to Brian. However, even this fails because the friend has had a vasectomy. At the end of the book, Mary Ann's friend Connie dies in childbirth and entrusts the baby to Mary Ann and Brian's care.

Justified as Shelena is a werewolf and in heat on that day. The sequel novella reveals that they indeed have a child.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk Series</a> implies that this is true for all angels: as a species, they are so absurdly fertile that many of them end up having a child after their first sex, and nothing helps them in that regard. Defied, though, with the main character: as a fertility witch, she can reduce her chances of getting pregnant to zero.
</li><li> A major part of Gordie's character in "The Body" (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> novella that later became the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandByMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandByMe">Stand by Me</a></em>): his late brother Denny was born after a series of miscarriages and stillbirths and regarded as a gift from God, while he came along ten years later, when his parents didn't want another child.

After Donte's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">fake</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFakedForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFakedForYou">death</a></span>, Candi meets Denny. They try to restrain themselves at first but eventually succumb. They have sex numerous times without incident. Then, after tricking Gunner in a fight to kill himself by falling on his own knife, Candi has sex with Denny again. And <em>this time</em>, gets pregnant.

Bernard, her husband, points out that not <em>every</em> blighted woman is infertile, so they resolve to keep trying until they get the child they desperately want (Repeatedly, and with much enthusiasm).

Rhys is the ruler and needs an heir. He's been married for years and his wife hasn't given him any children at all. His brother Rhodry isn't so burdened, has a way with the ladies, and accidentally gets a servant girl pregnant. Rhys, meanwhile, is forced by politics to cast off his wife for one who isn't barren and his cast-off wife is given to a widower with so many children, he needs a wife to mother them but doesn't need any more heirs. Within a year, Rhys's cast-off wife is pregnant and giving birth, causing everyone to realise that the infertile one is actually Rhys (nobles start whiling away their time by placing bets as to whether his second wife will ever get pregnant). Rhys tries to solve this problem by adopting Rhodry's illegitimate child as his legal heir, but he dies before he can go beyond considering it as a hypothetical solution.

Occasionally, the mating of two Imperials also results in a Celestial. Because of this interbreeding, Celestials are very similar in appearance to Imperials and share many common traits. It is not known whether Celestial/Imperial matings may produce Imperials, or even if Celestial/other breed matings may produce hybrid breeds, or are even viable in terms of fertility.

Cordelia, who's actually trying to have a baby with her husband, gets pregnant first go, while her friend Drou, in the midst of a pregnancy scare after an ill-judged encounter, is not. And then the <em>real</em> plot starts. Growing up, Miles is uncomfortably aware that his parents chose not to have more children, to protect their "mutie" son from being shunted aside.
<div class="indent"> Now, family <em>size</em>; that was the real, secret, wicked fascination of Barrayar. There were no legal limits here, no certificates to be earned, no third-child variances to be scrimped for; no rules, in fact, at all. She'd seen a woman on the street with not three but four children in tow, and no one had even started. Cordelia had upped her own imagined brood from two to three, and felt deliciously sinful, till she'd met a woman with ten. Four, maybe? Six?

Kylara, on the other hand, has no trouble conceiving and bearing children, and hates it - so much so that after five babies, she starts using trips <em>between</em> as birth control. In a later volume, Mirrim has trouble not conceiving but carrying, and it's because she's been going <em>between</em> before she learns she's pregnant; the dolphins, however, are able to identify a pregnant woman and this enables her to protect her unborn child.

As a part of a family curse, the Scarborough women end up pregnant at seventeen whether they want to or not. And it's not a magical pregnancy, either, since both Miranda and Lucy conceive when Padraig manipulates them into having sex when it looks like they won't of their own free will (and in Lucy's case, it's hinted that he tampered with the morning-after pill she was given). Meanwhile, it's mentioned that Soledad and Leo wanted a child of their own but were unable to conceive, which is one of the reasons Miranda decides to have them take care of her daughter when she fails her tasks and goes insane. It's subverted in <em>Unthinkable</em> when Fenella tells the circumstances behind her own pregnancy.

Since the family is Catholic, of course, they wouldn't <em>dream</em> of an abortion, which was illegal at the time anyway... but lots of scalding hot baths, many doses of castor oil, and large quantities of gin are attempted.

The ultimate fate of this pregnancy is unknown, as the series was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a>.
</li><li> Kevin and Scotty hire a friend to be a surrogate. They start running into problems like having difficulty with conception and eventual miscarriage. They then give up on that idea and adopt a 9-year-old girl, with whom they are happy. Later, they learn that their surrogate was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">lying about the miscarriage and took the baby for herself</a>. So they get the baby back, but then their adopted daughter's homophobic brother who abandoned her wants to take her away from them. He fails.
</li><li> While never directly stated onscreen, evidence suggests that Justin may also be sterile or have defective sperm. Despite years of casual sex, often influenced by drugs and alcohol, with many women, he has seemingly never fathered any children. The fact that Tommy and Julia's daughter Elizabeth is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyDNATest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyDNATest">confirmed to be</a> Kevin's biological child seems to support this. Justin later fathers a child on Rebecca, but she miscarries.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>. In season five's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, Kevin Ryan and wife Jenny decide to have a kid. Several episodes later Ryan shows up looking rather haggard from... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">repeated attempts</a>, and in a late-season episode, they go to see a fertility doctor for tests <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only to have it turn out they wasted their money because they already succeeded</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>:
<ul><li> After a year of marriage, Piper and Leo are trying to get pregnant, and Piper finds out that the physical toll of demon-fighting has made it "difficult if not impossible" for her to get pregnant. Meanwhile, Phoebe has been married for about a month and finds out that she's pregnant, despite not wanting children. (In this case, though, her husband — secretly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> — <em>was</em> trying to have a kid without her realizing it.) Phoebe's fear of telling Piper turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilhollandRelationshipMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilhollandRelationshipMoment">Milholland Relationship Moment</a>, and long story short, Phoebe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetusTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetusTerrible">Fetus Terrible</a> explodes and Piper winds up pregnant. (In fact, she eventually has two more kids, and the second, at least, is known to be an "accident.")
</li><li> When the sisters traveled back in time to the 1970s, they discovered that their mother was told she wouldn't be able to conceive again after Piper. She reveals this while already pregnant with Phoebe. It became almost comical when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">backstage shenanigans</a> necessitated revealing that Patty had a <em>fourth</em> child.
</li><li> Phoebe somehow found herself on <em>both</em> sides of this simultaneously in later seasons. After having had a pair of premonitions of herself as a mother, her major motivation is ensuring that they come true. She's constantly consulting various auguring methods and charts to see whether she's passed the conception date, and she actually lost her active powers via abusing them so as to not waste time with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> and find the child's father faster. But when she discovers she's pregnant in season 8, it's just after she's broken up with a man she accidentally married while using a magical fake identity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">it's a long story</a>), so it's still far from good news. <em>Then</em> it turns out that it was a false positive, so she goes right back to her star charts. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelInAnotherMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelInAnotherMedium">sequel comic</a> states that she finally got pregnant via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingEnhancedFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingEnhancedFertility">Wedding-Enhanced Fertility</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em>: in the season finale, Susan is desperate to conceive but is told the chances are low, while Sally has a pregnancy scare when she doesn't want a baby. Subverted as Susan finds out at the last minute that she's pregnant, and Sally isn't (Jane was also involved in the test mix-up and she was not pregnant).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em>, Gabrielle took a tumble down the stairs a few minutes after she accepted her pregnancy. When she later decided she wanted to try to have a baby, "complications" from the fall made her unable to do it the old-fashioned way. She and Carlos attempted to adopt a baby but were thwarted when an employee of the agency blabbed Gabrielle's history of statutory rape and Carlos' slave labor charges. They managed to adopt a child through the services of a private adoption lawyer but the biological mother had a change of heart and took the child back. Finally, they used a surrogate, and nine months later discovered there had been an embryo mix-up and the baby belonged to someone else.
<ul><li> In Season 5 we find out Gabby had <em>two</em> miracle pregnancies... right after her husband went blind and they lost all their money.
</li><li> Lynette gets pregnant at the end of Season 5, despite having just undergone chemo and being, judging by the age of her older children, well in her forties. Well, at least it gave occasion to one of the best lines of the season: "Are you sure it's not cancer?"
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DharmaAndGreg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DharmaAndGreg">Dharma &amp; Greg</a></em>, Dharma became convinced that she and Greg were about to have a baby after seeing a vision. They tried to have a baby for a long time, using various methods, but, in the end, it was Dharma's middle-aged mother who became pregnant. Dharma explained that her vision was correct, but that she just misplaced its womb.
</li><li> Played for drama on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E1AsylumOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E1AsylumOfTheDaleks">"Asylum of the Daleks"</a>. Due to her ordeal at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E7AGoodManGoesToWar">Demon's Run</a>, Amy learned that she couldn't have any more children. Knowing that Rory had always wanted children of his own, Amy decided to divorce him in the hopes that he could start over with someone who could give him the family she couldn't. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">"I didn't kick you out, Rory, I gave you up!"</a> Amy and Rory are a pretty good example of this trope since they (presumably) weren't trying to have kids when Amy got pregnant with Melody, but now, thanks to the events on Demon's Run, they wouldn't be able to have kids even if they wanted to (as Rory apparently does).
</li><li> Rampant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em>. The only woman on the show who actually gets pregnant without difficulty when she wants to is Sybil, and she ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">dying as a result</a>.
<ul><li> The second season presents with the housemaid Ethel, who has a few dalliances with an officer convalescing at Downton, resulting in her pregnancy.
</li><li> The third season gives us <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matthew and Mary</span>, married and trying, and failing. They both secretly go to a fertility specialist about it in London and run into each other there.
</li><li> In the fourth season, Edith spends one night with the man she's planning on marrying before he goes off to Germany to divorce his first wife and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets killed in the Beer Hall Putsch</span>, and ends up with an illegitimate daughter.
</li><li> The fifth season reveals that Anna and Bates have been trying unsuccessfully to have children for some time, leading to a sustained misunderstanding when Bates discovers the birth control paraphernalia that Anna has been hiding for Mary. (A trip to the same fertility specialist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matthew and Mary</span> visit finally allows her to carry a child to term.)
</li><li> There are two notable subversions in Season 4, however. The first is in the case of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anna's rape</span>. Following it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mrs. Hughes and Anna worry about the possibility of Anna becoming pregnant, with a very upset Anna threatening to kill herself if it turns out to be the case.</span> It isn't. The second is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edna gets Tom drunk and tries to get him to marry her by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTrap">heavily implying that she's pregnant with his child and he must marry her to take responsibility</a>. Tom very nearly gives in, until Mrs. Hughes investigates the matter and finds a book on birth control in Edna's room. Between that and the fact that Edna wouldn't want to be pregnant until knowing for <em>certain</em> if Tom was going to marry her, she concludes that Edna ensured she didn't get pregnant that night and was planning to find some other man to knock her up once Tom agreed. (After the whole thing was over, Mrs. Hughes then told Tom that even if Edna was pregnant, it would have been <em>way</em> too early even for her to know.)</span>

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, when Niles and Daphne are trying to have a child. Niles finds out that he has lethargic sperm and goes through a whole rigmarole of ridiculous procedures to increase chances of impregnating Daphne. He then finds out that she is already pregnant.

<ul><li> Lucienne gets pregnant by Kurt, when he says they had been taking care to <em>not</em> have it happen.
</li><li> Rita later also gets pregnant unintentionally by Jean.
</li></ul></li><li> Very much in effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: There are a lot of accidental and engineered pregnancies, but the two couples that desperately wanted children are the ones that are unable to conceive naturally.
<ul><li> It's only after Ross has divorced his wife, who had found out she was gay, that they both learn she's pregnant from one last fling they'd had at the end of their marriage. This is after them having been together for seven years (four of which they were married) without any baby coming along.
</li><li> Frank Jr. and Alice desperately want children, but can't, so they blindside Phoebe by asking her to be their surrogate. Only after she agrees does she learn how low the success rate actually is and that her brother only has one shot at this because it's so expensive. She ends up pregnant far faster than medical science predicted and with three of the five embryos that were implanted.
</li><li> Rachel did have a plan that involved meeting the right guy, dating him, getting engaged and then being married for a healthy period of time before having children. It didn't work out that way, and she became pregnant after a one-night stand with Ross just before Chandler and Monica's wedding. They'd even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom">taken precautions</a>, too.
</li><li> Monica was the one member of the gang who had wanted children from the earliest episodes and even lost one serious relationship because of her desire for children and her (older) partner's desire not to have any more. However, after she learns Chandler's more than ready to have children with her, they discover they each have fertility problems and that it'll be very unlikely that they could ever conceive naturally, making them the second couple that wants children but can't have them. They eventually adopt twins; the producers also revealed they view the couple as having a biological child post-show.
</li><li> Janice's first husband is not much of a family man at all but has no trouble having children with Janice. Janice's second husband, however, is a much better family man and desperately wants children, but has fertility issues, resulting in them needing medical help each time they want to have a child.
</li><li> Ross and Monica's parents were told they were incapable of having children - then Ross came along. It's cited as the reason for Monica being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a>. Ross was the miracle baby, while Monica was just another birth.

</li><li> On the other end of the scale it is a miracle that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Brittany</a> <em>hasn't</em> become pregnant. She has claimed to have had sex with almost every guy in the school and yet she thinks using protection means having a burglar alarm and additionally she still thinks babies come from the stork.
</li><li> There's also Shelby Corcoran, who after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> giving Rachel up to her fathers after she was paid to be their surrogate</span> is told she can no longer have children. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She finds her way around it by adopting Quinn's daughter.</span>

<ul><li> Addison cheats on her husband with Sloan, gets pregnant, aborts, and then when she tries to have a baby on her own finds out she's barren. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Addison later adopts a son.</span>
</li><li> Cristina gets pregnant by accident; it turns out to be ectopic and she miscarries before she can abort.
</li><li> Bailey, after 7 years of trying, gets pregnant right when she's about to become an attending.
</li><li> Adele gets pregnant at <em>age 50</em> while separated from her husband, only to miscarry once they've reconciled.
</li><li> Callie and George briefly talk about trying to have a baby which doesn't happen. Callie gets pregnant after sleeping with her best friend Sloan after a breakup with her girlfriend. Callie gets back together with Arizona and the three raise the baby together.
</li><li> Sloan knocked up some chick when he was young and dumb and his teenage daughter shows up in season six, <em>also</em> knocked up.
</li><li> Meredith gets pregnant, and though she is happy about it, she <em>was</em> on birth control... but then miscarries. She then spends all of season 7 trying to get pregnant, but she doesn't so they adopt a baby in season 8. The next season her and Derek are happy with Zola, only for her to get pregnant <em>again</em>. In season 11, Meredith finds herself pregnant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shortly after Derek is killed in a car accident.</span>
</li><li> And then Cristina gets knocked up, AGAIN, despite only having one functional Fallopian tube, and desperately never wanting a child. She goes through with the abortion this time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by Meredith when April, who had until recently been a virgin, had a pregnancy scare:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Plans never work out the way you think they're going to. Especially with babies. You try and try to get pregnant, you can't. And then a baby comes when you least expect it, probably because you didn't plan it."
</div><ul><li> April herself ended up having a baby boy (with Jackson), who died at birth from brittle bone disease. Then, the day she finalized her divorce with Jackson, April found out she was pregnant again. This child, a girl, luckily survived.
</li><li> Gender-flipped with Owen, who always wanted children but several circumstances prevented this. Eventually, by the time he was in the process of adopting a boy, Owen discovered that his ex Teddy was pregnant with his child.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hex">Hex</a></em>: Cassie falls pregnant to Azazeal while under his influence. Upon discovering that she's pregnant, she decides to abort it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The baby survives and grows to adulthood, thanks to the efforts of the father.</span>
</li><li> Cuddy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> went to great lengths to get pregnant. When that doesn't work out, she tries to adopt which doesn't work out either, at least at first.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>. In Season 4, Marshall and Lily decide that the time just isn't right for the two of them to have a baby, and they actually make it stick; Lily doesn't get pregnant. What makes it notable is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>, the actress who plays Lily, <em>was</em> pregnant throughout the season, but the writers still passed on the chance to write it into the story.
<ul><li> In an unbelievable coincidence, Cobie Smulders (who plays Robin) was <em>also</em> pregnant at the same time, and her character also had no desire for kids. Which makes this a <strong>Double</strong> Aversion for the writers who actually pulled it off.
</li><li> Played straight in season six, where Lily and Marshall have decided that they want a baby and are having trouble conceiving. The trope is parodied initially, though; the first time they go to a fertility specialist, it's revealed that they've only been trying for <em>six days.</em> Subverted as of "Bad News." Marshall and Lily <em>both</em> learn that they are fertile. They've just had bad luck so far. (Lily becomes pregnant shortly afterwards.)
</li><li> Subverted in season 7 when Robin, who absolutely despises kids, gets a pregnancy scare only to find out that not only is it a false positive, she's <em>infertile</em>. She has no idea how to react to it, because she's never wanted kids, ever, but the knowledge that she <em>can't</em> have them, period, makes her realize that she might've wanted them someday, but now that choice has been taken from her and she'll never, ever be able to change her mind. It's made even worse when she's trying to convince herself that infertility is a good thing, now she'll never have to worry, she has no right to be sad because she never wanted kids in the first place, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">she's glad her and Barney's beautiful future kids that she's been imagining telling the story of how she met their father to aren't real...</a>
</li><li> Barney's stance on children wavers throughout the series, but overall he is against fatherhood. During the entire run of the series, he seduces countless women and none of them get pregnant... until the series finale, set over multiple years, where he accidentally gets a woman pregnant and is horrified. However, soon after his daughter Ellie is born, he completely falls in love with the baby upon holding her in his arms for the first time.
</li></ul></li><li> Carrie and Doug's difficulties in having a baby were used occasionally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>. One two-part episode had Carrie get pregnant, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">suffer a miscarriage</a>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> they end up adopting, only to find out that they are having one of their own as well.
</li><li> This appears to be law #1 on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>'s island. Pregnancy is a death sentence for mother and baby, but normal sperm count is magnified by five.
<ul><li> Also seen in flashbacks. Sun and Jin desperately want a baby, and can't conceive. Claire is on the pill and gets pregnant.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> uses this both ways with the same character: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pete unknowingly knocks up Peggy, who in turn is in very deep psychological denial about her pregnancy (and was on birth control), but takes years to do the same to his wife. Not only does she want a baby, but her father also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids">demands a grandchild</a> in return for helping Pete's business. They finally have a daughter, Tammy, in season four.</span>
<ul><li> Again played two ways with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joan</span>, who tries for months to get pregnant with her husband's child, worrying that past abortions have possibly made her infertile, then becomes pregnant with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Roger</span>'s on their one-night stand (and her only episode of infidelity).

If you're wondering how such a thing is possible, many women don't gain a noticeable amount of weight during pregnancy, especially if they're already overweight, and they might normally have irregular periods or experience minor bleeding during the pregnancy and mistake that for their period.

Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel were all infertile, and all three required divine intervention in order to have children.
</li><li> Not just Genesis; the respective mothers of Samuel, Samson, John the Baptist, and, according to some apocryphal stories, Mary were all infertile. In fact, Michal, the wife of King David and daughter of King Saul, was the only notably infertile woman in the Bible who didn't eventually give birth (her infertility being a divine punishment).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1samb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1samb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1samb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Possibly. It might be a coincidence that by that point in the story she was forced into renewing her marriage with David, who didn't love her, took pleasure in embarrassing her, and only used her as a means to an end, to secure the kingship of Israel. Several Biblical scholars have suggested that the only reason Michal had no children was that David wasn't giving her any. What makes this all the more tragic is that years earlier, Michal had saved David's life from her own father Saul, then waited while David abandoned her. Saul married her to another man who, by all accounts, loved her and treated her well; but when Saul died and David took the throne, he took her away from her husband and remarried her solely to secure the kingship. You could see why she was bitter enough to insult David for dancing in front of the ark.</span>

And of course, because apparently every member of the Simpson family <em>sans</em> Maggie was slipping Manjula fertility drugs, they have octuplets.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011">ThunderCats (2011)</a></em> episode "Native Son," a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashback</a> reveals that the king and queen of Thundera tried to have a child for years. It got so bad that the queen worried she might be infertile. Their concerns were put to rest when baby Tygra literally flew into their lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes">in a balloon</a>. So of course, just when the royal couple has gotten comfortable with Tygra inheriting the throne as crown prince, the queen became pregnant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then she died in childbirth, so little Tygra lost his mother and the throne in one night.</span>
