</p><p>Whenever the Bad Guys test another person's willingness to do immoral deeds by ordering them to do one — either to demonstrate they aren't a Good Guy in disguise or just to prove that they won't shy away from dirty work — this trope is in play. While the trope name suggests cartoonish supervillainy, more serious versions are right at home in dramatic works: if you're really with us, take these drugs; strangle this prostitute; shoot this cop.

However, it's not unheard of for those who want to rise up into the leadership of some organized crime groups, as a means to weed out possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInfiltration">undercover cops</a>, who have some latitude to do some illegal acts to maintain their cover but are never allowed to commit murder or other serious offenses.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>, bounty hunter Rally Vincent is asked to shoot a hostage with a gun with one bullet to prove she's in with the bad guys. She uses that one bullet to sever the ropes holding the hostage and shoot one of the hostage-takers in the leg. Originally, the gun wasn't loaded at all, and she's such a gun expert that she knew it from the weight and called the bad guys out on it, that's when they gave her one bullet. It helped that she was not on particularly good terms with the hostage.

<ul><li> An early story had Nami stabbing Usopp and pushing him into the water in order to prove her loyalty to Arlong. Of course, she was only pretending to do it, and stabbed her own hand to help with the ruse.
</li><li> Even before that, Zoro did a non-verbal one on her to see if Nami is truly as cold-blooded as Arlong claims by throwing himself into the pool while tied up. Nami leaps after him without hesitation.
</li><li> She was also told to shoot Luffy even earlier to prove her loyalty to Buggy. Short story shorter, she failed the test that time - lucky for the next 500 chapters or so.
</li><li> Hordy Jones' men force the people of Fishman Island to step on a picture of their beloved, assassinated Queen Otohime to prove their acceptance of Jones over the old monarchy. Somewhat subverted, in that Hordy Jones plans to kill those who had signed Otohime's petition even if they did go through the Fumi-e.

When the World Choujin Federation suspect 'Chanelman' of being Kin, they put out a picture of Mayumi, as part of a Fumi-e. Kinnikuman gladly stomps on the photo, to which Meat silently remarks that this sort of test is easy for Kinnikuman, who has the least respect for his father.
</li><li> Later, it's revealed that the WCF has something similar as their normal entrance test - to join them, you must bring in the severed head of a heroic Choujin. Two of the applicants try to fake it and are kicked out, while one passes by bringing the head of a rival company's former champion.

<ul><li> Season 3: To further validate his deep-cover identity in a drug cartel, Jack gets a gang tattoo and a heroin addiction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The heroin was really a bonus for Jack, who had already earned the cartel's trust by that point.</span>
</li><li> Season 3 (again): The Salazars order Jack to kill his partner, Chase (who has no idea what's going on). Jack pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty.
</li><li> <em>Another</em> Season 3 example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nina</span> decides to see if Jack has gone rogue or if he's still a government agent (and plotting her death), ... by making out with him? This is the test he actually fails, he returns the kiss, but she can tell he's faking it.

</li><li> In short: Jack Bauer's <em>real</em> superpower is that half the time, he'll eat that kitten.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em>, a woman working with an undercover agent ends up murdered because 1) she refuses to take her dealer's heroin (she was pregnant) and 2) her handler refused to step in when she gave him the code phrase for "I want out".

<ul><li> One of these tests is given (off screen) to a Federal mole in the Salvadorian mafia. We are later shown the carved up remains of the guy he was ordered to kill, showing that he "passed."
</li><li> On another episode, Tina and Julian go undercover as an aspiring porn star and her boyfriend. When the director/drug dealer they were meeting with demands a blow job right there in his office, Tina manages to stall him until he implicates himself.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCleaner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCleaner">The Cleaner</a></em> had Arnie infiltrating a biker gang. Unfortunately for him, they force him to smoke meth, his drug of choice before he got clean, to prove he's not a cop. Things... don't end well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wiseguy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wiseguy">Wiseguy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season one, deep cover agent Vincent Terranova is instructed to murder a federal agent to gain mobster Sonny Steelgrave's trust. He compliantly goes to the agent's house and shoots him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ... or rather, shoots the bulletproof vest Vinny covertly warned his fellow fed to don</span>.
</li><li> Vinnie has another test later in the first season when he's infiltrating a different organization. Mel Profitt gets annoyed with one of the guests on his yacht and orders Vinnie to throw her overboard. Vinnie refuses. But it works out because Mel respects Vinnie for standing up to him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>. Undercover cop Desmond Mobay uses various tricks to appear to be a user, such as palming or only partially snorting the drug. Unfortunately the inmates are wise to these tricks and force him to snort several lines of cocaine while they surround him. They insist on witnessing one of his drug deals; Mobray gets round this by selling to another undercover cop, so no law is being broken. Later they tell Mobay that to join their gang he must kill someone. Mobay, who now has a serious drug habit, murders a corrupt cop who's threatened to expose him. He eventually confesses to the crime when it sinks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">how far he's strayed</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>
<ul><li> Stabler faces this when he goes undercover as a suburban drug dealer. The drug syndicate he's "contracting" with to be his new suppliers tries to get him to sample some of his own product. Stabler hotly refuses, saying that his day job runs random drug tests. It works.
</li><li> In another episode, Stabler, having gone undercover to gain the trust of a serial rapist, has to rape a woman that the real rapist kidnapped. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately, he's able to worm his way out of it by telling the rapist that he doesn't like doing it in front of another guy, so the rapist obliges and leaves the room. Stabler then tells the victim that he's a cop, and she needs to scream convincingly. It works.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In a first season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, Sinclair is put in this situation, having infiltrated a fanatical pro-Earth group, and is asked to prove his sincerity by killing an alien (and one he met previously at that). DefiedSinclair and Ivanova start a firefight instead; Garibaldi and security soon locate them and secure the scene.
</li><li> Done in Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfCloth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfCloth">A Touch of Cloth</a></em>, after Macratty begins to suspect Jack is an undercover cop. He gives him a gun and orders him to shoot Twitch. Jack duly pulls the trigger (it helps that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is the man who killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">Todd Carty</a></span>), but the gun isn't loaded. Convinced Jack isn't a cop, Macratty kills Twitch himself for good measure.
</li><li> Also in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, where the former Maquis crew members were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">forced to begin rebelling again by hypnotic suggestion</a>, with the only one unaffected being Tuvok. He's handed a phaser and told to kill Captain Janeway. Tuvok presses the trigger and nothing happens. When Janeway asks him about this later, he answers, "They would not have given a person they were suspicious of an active weapon." Janeway finds this bit of logic to be... less than ironclad.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice">Miami Vice</a></em>, Detective Gina Calabrese is attempting to infiltrate a crime lord's organization by going undercover as a prostitute. The crime lord insists she has sex with him. To protect her cover, Gina agrees.

They don't believe him so to "prove it" he has to mug somebody on the street. Jerry's parents walk by and George tries to get them to pretend he's robbing them but they dismiss him.
<div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later. <br/><strong>Morty Seinfeld:</strong> How're your folks? <br/><strong>George:</strong> Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch — you don't want to know. <em>[remembering watching the Van Buren Boys]</em> Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street! <br/><strong>Morty:</strong> What did you say? <br/><strong>George:</strong> Come on, hurry up, old man!

</div></li><li> Subverted amusingly in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>. Veronica actually tries to do this when she thinks she has found an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">Animal Wrongs Group</a> by advocating outright terroristic tactics, but it doesn't work out because the activists are the sensible, law-abiding sort who don't believe in extreme methods.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used preemptively in an episode. Sam, in his cover as a crooked cop, pulls the bad guy of the week over, hops into his passenger seat, and snorts a pinch of white powder before introducing himself. One of the show's signature voice-overs informs the audience that snorting a crushed-up lactase tablet isn't comfortable, but goes a long way toward establishing criminal credibility.
</li><li> Not just Sam, but the <em>whole crew</em> use this trope frequently to maintain their cover identities with the bad guys. During the course of the show, they've yelled at, threatened, punched, and even shot at <em>each other</em> to prove whatever various identity they were under at the moment. Michael even mentions over voice-over how much skill/training it requires to shoot and deliberately miss but make it look like you're trying to hit.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet">undercover-as-a-hooker</a> Diana has to pick up a client to prove her worth and Neal steps in to play the part of her john:
<div class="indent"><strong>Neal:</strong> What were you going to do if I hadn't come in? <br/><strong>Diana:</strong> Well, I'd have put this strawberry in that guy's mouth, taken him up to my room, put a gun between his ribs and told him to shut up and sit tight, or I'd arrest him for solicitation.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "The Internet Is Forever" (5x22), in order to get accepted to the UnSub's online club, which provides access to live footage of him killing people, prospective members have to download child porn onto their computers. There's a subtle difference in this example in that the child porn is not specifically a morality test. The new members are not required to like or to watch child porn. The reasoning is that the mere presence of child porn saved on your computer is a serious felony, so the leaders will have a threat to hold over everyone's head.
</li><li> The child porn version is mentioned in another episode, "P911", where the head of the Crimes Against Children unit explains that pedophile rings routinely trade content for that very reason (weeding out undercover cops). It isn't used as a test within the episode, just an explanation for why finding the source of a particular video is difficult (since it's been passed multiple times).
</li><li> Mentioned again in "Supply and Demand", wherein they work with another team tracking a human trafficking setup. The BAU asks how they can have undercover agents on the case, since they'd obviously have to commit a crime to be accepted into the club, and the team leader explains that they set their undercover agents up as potential targets instead. Though they're later able to track the criminals with the logic that white collar crime like real estate fraud would be enough to qualify them, and it seems like that would be easy enough for them to set up a fake.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Caprica">Caprica</a></em>: Daniel Graystone's order to the U-87 to shoot his dog. He wasn't testing for evil so much as total <em>amorality</em> (or, more accurately, he hoped to see otherwise, indicating Zoe was inside). Zoe later says that she knew the gun was unloaded. If it hadn't been, she might have instead shot Daniel Graystone himself (her father).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>, Jack insists that anyone he mentors be truly ambitious, not just trying to get closer to him out of love and admiration. Thus, "if you're so ambitious, cut off my pinkie." Jonathan refuses, horrified, because then Jack wouldn't be perfect anymore.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MacGyver1985">MacGyver</a></em> tries to join a pack of terrorists as a mole, he is given a gun and asked to kill another terrorist to prove his loyalty. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>, he doesn't, saying that he despises leaders who are so eager to lose their men. It works.
</li><li> A variant occurs in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget">Human Target</a></em>: the head villain of the episode doesn't <em>know</em> Chance snatched the actual hitman and is now pretending to be him. Still, this otherwise plays out fairly straight: Chance, undercover, is given the order to kill a prisoner... which he <strong>does</strong>. Then, when the boss leaves the room, he improvises a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator">defibrillator</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">recuscitates</a> the guy.
</li><li> This happens a couple of times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>.
<ul><li> While posing as a mafia hitman, Chuck has to torture Casey. Casey takes this rather well, commenting that Chuck did him a favor by ripping out a tooth that had a cavity and saving him a trip to the dentist.
</li><li> While posing as an arms dealer, Morgan invokes this on himself by pulling out his cell phone and orders someone to murder a puppy.
<div class="indent"><strong>Morgan:</strong> I told you, <em>murder the puppy!</em> [hangs up] It's so hard to find good henchmen these days.

He'd always find a way to finesse the issue until he could bring the actual criminals to justice.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, the episode "Wrestling With Demons" is about a demonic academy whose graduation ritual is killing an innocent. Though in this case, the act serves the purpose of stripping them of their humanity. It's not a test to see whether they're evil, it's the act that's going to <em>make</em> them evil.
<ul><li> Borderline example: In another episode, Piper and Leo are infiltrating a group of demons who are after the innocent of the week. The pair of demons guarding the hideout asks for a password, and Piper- having no idea what it could be- blows one of them up. The other responds that that actually was the password and lets them in. It works on the same principle of ensuring anyone who enters is evil enough to kill, even if it wasn't an initiation test per say.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScarecrowAndMrsKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScarecrowAndMrsKing">Scarecrow and Mrs. King</a></em>: In one episode Lee infiltrates a group recruiting burned-out agents to do their dirty work, who lure Amanda to their base and tell him to shoot her to prove he's genuine. He seemingly goes through with it; however it turns out that he'd purposefully missed and she'd had the foresight to fling herself into the ditch and play dead (allowing her to wait until they'd left and fetch help). The scene is used to highlight the trust and unspoken communication that has developed between the pair by this point in the series.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, Benjamin Linus has to participate in the Purge perpetrated by the group later known as the Others, so as to become one of them for good (or, should we say, <em>for evil</em>) ; which means helping to murder the entirety of the DHARMA Initiative people with gas poison, including his own father (whom Ben kills himself inside a van in a remote area  he later brags about killing all the people in the pit but he didn't do it all alone, and he didn't even give the order, which probably came from the leader, advised by Richard Alpert).
</li><li> In the fourth finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>, Jane is asked to bring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lisbon's dead body</span> to Red John as proof of his change of heart and willingness to join him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode <em>literally</em> invokes this trope when Colbert asks Kentucky representative John Yarmuth his opinion \\on the topic of putting kittens in woodchippers...and Yarmuth plays straight-man in advocating the use of woodchippers in reducing the kitten overpopulation problem.
</li><li> Made even more hilarious by the fact that at the time, John Yarmuth <em>himself</em> was showing commercials (parodying some very negative advertising by the Other Team) that had such statements as "John Yarmuth goes golfing with Saddam Hussein! John Yarmuth <em>kicks puppies!</em> This is what happens when you get the main editor-slash-humour-columnist for the major "alternative" newspaper in Louisville running for public office.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a></em> episode "The Committee", Starsky is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> trying to infiltrate a group of murderous vigilante cops. As his initiation ritual they tell him to kill a slimy defense lawyer; Starsky just grabs the guy and runs. (He gets away with it mainly because his partner picks that moment to show up with backup.)

Krista replies that she never tortured anyone, and Marcus simply says that she must have <em>seen</em> torture or the results of it. Shen secretly nods her to go ahead, and Krista mouths "I'm sorry" before she starts <em>pulling out his fingernails</em>. When even that is not enough to make Shen talk, she pretends to break his finger, except she breaks her own finger, knowing it'll heal, and Shen makes a pained sound.

In order to gain full access to the Sith school on Korriban (and therefore the Star Map in a tomb there), you have to demonstrate yourself to be a hard-ass bastard in the true Sith style by destroying assassin droids, executing runaway students, and betraying pretty much every other student. The subversion is that while you <em>can</em> behave like a murderous bastard by betraying and murdering your rivals, you can also do what any good undercover Jedi would do: cheat like crazy. You can fake the deaths of the renegade students, calm the assassin droid with a conscience down, and even redeem the ghost of a Sith Lord from centuries ago and still get in.
