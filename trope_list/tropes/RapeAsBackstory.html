The overwhelming majority of characters given this treatment are female, but there are still cases of male characters, although even that is predominantly when they're young and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAbusersAreMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAbusersAreMale">done by other men</a>. While it's perfectly possible to use this trope well, when done poorly the rape is only referenced when the victim wants sympathy - mostly from their sexy new true love. In other factors of their lives, it has little impact. However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the trauma of rape can haunt somebody for the rest of their lives and flashbacks - which can be brought on for as small a reason as being alone in a room with someone - can make trusting future partners incredibly difficult. It's professional therapy, not sex with your true love, that brings relief.

</li><li> The manga <em>Asa mo, hiru mo, yoru mo</em> does this with the heroine's backstory, with the main plot being that a guy she has to work with for school looks like her rapist. Incredibly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">IT'S PLAYED FOR LAUGHS</a></em>.

One of Golzine's guards, Marvin (who is confirmed to be a pedophile), also had his way with Ash when he was about 10-years-old... and <em>filmed</em> it. Some of the other men are also stated to have photos of Ash that they use as wank material, although once Ash gets his hands on them they're promptly burned.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em>'s main plot revolves around this, as Hinako was raped repeatedly by her stepfather.

In addition, he had to pose as the Earl's son too, which adds an uncomfortable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Parental Incest</a> aspect to the whole thing even though they were not related.
</li><li> The manga shows (and the anime implies) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ciel Phantomhive suffered gang-rape at the hands of the cult who held him captive for a month.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> OVA shows that Revy was raped by a policeman as a teenager (among other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">really crappy stuff that her early years entailed</a>), leading to some serious issues in her current life as a nihilistic gunslinger and muscle for the Lagoon Company.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Osamu</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressedMemories">Repressed Memories</a> of being raped when he was younger by an older male friend.

She fell for her teacher who lured her and then had his friends gang-rape her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She ended up pregnant as a result</span>. In the anime this is watered down into a consensual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">Teacher/Student Romance</a>, though her teacher was just using her, however, her age (she's thirteen <em>tops</em>) makes it still count.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns">A Cruel God Reigns</a></em>: The series immediately launches into a 6 volume flashback telling the audience about the 6 months of sexual and physical abuse the main character, Jeremy, suffered at the hands of his stepfather.
</li><li> Genkaku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> was revealed to have been beaten and raped by a group of bullies who hung around the temple. It was definitely a contributing factor for making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade">Death Parade</a></em>, in that it was not his own rape but his <em>sister</em>'s rape. Shimada has a backstory where his younger sister came home beaten and raped. This caused him to invoke revenge on the man, and this ultimately resulted in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith">own death</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em> has the reveal of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Muraki having impulsively raped thirteen-year-old Hisoka, then cursed him so that he slowly and painfully died over the course of three years</span> as major character development for both of them. Made particularly painful by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hisoka being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empath</a> who can feel other people's emotions especially strongly through physical contact, to the extent that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Tsuzuki</a> grabbing him when he's upset causes Hisoka to scream</span>, making it a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> too.
<ul><li> Extra points for <em>1)</em> the heavy implication later on that Muraki's mother molested him and <em>2)</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">possibly-accidental</a> revelation that twelve-year-old Muraki Kazutaka looked frighteningly identical to little Hisoka. So...yeah, he was working out his <em>own</em> backstory issues there, too.
</li><li> After the Queen Camelia arc, in which Hisoka was both competent and effective, (though the trauma of having to kill the girl he liked seems to have messed him up some more, based on how he freezes the next time he has to face his nemesis), he meditates on his fear of becoming Muraki if he isn't careful, of 'losing to the Muraki in him.' There seems to be some tenuous connection to the rape here, at least in many readers' minds. The fact that Muraki started as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> to Tsuzuki, but flexibly fills this role for Hisoka in a different way and even Tatsumi in another over the course of the story, never loses and frequently wins, makes him a very depressing villain.

The emperor looks at him, and says, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">"He's pretty. Like a girl."</a>.

Given her treatment at the beginning of the OVA, as well as his inclination against ever taking "no" for an answer, one can assume that he raped her more than that throughout her life.

The farthest the guy got was a hand on his ankle before he shot him (his first time killing anything).

</li><li> It's also possible that this is the case for the women used as cattle for mother's milk, as Joe has been a slaver-polygamist for a long time. Basically, if you're a relatively healthy (as in, not terminally ill or horribly mutated) woman living on the Fury Road, there's a solid chance you've been raped by Immortan Joe at some point.

Mildmay's fate as a member of a gang of child thieves looks better at first glance, but rather than being a mother figure, the adult female gang leader took him into her bed at least from puberty on. While neither dwells all that much on the rape aspects of their childhoods (there was enough other abuse and violence, and in Felix's case, much more recent rape by the teacher who "saved" him from the brothel), both are seriously messed up psychologically as a result. And unlike in most stories, this background has warped their personalities in ways that make them often unlikable to the audience <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note68f9p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note68f9p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note68f9p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Especially Felix, who is downright vicious whenever he's not outright insane, and who starts the plot feeling sort of driven to go abuse a teenage prostitute himself in a moment of stress and only stops himself at the very last minute. Mildmay is more likable, but suffers from extremely low self-esteem and often behaves like a total doormat, just taking Felix' frequent verbal abuse.</span> and their issues are never really "fixed" throughout the 4 books, as they alternately try to change and fail or just completely give up on becoming more healthy in their personal relationships.
</li><li> Seregil, one of the main characters in Lynn Flewelling's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Nightrunner</a></em> series is a somewhat unusual example because neither does the character seem to be traumatized by what happened to him, nor does the narrative clearly condemn what would be considered child molestation in a modern setting. Over the course of the first 3 books, we are given the information that Seregil was "seduced" by a considerably older guy, but who was also "not man-grown" yet. Seregil considers this his first love and doesn't seem to have bad feelings about the sexual aspects of this "relationship", only that it turned out the guy was just trying to manipulate him into betraying his clan, which eventually led to Seregil killing a man in self-defense. Seregil hates the seducer and plans to kill him on sight if he ever meets him again, but that's for the betrayal and for his clan's honor - he's still physically attracted to him (or at least his memory of him) and he says "it didn't take much" to seduce him. But the thing is: Seregil was his species' equivalent of 12-14 years old<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7xzgv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7xzgv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7xzgv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> He was 22 in objective years. At one point, a character grown up in a human rural setting judges a 22-year-old girl of Seregil's species to be about 14 in human terms. And given that in a medieval setting, a rural 14-year-old girl would most likely not even have started menstruating or developing many secondary sexual characteristics yet (the average onset of puberty, at least for girls, for most of human history was about 16, due to stunting from malnutrition and childhood diseases), that estimate of "22 equals 14 in human years" probably should be read as "22 equals 12 in <em>modern</em> human years" - though it's not certain the author was aware of the much higher age of menarche in a pre-industrial society.</span> at the time; Seregil himself calls himself a "still a child" back then regarding the unfairness of holding him criminally liable for the manslaughter; and book 4 clarifies that the guy who seduced him was "several decades older" than him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8p70f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8p70f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8p70f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> So at least 52, which is almost Seregil's current age in the books, and he looks like he's in his early 20s, even though his birth culture still wouldn't consider him old enough to marry at 58.</span> and therefore not just an older "teenager"; and then the seducer himself mentions that Seregil's family could have had him executed for the "seduction" alone, never mind the instigation to theft and violence. (Plus, at least at this later point in their story, the seducer is perfectly willing to molest Seregil while he's drugged and sleeping, and he sadistically beats him later on, which reads like the character is and likely always was a sociopath.) It's hard to say if the author really just didn't think the age difference was a problem and/or that Seregil was old enough to have a sexual relationship, if only it had been without ulterior motives - or if she meant for the reader to think that Seregil is still in deep denial about having been molested as a child. (Which would not be all that unrealistic in terms of characterization for a child abuse victim who was carefully groomed and not physically hurt.) On the one hand, for all his romanticizing of the memories, he does treat his own young lover (17 when they get together) very carefully and tries to keep him at arm's length for a long time precisely because he thinks as an older mentor he has way too much influence over the boy to ever start a romantic relationship with him in good conscience. But on the other hand, he also still has romantic dreams/memories about his seducer that are presented to the reader without comment, and he is still conflictedly attracted to the guy and overlooks the sexual assault he inflicts on him as an adult like it didn't happen. And the very few other characters who know about this backstory don't comment critically on the age difference, given that this is a setting where it's not unusual for humans to marry at only 15, and where a 16-year-old boy is perfectly acceptable as a customer in brothels.

Differs from other examples in that she lives in a society where male on female rape does not usually happen - her sisters don't refer to it as rape, but use the normal euphemism for sex while talking about it, and emphasize the physical violence (the rapist also beat her up) far more.

<ul><li> The backstory of Sophie-Anne Leclerc, the Vampire Queen of New Orleans, is that after a plague killed his entire town except for her and her older brother, the brother (who hated her for some reason) raped her and then sold her to strangers for food and money. The brother is then killed by a vampire, but the vampire still keeps her into forced prostitution until she's turn in a failed attempt to save the vampire's life from vampire hunters.

Unfortunately, she reacted to the near-rape in stereotypical female fashion, giving Young time to report his injuries as sustained "falling down the stairs". The academy instructors didn't believe it, but Honor refused to press charges.
</li><li> DS Diane Fry in Stephen Booth's Cooper/Fry detective series. Fry was gang-raped shortly before the first novel in the series. Eventually, she discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one of the rapists was her foster brother, and her foster parents helped cover up the crime.</span>
</li><li> Angel, the heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove">Redeeming Love</a></em> by Francine Rivers, was raped at the age of eight and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">forced into prostitution</a> by her rapist.

</li><li> Zilpha Keatley Snyder came as close as she could in 1970 to giving Ivy Carson this backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChangeling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChangeling">The Changeling</a></em>. This was written just prior to the time publishers began to allow children's fiction that dealt openly and frankly with sexual abuse.
</li><li> If it doesn't happen in the novel proper, it is often revealed that the heroine (or one of her friends or relatives) of the average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel">Danielle Steel</a> novel had this happen to her.
</li><li> Zarate Arkham, the main protagonist in Daniel Gonzalez's horror novel <em>Un grito en las tinieblas</em> (A Scream in the Dark), was raped by her father as a child. Gonzalez also uses this resource with his character Laura Talbot on the <em>Ravencraft</em> series, when at the beginning of the first novel she is raped by a werewolf -and turn into one as well-.

Her justification for joining the Black Company and then sticking with it when their fortunes fell after the events of <em>She Is the Darkness</em> is that the Company is her family now, and it's either stay with them or go back to the blood relatives who abused her.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedTent">The Red Tent</a></em>, it's mentioned that Laban groped Leah and Zilpah when they were young, but before things could escalate further (and before he could hurt Rachel and Bilhah), Leah told her mother Adah, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">gave Laban ''quite'' a beating.</a> He "made amends" by offering sacrifices, buying gold bangles for all the girls, and setting up a brand-new statue of The Goddess. For her part, Leah doesn't let it bother her or sully her views on men in general, but Zilpah <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">Does Not Like Men</a> at all, and this <em>could</em> be a major reason why. Also, the gold bangles that are among the trinkets used to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> buy Ruti back from slave-traders Laban has gambled her away to</span> are implied to be Zilpah's from the aftermath of that incident, that she buried rather than chose to wear.
<ul><li> Later, Laban's second wife Ruti (who is roughly the same age as his daughters) drinks an abortifacient herbal concoction, so that Laban won't have any more sons she feels he doesn't deserve the honor of or any daughters that he'd molest. When Ruti asks Rachel to help her abort, she threatens to kill the child anyway after it's born. The other women of the camp all support Ruti's choice, on the grounds that <em>they</em> don't care much for Laban or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">the way he treats her</a>, either.

Nick was a child prostitute, and his lover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wife, later on</span> Jessica was held by a supernatural creature for two years. Long enough for her to develop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> which comes back to haunt her when the rapist decides in the second book that Jessica is to become his queen. Though the titular Dog and Spider have become inseparable lovers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> does not heal these wounds. It does, however, prompt her to seek therapy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfTheRaksura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfTheRaksura">Books of the Raksura</a></em>, the main character, Moon, a Raksura, never saw another member of his species and didn't even know how they were called or if he was the only one left. Moon was desperately trying to find any signs, anything about his race, until he found a city attacked by the Fell, a race of vicious flying predators who eat intelligent beings. There, a Fell ruler (always male gender) called Liheas tried to brainwash him into thinking he was Fell too and then raped him, after which Moon realized he was not one of them and broke the ruler's neck while the ruler was sleeping, then set the room on fire and escaped. Because of this traumatic event, he stopped all attempts to ever try to find his race, didn't care anymore about himself for a long time, and became cynical, wary and distrustful of others, especially of the Fell and even more of the Raksura.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAscendantKingdomsSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAscendantKingdomsSaga">Ice Forged</a></em>, because the guards at the Velant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony">Penal Colony</a> are usually people who were a hair away from being prisoners there themselves, it's common for female inmates to get raped repeatedly by the guards. What sets Kestel Falke apart is that the first two guards to force themselves on her both turned up dead later, due to her prowess as an assassin. There wasn't a third attempt. Notably this <em>isn't</em> used as a reason for Kestel's personality: in the time we know her she simply takes it in stride as something that happened to her a long time ago.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautifulLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautifulLosers">Beautiful Losers</a></em>: Edith was gang-raped as a 13-year-old, as described in a flashback. How this affected her is never really explored, but it may have had something to do with her hypersexuality and eventual suicide.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmareAlley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightmareAlley">Nightmare Alley</a></em> during a conversation with Stan, Lilith rather off-handedly reveals to him that she was gang-raped when she was 16 years old. This could perhaps provide some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">explanation</a> for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeLeadsToInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeLeadsToInsanity">cold and sociopathic behavior</a>, but at the same time could also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">a fabrication</a> and yet another way by which she is manipulating his emotions to control him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>, this is part of the backstory for both Sergeant Bothari (who had been forced to work as a child prostitute; he reflects that as far as he can see, the only reason his mother went through with giving birth to him instead of aborting him was that she could make more money hiring him out to paedophile customers than hiring herself out to normal customers) and to Mark Vorkosigan (who, as a teenager, had been tortured and raped by his abusive guardian with a shock probe as a punishment for daring to go out on a date with a woman). Not surprisingly, this affects their sexual development: in Bothari's case, he is sexually aroused by violence (making it easy for Ges Vorrutyer, one of the villains of the first book, to manipulate him into raping prisoners), while Mark, in the first two books in which we meet him, is incapable of having sex at all unless injected with massive doses of aphrodisiac (in <em>Mirror Dance</em>, he comes close to raping a young girl, and is prevented from this not by moral scruples but by physical incapacity). Mark, with the help of psychiatric treatment, eventually recovers to the point where he's able to have a loving, consensual relationship. Bothari never fully overcomes his psychological problems or finds a partner, but, when he is lucid enough to think at all rationally, he can see that rape is wrong and prefers to have sex with (presumably consenting) adult prostitutes, particularly if they 'don't make a noise' - probably because noise could remind him of the sound of victims screaming in pain or fear. And he does manage to be a responsible if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad">Over Protective Dad</a> to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>.

<ul><li> Det. Olivia Benson believes that she is the product of her mother's rape, and it forms the core of her character, although in later episodes it is debated whether or not her mother had fabricated this story to cover the shame of a drunken sex act; her mother was an alcoholic. It is confirmed even later that Benson's mother was telling the truth. It was just harder for Olivia to acknowledge when her father became more than just the faceless monster she always pictured.
</li><li> Also Rollins was raped by her superior before she came to the Special Victims Unit, which becomes an issue in one episode when she has to deal with a case where he committed a similar crime against another woman. Eventually, she gets him convicted of the later crime, which seems to help her.
</li><li> It's revealed in later seasons that Brian Cassidy was also molested as a child, which is hinted to be the real reason why he left the SVU (initially, it was portrayed as him being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Naïve Newcomer</a> who couldn't handle the realities of sex crimes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vuy1');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vuy1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vuy1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">obviously, the Meta reason was a contractual problem with the actor</span>), because it was dredging up too many memories.

The word "rape" is never used and so the scene is open to interpretation, but a good number of the fans (and Jennie Garth herself) regard the story as a case of date rape.

Instead it was attempted rape, and what happened instead mentally scarred her for life. Yes, this is a webcomic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a></em> has <em>two</em> characters with a back story like this. It's debatable whether the love interest of the protagonist would count, since she consented beforehand, but was heavily pressured into it and was verbally abused immediately after. The character Melna, however, was raped by Stonewater in one of the most mind-boggling arcs in the entire series, in what was essentially a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie">Mate or Die</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy">Rape by Proxy</a> that effectively victimized <em>both</em> of them.
