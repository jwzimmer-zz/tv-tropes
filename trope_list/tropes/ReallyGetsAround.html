</p><p>A character who is well known for how <em>easy</em> they are. For sexual contact, that is. This trope is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> writ large: when a male character sluts it up, he's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan">Kavorka Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>, or maybe an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPornomancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPornomancer">Accidental Pornomancer</a> if they are innocent and aren't actively seeking it out. When a woman does it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">time for the most insulting and aggressive adjectives</a>, with "Really Gets Around" as a euphemism.
</p><p>This sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">overlaps with being evil</a>, but is also a staple of sitcoms where it's more used as a simple source of humor. Jokes will usually play on her astonishing number and variety of partners. Often described as man-hungry, easy, loose or fast. In a more rural setting, she is often branded the "village bicycle" (been everywhere and everyone's had a ride...). Expect generous quotations from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicSutra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicSutra">Comic Sutra</a>.

</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">Anything That Moves</a> is a subtrope, and one of the few cases where a male character will typically be portrayed badly for it. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">Ethical Slut</a> is a specific, more modern subtrope which isn't portrayed negatively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual">Extreme Omnisexual</a> is related, for characters that are <em>more</em> than bisexuals. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHasLotsOfSex">Everybody Has Lots of Sex</a> for cases where this Trope more-or-less applies to the entire cast of a work.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this is always a subjective topic with lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> issues. In the words of couples therapist Esther Perel, "Even under the cloak of anonymity, gender stereotypes persist. Men are socialized to boast, exaggerate, and overrepresent their sexual exploits, while women minimize, deny, and underrepresent theirs." What is true for men also goes for politicians, Hollywood actors, rock stars, sport stars and other media celebrities. Power and wealth eroticize, so they will attract more groupies and lusting fans. On the other hand their reputations are often exaggerated in the popular press or by themselves. The celebrities will be depicted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">Bigger Is Better in Bed</a> or sexual supermen/women while most of them are in reality not that well endowed or that exceptionally great in bed. Similarly most of them are too preoccupied with their jobs, family, traveling and other stuff to be constantly making out. Many rock stars are too exhausted after a concert to immediately get it on with their groupies, for instance.

If you believe some people, they have sex every day of the week and not only that: it's always a satisfying experience. As the old saying goes: <em>Money and sex are the topics people lie about the most.</em> The only real people who, without a doubt, undeniably really get around are prostitutes and porn actors.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism">France</a> epitomizes this trope, with his character being mainly defined by his constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">flirting with</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">undressing of</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">feeling up</a> the other nations. Just <em>how</em> successful he is at actually getting farther than stripping them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">up to debate</a> though, seeing that most of the other nations show far more interest in keeping their distance from him than anything else.
</li><li> Greece might somewhat fit this trope, being said to be the most sexually active country around (surpassing even <em>France</em>), but his promiscuity isn't his main defining character trait unlike with France, so he comes across as more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavySleeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavySleeper">sleepy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">laidback</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">somewhat spacey</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover">cat lover</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">just happens to be really good at getting laid</a>. Add to that the fact that canon has shown him expressing sexual/romantic interest in only Japan so far, and it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that fanworks don't really emphasize this trait of his as much as for France who is <em>way</em> more blatant and showy about it.
</li><li> In fact, pretty much <em>any</em> and <em>every</em> nation can fall into this trope in fanworks that equate all forms of international relations with the sexual kind.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei">B Gata H Kei</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yamada wants to become this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForSex">intending to get 100 sex friends</a> in high school. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> mixed signals she sends out and her own sexual insecurity have so far prevented this, as will probably the genuine feelings for Kosuda she developed.
</li><li> Chika seems to be this. It is extremely heavily implied (especially in the manga) that she has sex with those boys that give her gifts, and there are quite a lot of them. Half-averted: when asked how to "do it without screwing up" she declares she doesn't know anything about that. Whether she means she doesn't know anything about sex, or just never worried about messing up, is left to the reader.
</li></ul></li><li> During a flashback in chapter 78 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em>, it is implied that Shura constantly threw herself at men when she was younger. When Shiro tells her she should have more respect for herself, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarshmallowHell">takes her top off and shoves her breasts in his face</a>. We later find out Shiro Fujimoto was exactly the same way in his 20s.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Emperor Charles Zi Britania has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> wives. All are royalty, and obviously many have born him children. In fact, the protagonist's mother was his fifth wife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">and very cunning in her own right</a></span>, and Lelouch was the 17th born (and 11th boy) in the family. Think about that. 108 wives, who bore an indeterminate (with eighteen as the lowest possible guess) number of kids, all competing for the throne, many with genius level intelligence, many chessmasters, several downright ruthless, in a family that rules the society based on survival of the fittest. Yikes, Charles, couldn't you keep it in your pants? It comes into perspective when you realize Nunnally is 87th in line for the throne. In other words, she must be Charles' 87th child. Now, keep in mind the age difference between Lelouch and Nunnally is only 3 years. This means that between their births, he produced <em>70 other children</em>.
<ul><li> In some defense to Charles, some later material suggests she got bumped down there as a result of being out of the family for a while, as a similarly 'disinherited and later reinherited' family member Marrybell is the 88th princess and is notably older than Nunnally.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Cross Marian</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> He appears to be a big Ladies Man. Allen notes that Cross is supported by numerous lovers in different places. We meet one of his lovers, Anita, the owner of a large brothel in China. And it's from Anita that we hear Cross had relations with her mother as well, who was also in love with him. It's possible Maria was a lover of his, given their coziness with one another when Cross summons her -such as her being shown hold / cupping his face, in addition to the cover Hoshino drew where Maria is draped over Cross, and he's leaning his head on her. Allen also states in a JUMP SQ extra, that under his bed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser">his church</a>, he has things from his lovers, pictures, accessories. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says he likes good women, and his interest is visiting the Red-Light District. He's referred to as a womanizer by Allen's friends.

A fact which her mother, Madoka, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">constantly berates her for</a>; especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">Sayoko continues to sleep around</a> and actively encourages Yohko to do the same.

Also notable that her many conquests include such notorious womanizers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">Hercules</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a>, the fifth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>.
<ul><li> With a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">name like that</a>, you'd think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">most guys would want to keep their distance</a>.
</li><li> The very first story of her short-lived ongoing series revealed the KGB infected her with a dormant mind controlling STD way back when. Since she's been with some of the biggest man-whores in Marvel, this turned out to be a very bad thing.
</li><li> Hawkeye also only gradually grew into his reputation as a womanizer, as during the Silver Age he really only was just involved with the Black Widow (it did not end well) and then the Scarlet Witch (unrequited).
</li></ul></li><li> It's not a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> comic unless Johnny Storm is either on his way to, in the middle of, or recovering from some supermodel date.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Matt Murdock</a>, referred to by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> as the "biggest him-bo" in the Marvel Universe. Which was pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">hilarious</a>, given how much Wolverine gets around.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> story, Loki recruits Spider-Man's help in dealing with a woman who is a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>. Later, Loki discovers that the woman is his daughter. When Spidey is surprised that Loki has children, Loki says that he has hundreds. ("I'm a Norse God," he says. "It... happens." Clearly, he's very much like his mythological counterpart in this regard.)
<ul><li> Spidey himself is no slouch in this department either. While not near the number of lovers Tony Stark, Daredevil, or Wolverine has amassed, Peter for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">supposedly</a> unattractively nerdy person has had quite a few lovers: Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane, Felicia Hardy, Debra Withman, Michelle Gonzales and Carlie Cooper are just the tip of the iceberg. What makes Peter perhaps exceptional in this regard is that he is actually serious about his relationships with his sexual partners (only confirmed to have had sex with a few of the above) and was even married for a long time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">and most people would prefer he still be married, making Peter one of a few characters on the list who people prefer to not be this trope</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's become a running joke that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> is very... liberated. But she did <em>not</em> sleep with Juggernaut! Well she did, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">wasn't her</a>, OK?
<ul><li> Her Skrull friend Jazinda is similarly uninhibited. When She-Hulk asked her how many people she'd had sex with she replied five. Then asked to confirm that she had meant at the same time, right?
</li><li> Heck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> himself has been around too and has a couple of kids to prove it (makes you wonder why he's so angry). At least Jen uses birth control.
</li><li> Jen's also gotten quite friendly with Starfox, whose real name is Eros for a reason.
</li><li> Jen was once ordered in court to list off every sexual partner that she (as She-Hulk and not Jennifer) ever had. Without pause, it took her 20 minutes to list off everyone.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mystique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mystique">Mystique</a> has a long list of ex-husbands and an even longer list of people she has slept with. Her official stats page lists two sons and two ex-husbands, neither husband being the father of either child. Her list of conquests is so long, it'd be easier to list the people in Marvel she hasn't slept with.
<ul><li> In the story fleshing out the backstory of her son Nightcrawler, she was married to the head of the house, sleeping with the driver while pretending to be the maid, and then started sleeping with her husband's best friend. It was also implied she'd slept with her fertility doctor when she had trouble having children with her husband.
</li><li> Azazel too, given that he has had dozens of children by multiple women, including Mystique. Ironically enough, their son is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Nightcrawler</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a>'s male counterpart in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">Hercules</a>.

His other known very good friends include the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a>, Snowbird, Namora, Alflyse, Psylocke, Nova, queen of the Dark Elves, and quite possibly Northstar. He also owns hundreds of properties around the world, each of them home to a former lover. Since he is an immortal that has traveled the world since Ancient Greece, various historical figures/gods/regular women have probably been left off his full list.

Nobody seems surprised by this, at least in her native Highlands where it's accepted. In the Middle Kingdoms, where the sexually-repressed Divine King religion holds sway, not so much.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis">Persepolis</a></em>, Marjane's friend, Julie, mentions that she had sex with 18 boys (and later has sex with another one).

<ul><li> Batman himself is something of a subversion: While he has definitely had a lot of sex partners (Catwoman, Talia, Vicki Vale, Julie Madsen, Jezebel Jet, Silver St. Cloud... and possibly Zatanna) for a guy who is supposed to be a bitter loner, it's nowhere near the Starkian number that people think <em>billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne</em> has had. In one comic it's mentioned that trying to make people think this is one of the more difficult parts of his masquerade.
</li><li> His protege <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> also has a reputation for this. In reality, while <em>plenty</em> of women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">are vocally attracted to him</a>, his actual dating history is a lot shorter.

He (mostly) stops after officially getting together with Jena.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> up above, he's been around since the 19th century, and by "been around" I <em>mean</em> "been around." An entire plotline in the comics centered around a villain gathering up as many of Logan's unknown illegitimate children as he could find and sending them to attack him so he would kill them all as part of a revenge plot to screw with his head. Wolvie may get more tail than <em>Stark</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> (mostly) with Queen Maeve, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBoys">The Boys</a></em>.

She has had countless boyfriends over the course of the series. It is lampshaded by herself that she has to dump them at the end of each story to make room for the next one in the next story. Only one guy, Jens, stayed with her for longer than one album, but eventually even that story arc got axed. Creator Merho said: "My readers couldn't decide whether he should have stayed with her or not, so whatever I did I would've created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a>." In a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion,</a> however, it is implied on several occasions that she actually doesn't sleep around a lot, but simply has a lot of dates.

The highest known number is 322. She also went with the protagonist Aldo because she had <em>bet she could do all guys in her high school in five years</em> (by the way, she lost: Aldo was in love with her and incredibly shy, and when she finally tried he locked himself in the toilet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">She dumped him for that</a>).

As a succubus-like witch, Dora had to really get around to get energy she needed to live. After the events of book one, she doesn't have to, but she already has a reputation, so in the next books the gossips are that she slept with <em>everybody</em> she met with, including her Guardian Angel, two archangels, Lucifer, Baal, Angel of Death, local vampire lord, local Alpha and her subordinate vampires. None of this is true  she sleeps with exactly two people during the series.

<ul><li> Later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HereticsOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HereticsOfDune">Dune</a></em> books have the Honored Matres, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">so good in bed</a> that the experience acts as an addictive narcotic. In contrast to the Bene Gesserit end of improving the human condition, this is quite openly about ruthless, selfish control, and philosophically at least, the Bene Gesserit have nothing but contempt for them (to the point where their epithet for the Honored Matres is "whore").
<ul><li> Then, Duncan Idaho learns how to do it too, and passes the secrets on to a secret organization of men, leading to a shadow war were most battles are about who can out-nookie whom.

Early on in the series she mentions that after a bad break-up she will turn to the nearest guy for a weekend of sex, but that she specifically doesn't enjoy it when it's over. Within the series itself it seems that she prefers a monogamous relationship but that doesn't mean she isn't dating a new guy every couple of episodes, as her relationship with Leonard became romantic and progressively more serious this trait has fallen away. Her bouncing around from guy to guy was more indicative of her tendency to go for pretty-boy jerks.

Interestingly, though, all three were something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> of the trope, as their motives and reasons for being so open were explored in depth—with Frasier and Lilith around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a> was strictly averted.

However, he genuinely wanted a steady relationship, and repeatedly tried with Diane and Rebecca to settle down. After being dumped in one episode, he falls off the wagon and runs around with a young woman; Coach seems genuinely upset by both, indicating that Sam did this a lot more often when he drank. Eventually, Sam even admitted that he had become a sex addict, and actively sought therapy to help cure his illness.
</li><li> Carla Tortelli has eight children by at least two different fathers, and once looked forward to an evening off with "a little R and R"—that is, two men with names beginning with the letter. Despite the occasional barb, though, she was genuinely respected (or perhaps feared) by all of the patrons of Cheers. When Carla became unwillingly pregnant by a random man, the entire bar rallied to collect money for her and even sang her a song as she marched up the stairs in triumph.
</li><li> And finally there's Rebecca Howe, who bought the bar later in the show's run. In high school, she was apparently known as "Backseat Becky" (although she tries to claim that this was because she "never took a backseat to anyone", which fails miserably).

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">negative implications</a> of this trope when applied to female characters are somewhat subverted, however, by her friends' usually tolerant reactions and her often being portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">having a clearly defined code of conduct in terms of who she dates</a>, a responsible attitude towards safe sex and genuine feelings for her (many) romantic interests.

Eddie repeatedly disparages Monty for his lifestyle and tries to warn him of the consequences, but Monty never takes it seriously.
</li><li> Despite being well into her fifties, Rose from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em> has no trouble getting men... <em>especially</em> the married kind.

Aneka, who frequently has casual sex with men, often to get items which the Resistance needs, information, or once simply for <em>the time of day</em>. What takes the cake is her part in a pagan ritual where she'd planned on doing it with <em>three hundred</em> guys on a single night (judging by the line, she had gotten through more than half). In one episode, when asked by a <em>cyclops</em> if she's ever been with one, the following exchange occurs:

She appears to hit on any mildly attractive man within sight. When Clark first arrives to the Daily Planet, one of the first things that happens to him is Cat inviting him over (then again, Dean Cain can hardly be called unattractive). Lois explains that Cat's bed is like Grand Central Station (even though they're not in New York). Not only has Cat slept with countless men, but she has also done it in any imaginable location. One episode involves Lois getting a luxury hotel room to pamper herself but ends up witnessing something across the street and brings back Clark with her for a stakeout. Cat shows up and reveals that not only has she been to this particular room before but proves it by revealing her name carved into an end table. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> forced the character to be removed after the first season.

Not all of them women, and not always one at a time. One time a case needed to interview his past flings over an eight week period and the total number of interviews came in at ninety-two. When he is dating someone though he is faithful except for when he wanted Eve to break up with him. Maze is another example, she's slept with Dan, Amenadiel, Lucifer, and a bunch of other dudes, offered to sleep with Linda and has a crush on Eve.

</li><li> And there's Hawkeye, who at least <em>flirts</em> with all the males while sleeping with (nearly) all the women. In the later seasons, this was somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a>, with it being seen as pathetic instead of Casanova-like.

</li><li> Nathan too is quite like this, and catches an STD in one case. After he meets Marnie though, this changes him and the pair go off to raise her baby together.

<ul><li> Jackie has this reputation. In one episode she and her then-boyfriend, Fred, have an incident when they discuss how many people they've slept with. She estimates about three per year, which makes about sixty overall (though it's probably more—Fred just assumes she started around eighteen, while her reaction says otherwise). Fred has been with <em>three</em> women, counting her, and is a bit freaked out. (They started dating after a one-night stand got Jackie pregnant, so he probably should have known better.)

<ul><li> Also Julie Keaton the pharmaceutical representative.
</li><li> Elliot <em>sort of</em> had such a reputation applied to her, beginning in the second season. Whether it's <em>Apropos</em> or not is debatable; it was originally the result of a one-night stand with a surgeon, who shared the details with everyone he knew.

He's only been in love 4 times (Caroline, Tatia, Camille, and Aurora). He only has one child surprisingly due to vampire sterility. Also Marcel has slept with a number of women but has been in love with Rebekah for years. Kol counts as well but once he met Davina, he was devoted to her and she to him.

She's dated most of the main men. She dated Matt and Tyler, Damon compelled her to sleep with him. She married Stefan. Was engaged to Alaric but that was for convenience. And she slept with Klaus in the woods once. Her daughter Lizzie on Series/Legacies is implied to be this as well.

It wasn't until the summer was nearly over that the world finally learned the truth: the mysterious offspring was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle">Hornswoggle</a>, the "leprechaun" companion to the Irish wrestler Finlay!</span> Triple H (who, being married to Stephanie McMahon, was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Hornswoggle">Hornswoggle</a></span>'s half-brother-in-law) thought this was hilarious, and drove Vince to distraction with his endless jokes about his having impregnated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a midget</span>. ("Was she magically delicious?") Enraged at first, Vince gradually warmed up to the idea of having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hornswoggle</span> as a son, even booking him in high-profile matches. But then, early in 2008, WWE's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">resident bully</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a>, launched an unprovoked attack on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hornswoggle</span>. When asked to account for himself, JBL explained that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hornswoggle</span> was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Finlay</span>'s son rather than Mr. McMahon's! It had all been an elaborate, eight-month-long prank perpetuated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Finlay and Hornswoggle</span>!
<ul><li> This whole storyline was a clumsy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>. Vince's limo had "exploded," with him in it, at the end of the June 11 <em>Raw,</em> which had been, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">"Vince McMahon Appreciation Night."</a> The planned "funeral" angle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">had to be abandoned</a> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> tragedy. It was supposed to end with Mr Kennedy being Vince's son, but he got suspended the week of the advertised finale.
</li><li> Try to wrap your head around how many of WWE's roster at the time needed to not know their father in order for this storyline to work.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, in real life, is said to be this.

He also mentioned the same as to why he couldn't be a candidate for Vince's son in the above.
</li><li> It's not that he's slept with a lot of women, it's just that he's had a lot of relationships with women, never actual one-night stands. Though, considering that those relationships inevitably hit third base considering him, this trope still applies. The fact that this has never played a major part of his character<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9bki9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9bki9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9bki9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Especially when CM originally stood for Chick Magnet</span> is astonishing.

<ul><li> Freyja, the goddess of love in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. In at least two poems in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em> she is called out on sleeping around. To receive a necklace, named Brísingamen, she slept with four dwarves for four nights. Loki even accuses her of sleeping with everyone in Ásgarðr, including her own brother. She's not just the goddess of love, but of fertility as well.
<ul><li> Loki himself has his own history. He impregnates a female giant thrice, which results in Fenrir, Jörmungandr and Hel. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick">gets impregnated by a male</a> horse, which results in Sleipnir. He boasts about committing adultery with Týr's wife and impregnating her. While he has a faithful wife all along. A wife so faithful that after all his promiscuity she will stand by his side until Ragnarök, holding a bowl over him to gather the venom of an adder hung over his bound body, thus sparing him the torture.
</li></ul></li><li> While we're on the subject of gods, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Zeus</a>. Just Zeus. Much to the rage of his wife Hera, and much to the misfortune of whomever he slept with (especially when you consider that not all of those trysts were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeDivineOnMortal">consensual</a>) <em>and</em> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine">demigod</a> children.
<ul><li> This was the basis for the 400-year setup of an astronomical joke. The planet Jupiter (Jupiter is the Roman name for Zeus) has four large moons, each named after Zeus' mistresses. In 2016, the NASA Juno space probe arrived at the planet Jupiter. Juno is the Roman name for Hera, thus sparking jokes that Jupiter/Zeus's wife was coming to confront him and his mistresses.
</li><li> Most of the Olympians qualify to some degree, for that matter. Hermes, for example, had thirty-five different lovers. Ironically, the goddess of love Aphrodite was relatively prudish, only having ten lovers.
</li><li> Poseidon was almost as much a seducer as his brother, having many lovers. One story tells how he wooed Demeter (his sister); she tried to reject him and turned herself into a mare to flee, but he turned himself into a stallion and caught her. (This resulted in Demeter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">giving birth to a foal</a> named named Arion, which grew into a horse that could <em>talk</em>. Poseidon held horses to be sacred as a result.) Unlike Hera, Poseidon's wife Amphitrite didn't seem to care about his philandering.
</li><li> Equally if not even more ironic, Cupid, the god of love, had one wife and was faithful to her. The other Olympian who was completely faithful (or nearly so)? Hades, god of the underworld.
<ul><li> The notable exceptions among the twelve major Olympians were virgin goddesses Hestia, Artemis and Athena, and of course Hera, goddess of marriage. Notice a pattern?
</li></ul></li><li> One of the interpretations of the Ganymede story was that he was stolen from Greece by Zeus and taken to Olympus to be Zeus's *ahem* "cup bearer". Notably, Ganymede is one of the few whom Hera didn't torture, but she still hated him.
</li><li> Some of the pre-Olympian gods also led an active sex life, earth-goddess Gaia, for instance. Gaia even mated with Tarterus itself in order to bear Typheus, her most powerful offspring. (Which meant, more or less, that Typheus was the offspring of the Earth and Hell.)
</li></ul></li><li> Hercules once slept with (depending on the version) between 12 and 50 king's daughters in one night at the daring of Hippolyta to get her belt, since she told him that she'd only give it to him if he slept with/impregnated all these different women. She thought this would take him ages, giving her time to seduce one of his friends that he'd brought with him. She was beyond flabbergasted, not to mention annoyed, when he slept with them all in one night. No wonder this is sometimes called his Thirteenth Labor, especially since every single one of them got knocked up that night.
<ul><li> There's another legend that he was staying with a king who had (again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>) 50 or 100 daughters. He realized that he couldn't find a better father for his grandchildren than Hercules, and, well, same basic story as the above.
</li><li> That is on top of the many women (and men) he slept with individually. There was a reason his third wife was concerned about his wandering eye.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">King Solomon</a> is credited with 700 wives and 300 concubines.
</li><li> Cù Chulainn, the champion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Irish Mythology</a>. Slept with dozens of women even <em>after</em> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyKillerInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyKillerInLove">fell head-over-heels for Emer</a>, who didn't mind as long as it was merely physical. The one time it looked like it wasn't, she verbally beat <em>both</em> into submission. Surprisingly, despite his philandering, only his coupling with Aoife produced a child, a son named Connla.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Arthurian Legend</a>, one of the few consistent facets of Sir Gawains character seems to be that, as The Knight of Maidens, women like him and he likes women... a lot.

While most knights have one or a select few love interests they are associated with, he has been associated with almost <em>30</em> (granted, this is over many centuries of material that usually arent canon to each other, but still), and after a while it even starts being mentioned that he has this reputation in-universe, and Gawains Wedding also mentions that hes been married several times, possibly in an attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding">Canon Welding</a>. The fact that his character may have been partially inspired by Cù Chulainn is probably a coincidence, however.

When you are so old that no one, including yourself and your fellow Immortals, remembers a time when you did not exist in your current form, and when you are at the same time eternally youthful and unchanging, fidelity is inevitably going to be more of a challenge than for ordinary mortals. Especially when you are the Immortal of love, passion, and ill-considered affairs.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLord">Demon Lord</a> Graz'zt is notorious for being a lustful rake. Most of his demonic servants are female (including marilith and succubi). His numerous affairs with mortals and other demons have caused him to sire numerous offspring, the most infamous being Iuz the Old, an evil demigod who rules a dark empire on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Oerth</a>.

Ironically, the one male she has outright rejected is Graz'zt, and they utterly despise each other (each of them giving a conflicting story as to why).
</li><li> On the other end of the Lower Planes, both Belial and his daughter Fierna, the co-rulers of the Fourth Hell of Phlegethos, are the same.

</li><li> Kotonoha's classmates from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em> believe that Kotonoha is this because of her popularity with the boys and her large bust.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Marena:</strong> "... Define "people."
</div><ul><li> Even before she was Exalted, her mother evidently encouraged her in this direction. When we meet her Lunar mentor Racer, who's in many ways the masculine version of her (and at the time was traveling with a couple dozen women), it all makes sense.

And after their breakup he resumed being this trope.
<ul><li> Angel the bartender is a much less positive example. Thea thought they were in a relationship. Angel thought Thea was just another friend-with-benefits. Thea found this out the hard way. Then she found out Angel didn't use protection with any of her other partners, leading to the STD testing storyline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And Thea has Restless Leg Syndrome for the rest of the comic.

The guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan">seduces women as easily as breathing</a>, and occasionally has to fight himself not to bring great loving to the nearest woman, much to his own despair later in the comic (when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">character is deepened</a>). With the exception of Winter, he's had practically every girl who's a central character, and one girly-looking guy.

</li><li> About half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeastICouldDo">Least I Could Do</a></em> is about the main character Rayne, who can and will sleep with any woman he sees and will go to insane lengths to sleep with a beautiful woman<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11u2vo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11u2vo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11u2vo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The other half is him being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> and abusing his friends</span>. It's easy to forget that the whole reason he got his insanely high-paying job was because he wanted to screw the CEO. That said, there is a list of women Rayne can't bed, which includes the comic's female lead Issa (a childhood friend who's not interested) and the wives of his friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/MagickChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/MagickChicks">Magick Chicks</a></em>: This applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">Faith</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Jacqui</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopath">Anastasia</a>:
<ul><li> It's no secret to anyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlSchool">at Artemis</a> that Faith has slept with much of the student body. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePornomancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePornomancer">her reputation</a> is so well known, that when Jacqui told the student council that Faith had skipped out on their meeting to allegedly knock boots with a teacher, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.magickchicks.com/strips-mc/your_president_needs_you">none of them doubted it for a second.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Not that Jacqui has much room to talk, considering she's banging Faith's brother, Paul, while secretly seeing Mr. Delatorre on the side. Though he isn't aware that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.magickchicks.com/strips-mc/more_convincing">he's been dating one of his students.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Anastasia's had her fair share too, as she openly admitted to not knowing who Mel's father <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraParentConception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraParentConception">could be</a></em>, since one of the perks of being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Queen of The Shadow Kingdom</span> was, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.magickchicks.com/strips-mc/super-fetus">it got her a lot of nookie.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Blue Deiter, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter">Namir Deiter</a></em>, claims this as her defining characteristic throughout most of the comic.
</li><li> Ash'waren and Zala'ess from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em>. Note that among drowolath having many lovers is not considered strange/bad and motherhood and many children is a status symbol (which makes Sarv'swati rendering Quain'tana barren in their fight an injury that goes beyond the physical).
</li><li> A few characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em> could count, though Jason may be the best example; apparently he knows some sort of mathematical formula that tells him the best possible way to seduce women. This eventually ends when he gets into a relationship with (and eventually marries) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aubrey</span>.
</li><li> Maytag of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Flipside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Flipside">Flipside</a></em>, especially in the earlier chapters, although she begins to restrain her proclivities in order to maintain her relationship with the monogamous <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bernadette</span>.
</li><li> Two examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheNoordegraafFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheNoordegraafFiles">The Noordegraaf Files</a></em>. The first, typical example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Akila</a>, the comic's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit">nymph</a>. While the exact extent to which her promiscuity extends isn't known, it's implied she has slept with at least half of the main cast. Katrina, Akila's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend">Best Friend</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">possible lover</a>) is a non - sexual example, getting a new boyfriend every few weeks - but is pretty upset about it. Dating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> is nice for a while, until you realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving">she's much more badass in your imagination than she is in real life.</a>
</li><li> Sabine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">literal incarnation of illicit sex</a>. She's in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony">steady relationship</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualGenreBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualGenreBlindness">Nale</a>, but once mentions that she had sex three times while away from him for a couple of hours. She doesn't seem to understand why he'd be upset by this.
</li><li> Ted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Greg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Greg">Greg</a></em>. Been with a bevy of women throughout the strip, but his most eye opening act that has been revealed so far, is cheating on a girl by having a threesome with her sister and room mate. It's hinted that he might have slept with her mother on a separate occasion.
</li><li> This tends to show up a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Oglaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Oglaf">Oglaf</a></em>. Some specific examples:
<ul><li> Ivan manages to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalVirgin">Technical Virgin</a> despite frequently "having sex things done to me" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">unwillingly</a>), which causes the magical virgin city of Vanorva to decry him as a slut.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief">Vanka</a> definitely qualifies, as her usual methods of escaping capture tend to involve sex with captors, guards, random bystanders....
</li></ul></li><li> Nanase from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em> is a non-sexual example of this, dating many of the boys at her school (culminating in dating Elliot) in her search for Mr. Right when she should have been looking for <em>Ms.</em>
<ul><li> Subverted with Diane, she has a reputation for this but in reality while she has dated a lot of guys she's actually a virgin, all of her exes had been lying about having slept with her. Finding out about her reputation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">really upsets her</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Porrim from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, who joked about the 'revolving doors' of her quadrants, and according to Meenah, she used up the extensive amount of spare time she and her group was gifted with by sleeping with most of her friends.
<ul><li> For a nonsexual variant, Kanaya. One of the quadrants of troll romance, auspisticism, is based around one troll keeping the relationship between two others stable. Kanaya is so eager to do this that Eridan refers to her as "the vvillage twwo wwheel devvice".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BittersweetCandyBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BittersweetCandyBowl">Bittersweet Candy Bowl</a></em> has Rachel and Jessica, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though the latter is actually an aversion, having slept with only one guy, and then only well after she obtained her reputation as a slut.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Glorianna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Glorianna">Glorianna</a></em> specializes in one-night stands, and heads for the hills (using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsequenceCombo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsequenceCombo">quest</a> as an excuse) whenever a relationship starts getting serious.
</li><li> John Jensen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FairyDust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FairyDust">Fairy Dust</a></em> is a friendly man, but his idea of fun involves seducing and sleeping with every women who will let him, especially the naughty, aggressive ones from smaller races. And being a huge, loud, flamboyantly dressed troll doesn't appear to be a hindrance to appealing to the ladies! His own family is embarrassed by his habits, despite trolls having no true notion of shame.
</li><li> Just about everyone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">Ménage à 3</a></em>, with central character Gary being an initial aversion who subsequently becomes more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPornomancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPornomancer">Accidental Pornomancer</a>. Stand-outs, even for this series, are Zii, DiDi, and Matt.
</li><li> Jan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SplitScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SplitScreen">Split Screen</a></em>. We first see her in the comic coldly dismissing an one-night stand (who seemed more amused by it than hurt). As we get to know her, it becomes clear that her mercenary approach to her love life is a coping mechanism, dealing with her feelings for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway">The One That Got Away</a>.
