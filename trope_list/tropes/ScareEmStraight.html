<div class="indent">— <em><strong>X-Entertainment</strong></em>
</div></div><p>If you've spent any time in a Western (and probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">American</a>) public school system, then you've no doubt seen one of the films, cartoons and filmstrips whose purpose is to inform bright-eyed schoolchildren about themselves and the world around them. Judging by the way many of these films turn out, however, one might suspect that there's a special wing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> set aside just to produce them.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The origin of this trope lies in the belief that children aren't very receptive to positive reinforcement, and therefore must be informed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">the least subtle way possible</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">all of the negative consequences which may befall them</a> if they do anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks">and/or</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">stupid</a>. For instance, tell little Johnny that he has a better chance of living a long healthy life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">if he avoids drugs</a>. There's a pretty good chance that he'll say "Sure" and then promptly forget every single word you just said. But, tell Johnny that he'll wind up drooling in a back alley covered with sores while jamming a dirty 8-inch long needle into his arm and smell like week-old sardine salad for the rest of his life if he takes a single puff from a joint given to him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer">The Aggressive Drug Dealer</a>, and he'll listen. He may <em>laugh</em> his disbelieving butt off, but he <em>will</em> listen.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This mentality has formed the basis of all sorts of cautionary tales, many of which employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">extreme and terrifying imagery</a> in their attempt to keep children on the straight and narrow path. Yes, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">irreversible psychological damage might occur</a>, but it <em>is</em> all for their own good, so it's okay. So what if a kid winds up a twitching vegetable afraid of venturing into the outside world? At least he won't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">get kidnapped by a lollipop-wielding child-molester</a> or hit by a bus while jaywalking and smoking crack.
</p><p>The theory is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren">when they grow older and "able to understand," adults will be able to give the "real" reasons for such mores</a>. A common reality is that there's less to stop them from engaging in that behavior once they realize that their face won't "freeze that way." Worse, the realization that they'd been fed a bunch of hooey may make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">ignore genuine and honest warnings</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Examples of some of the mind-meltingly scary imagery include: a boy getting run over by a train, vandals poisoning a deer, people in Africa contracting hideous diseases like sleeping sickness and elephantiasis, a choking victim who turns bright blue and nearly dies... Let's not even get into the bloody, windshield-cracking horrors inflicted in Driver's Ed class or what happens when people panic if the school catches on fire.
</p><p>Of course, not every child who sees these types of films will become traumatized by them. For every kid who pukes at the five-minute mark of <em>Wheels of Tragedy</em>, there will be at least one who will cheer loudly at the sight of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">karmically-induced gore</a> splashing across the screen. (A phenomenon excellently spoofed in <a class="urllink" href="http://origin.theonion.com/content/node/38588">this Onion article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
</p><p>Note: Sometimes Scare 'Em Straight campaigns will actually <em>backfire</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">the ads that were designed to admonish a certain behavior will actually encourage it and make it look cool</a>. There are those who believe <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2006/12/11/daily8.html?from_rss=1">that certain companies might be doing this sort of thing on purpose to lure in new customers.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> After all, why else would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthCigaretteCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthCigaretteCommercial">cigarette</a> and alcohol companies be so quick and eager to create ad campaigns that are supposedly <em>against</em> middle-schoolers using their products, when most new users tend to get hooked at that age? It's a debate that will probably rage on for as long as alcohol and tobacco remain available.
</p><p>Scare 'Em Straight as a whole not only covers instructional shorts, but scary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">public service announcements</a> as well. God forbid you should settle in to enjoy your Saturday Morning cartoons and your Froot-Loops without being reminded of the Lovecraftian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> which can overtake you if you fail to brush your teeth. Some politicians will use these tactics to try and scare people off voting for their opponent, which is known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareCampaign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareCampaign">Scare Campaign</a>.
</p><p>This is the modern equivalent of the (hopefully) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope">Forgotten Trope</a> of children's literature intended to scare kids into good behaviour by depicting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">Family-Unfriendly Death</a> and/or the torments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a> inflicted on "boys and girls like you". This was a common theme in older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">fairy tales</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>, but modern tellings have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication">Disneyfied</a> over time by removing the especially nasty bits and adding happy endings. In the present day, fringe Christian sects keep this tradition alive with "hell houses" that usually operate around Halloween and serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">The Moral Substitute</a> for your garden-variety secular haunted house. These are disavowed by the mainstream; however, a hell house graced the cover of <em>Newsweek</em> as recently as 2006.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0m9c1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0m9c1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0m9c1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">("Visions of Hell", by Matthew Philips and Lisa Miller, <em>Newsweek</em>, November 6, 2006, 52; also "Signaling Through the Flames: Hell House Performance and Structures of Religious Feeling" by Ann Pellegrini <a class="urllink" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_quarterly/v059/59.3pellegrini.html">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)</span>
</p><p>It could be said that the <em>large number</em> of examples on this page are a testimony to there being too much PSA time available to a vast number of specialised interest groups, each one convinced that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">their</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">anvil needs to be dropped</a>, and unaware that people become desensitized at a young age by the sheer <em>volume</em> of Scare 'Em Straight messages.

Koro-sensei draws a short comic that is presented as if it were this to Kataoka to warn her that she may grow up to be dangerously codependent if she does not learn to stand up for her own needs more. It's much funnier in the manga than how it is described here.
</li><li> Motoko Kusanagi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> does this to a group of med students. Three medical students who are well enough on their own decide to try their hand at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft">stealing organs</a> and selling them on the black market. It doesn't take much to capture the first two, but the leader of the operation runs off into the nearby warehouse. Motoko heads inside to deal with him personally. She pulls out a knife and threatens to kill him and sell his organs herself. He tries to plead and bargain with her, but she keeps advancing. She backs him into a corner, takes the knife and stabs it down at his head. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a> later, we see the kid is still alive, though he did wet his pants in fear. Motoko jammed the knife into an oil pipe right above his head. As all three students are being taken away by the police, she tells them that they all have promising educations and futures ahead of them and that they shouldn't get mixed up with illegal activities, especially ones that the Yakuza has a hand in.

</li><li> Jack Chick's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Chick Tracts</a></em>, which attempt to scare people straight quite literally in many cases, by establishing homosexuals as being ungodly deviants who corrupt the young and, in one memorable instance that people have stumbled across, outright state that the homosexual community was willing to deliberately supply HIV-infected blood to the blood transfusion network in a form of political blackmail. They're so absurdly over-the-top (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0052/0052_01.asp">"AAAHHH... my leg's on fire!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) that they're sometimes mistaken for parody, except he is <em>absolutely serious about all of this</em> and expects you to take it seriously as well. One of his more famous tracts is "Dark Dungeons," when he rails against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, claiming that players will become involved in black magic and kill themselves if anything happens to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>.
<ul><li> That tactic is also used in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.darkdungeonsthemovie.com">"Dark Dungeons: The Movie!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> His goal of scaring you into believing in God occasionally veers in a creepy direction. In one tract, a father sexually abuses his daughter and gives her gonorrhea. He then accepts Jesus and all is forgiven. His daughter magically isn't traumatized, and he suffers no legal consequences for the abuse. There's a reason that tract is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">no longer in circulation.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey">Adventures in Odyssey</a></em>, which <em>usually</em> doesn't pull this trope into effect heavily, did a similar thing in their "Castles and Cauldrons" episode, with a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> so exaggerated you had to wonder if they had watched even one or two minutes of people playing it.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is the documentary <em>Scared Straight!</em> (1978), which won the Oscar for Best Documentary Film. Several lifers in prison elaborate to a group of juvenile delinquents what prison was like, mainly indulging in lurid tales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">Prison Rape</a>. Its effectiveness as a program was pretty hit and miss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneGotFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneGotFat">One Got Fat</a></em>, a 1963 film on bicycle safety, no doubt scared many a child. Narrated by Edward Everett Horton, it featured kids in creepy paper-mache monkey masks riding their bikes to a picnic, and getting into disturbing slapstick accidents for not obeying such rules of the road as "ride alone," "watch signs", or "use lights." The kid carrying everybody's lunches obeys all the rules and makes it to the picnic grounds in one piece (he's also the only one not wearing a mask, because "he's no monkey"), but seems unconcerned with his friends' plight and eats all their lunches (hence the title of the film, "One Got Fat"). The irony being supplied by the fact that, after generations of ominous warnings about the various dangers Out There, the authorities are now worried about kids... getting, um, fat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReeferMadness">Reefer Madness</a></em> is a 1936 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">exploitation film</a> revolving around the tragic events that follow when high school students are lured by pushers to try "marihuana": a hit and run accident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToKillHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToKillHim">manslaughter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualHarassmentAndRapeTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualHarassmentAndRapeTropes">rape</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">descent into madness</a> all ensue. This one was so incredibly over-the-top, it was actually adopted by the pro-marijuana community as an indictment of the hysteria that surrounds marijuana (as well as, perhaps ironically, a really fun movie to watch while stoned). This way of looking at the film turned it into a cult classic, and even led to a <em>musical version</em>, which plays the whole thing off with a wink, a nudge, and a whole lot of catchy songs.
<ul><li> It gets better. For their 2008 <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTwenty">Four Twenty</a> celebration, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">magnificent bastards</a> at G4 debuted the movie <em>Reefie's Madhouse</em>, in which they took the original movie and gave it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a>. Like the original, it can only truly be appreciated if one is high while watching it.
</li></ul></li><li> Driver's Ed, of course, has had some classics. Like a video about road rage. Here the innocent driver goes, down the highway... and the other driver pulls over, gets a <em>crossbow</em> out of the trunk, and shoots him for not turning his high beams on. (Surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">Based on a True Story</a>! <a class="urllink" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15302476/)">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15302476/)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Or the video about wearing one's seatbelt, and especially the ones about not driving drunk. There are graphic, crash-scene photos of severed limbs, streaks of brains and blood on the pavement leading up to a now-headless body, a body impaled on a tree limb about ten feet in the air, and a partial decapitation — the head had been split horizontally at about nose-level. People have been known to faint halfway through.
</li><li> With the slow and steady rise of actual road rage incidents involving weaponry, this is starting to quality for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/spclm/010903eng.pdf">4% of Canadians were victims of road rage violence in 2001.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> There is plenty of this in Driver's Ed. One might recall, for example, the film titled <em>Red Asphalt III</em>. Just about every video, at least one shown each class for 4 weeks, began with no less than 3-5 minutes (and sometimes up to 10) of gory footage and a deep-voiced narration of the tale of Johnny Everyteen and his friends getting drunk at a Sweet 16 party and driving to their corpse-mangling doom... immediately followed by Willie Nelson's "On the Road Again" and a cheerful old man ready to teach us how to drive.
</li><li> Oh, just pray you never do defensive driving online. The videos they make you watch on those pages... one of them, an anti-drunk-driving one, featured the tagline... "Matthew wanted to celebrate winning the big game. So he killed his best friend." Less Scared Straight, more Scared Into Laughing My Ass Off.
</li><li> The film "Trashed" dissuades new drivers from drunk driving by showing unedited footage of the emergency room after horrific DUI-related crashes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMarksTheSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMarksTheSpot">"X" Marks the Spot</a></em>, produced by the New Jersey DMV and eventually featured on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>, shows that you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">will die on your way home</span> if you so much as run a stop sign. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2t1w0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2t1w0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2t1w0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The main character's other driving habits are exaggerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> as well.</span>
</li><li> By the 1970s, there were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">Public Service Announcements</a> with crash test dummy footage of the consequences of drivers and passengers not wearing their seatbelts in auto accidents. While they avoided the gruesomeness of the above instructional films, the slow motion imagery of the dummies flying about and smashing into things made its point.
</li><li> Today, most driver's education films shown in class have disclaimers, warning viewers that they could expect to see the grim aftermath of accidents showed photos and live-action film  people lying in pools of blood, mangled beyond recognition, severely burned, and  if not dead  in various states of consciousness. Beforehand, these films did not have these disclaimers, meaning that someone seeing the remains of a high school quarterback and homecoming queen being extricated from a wrecked car and loaded into a hearse  and the events leading up to it (perhaps they were out drinking, or someone else was)  could be shown without warning ... and enough to scare the viewer straight and send an intended message. (Or enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">cause a crippling phobia of motor vehicles</a>.)
</li><li> But with computer-aided special effects, driver's education movies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">Public Service Announcement</a> films pitching driver safety have often gone back to being stunningly graphic. An example that comes to mind is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyStwpdCowzTxtNDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyStwpdCowzTxtNDrive">Only Stwpd Cowz Txt N Drive</a></em>, a British PSA that warns of the dangers of texting while driving. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yzg3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yzg3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yzg3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">''Only Stwpd Cows ...

Later in the film, one of the deceased victims is shown in the morgue as her parents are asked to confirm the identify of her body.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in-universe in the comedy <em>Moving Violations</em>, in which the traffic-school class has to watch a gory PSA called "Blood On The Highway." Subverted in that one of the attendees is a die-hard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">horror movie addict</a> and thoroughly <em>enjoys</em> the showing.

It was made in 1991, but is still a popular choice for beginner labs for preteen students all the way through college labs. Highlights include the "glassware to the palm," the "camera bath," rampant mannequin abuse, and a demonstration of the safety shower complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">uncomfortably attentive classmate</a>.

</div></li><li> <em>One Last Shot</em>, a hunter education film. In it, two kids go hunting (without permission, no less). One kid pretty much forgets every rule of hunting (he wasn't paying attention during the class). Then, the same kid finishes shooting and runs downhill to get the targets, his friend warning him that he's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">one last shot</a>. He trips and drops his gun, which fires and shoots his friend; the friend dies in surgery, the kid gets legal action against him, and that's the film. Much less graphic than many of the things on this page, with the only truly graphic part being the surgery  just brief shots of blood pools. Still scary, though.

This film was considered so graphic and controversial that it was quickly replaced with 1979 <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxXDw3WOGQs">Robbie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a PSA about a boy who loses his legs and can no longer play football. "Robbie" itself was eventually replaced with another PSA, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HzAuSA8Syk">Killing Time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> in 1992, which depicts a fictional teenager being killed on the rails, a constable picking up pieces of his body after the fact, and <em>actual post-mortem photography of people killed by railway trespass</em>.
</li><li> There's this VHS called "The Dangers of Smoking" that shows this smoking cessation class watching an old video that shows graphic cancer surgery and then shows this cancer patient with a huge chin speaking in a deep voice. It then shows a montage of photos of his chin getting bigger and the last photo showed his dead corpse. VERY grotesque!
</li><li> The animated Sam the Safety Duck discusses school bus safety in a 1977 film produced for Ontario's Ministry of Transportation and Communications, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqdZQFCkLIs">Sam on the Buses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, circa 1970s. It has graphic scenes of what happens when you stick your head out of a window and vice versa. The worst scene in that film shows a mischievous student scaring the bus driver, which cuts to several scenes of school bus crash tests showing huge buses crashing into brick walls with the child dummies inside them being tossed around like leaves in a salad while scary xylophone music plays. Other films were produced with Sam, including <em>Sam on Winter Safety</em> and <em>Sam the Safety Duck Learns to Drive a Bicycle</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWeekend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWeekend">The Lost Weekend</a></em>, though not explicitly an educational film, depicts the protagonist's descent into alcoholism very much this way.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Struwwelpeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Struwwelpeter">Struwwelpeter</a></em> is a classic (1845) German children's book that warns the reader against misdemeanors like not trimming their nails or playing with matches with rather gruesome cautionary tales. One of them, for example, features a boy who sucks his thumb, so a tailor (the "Great Red-Legged Scissor-man") comes out of nowhere and cuts his thumbs off with a pair of scissors.
</li><li> In one of Edward Goreys poems, a child with a name corresponding to each letter of the alphabet is given a death scenario, such as drowning or being hit by a train. While it seems like a childrens book, its more of a cautionary tale. The skeletal man and the Burtonesque drawings dont help. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor">CollegeHumor</a> parodied the poem in their video The A-Z of Things That Will Kill You, narrated by the skeletal man. For a comedic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel, this particular video is rather nihilistic, although thankfully nowhere near as gruesome as the poem it was based on.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em>, Peachy used to suck his thumb as a child. As a grown man (not to mention a violent gangster and thug), he suddenly finds himself in a world based on a child's mind - he is unfazed until the Scissor Man <em>actually appears</em>. He flees in terror and is never seen again.
<ul><li> The previous governess of the novel's two children was apparently a great believer in this trope, making up all manner of monsters to threaten Twyla and Gawain into proper behavior. Susan finds it exasperating to no end, having to beat these prohibitory monsters into submission once she becomes their governess.
</li><li> Jenny Green-Teeth, a monster encountered by Tiffany in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWeeFreeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWeeFreeMen">The Wee Free Men</a></em>, is identified by Miss Tick as a creation of parents who wanted to scare their kids out of playing too near the water.
</li><li> In some of the watch books Detritus runs a Scare Em Straight campaign aimed at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">drug dealers</a> putting up posters with "Slab: Just say AarrghaarrghpleasennononoUGH". Actual drug dealers that Detritus catches with Slab will be <em>nailed to the wall</em>, so it's a fair warning.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaireBelloc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilaireBelloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> wrote a series which is the English equivalent of <em>Struwwelpeter</em>. It includes <em>Cautionary Tales</em>, <em>A Moral Alphabet</em>, and <em>A Good Child's Book Of Beasts</em>. Things like getting blown up, crushed by falling statuary, and eaten by lions happened to bad children. However, the stories are all in verse and have a kind of ghoulish glee about them, suggesting that they're not necessarily supposed to be taken totally seriously.
<ul><li> This was also parodied in a cutaway gag on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>.
</li><li> This character has gained a sort of tongue-in-cheek fame in Finland. There is a famous children's song named after him that's basically 'stop telling boring stories!'
</li><li> The Red-Legged Scissor Man, along with several creatures like him, appear in <em>The Fourth Bear</em>, a novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperFforde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperFforde">Jasper Fforde</a>. There's a village where these monsters <em>actually exist</em>, and the children are downright <em>creepily</em> obedient, in order to avoid the possibility of thumbs being snipped off and suchlike. While definitely both Nightmare Fuel and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a> for the children, the effect this has on them, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> creepiness, is also Nightmare Fuel in the books (both in-universe, for people who haven't grown up in the village, and for the reader). For decades the parents had decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>, but eventually the parents rebel, demanding normal things like teenage arguments and untidy bedrooms (things they never got a chance to experience as children either ...).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The History of the Fairchild Family</em>, a popular Victorian Sunday school prize, had lots of these, including a child nearly dying of a fever for eating stolen plums, a father taking his quarreling daughters on a walk in the woods to see a dead man hanging on a gibbet, and another girl burning to death while playing with a candle. Later editions either toned down or completely removed the latter two incidents.
</li><li> The <em>Mrs. Piggle Wiggle</em> series had the desperate parents of naughty children going to an old lady in a weird house and getting strange concoctions to teach their children the error of their ways. Often involved magical candy.
</li><li> An entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">discredited</a> subtrope of this are the tales, often presented through allegory, of young women who place unwise trust in male strangers, slip into their abodes, and are never seen alive again. Famous fables of this type include "Little Red Riding Hood" (before the Brothers Grimm version introduced a hunter to save the day) and "The Spider and the Fly."

</li><li> German author Gudrun Pausewang does this so well, it makes her the queen of HONF. Most (in)famous example: <em>Die letzten Kinder von Schewenborn</em> (The last kids of Schewenborn), about the life of an ordinary German family during and after global thermonuclear war. Including excessive descriptions of radiation sickness, mutilated people, lots of children dying (incl. all the siblings of the narrator), a baby born eyeless and armless, the mother of the family going mad and forcing the family to return to Frankfurt, which she believes wasn't destroyed (of course it was, being one of Germany's most important cities), and also the description of the helplessness of the people. She also wrote books about a nuclear power plant going Chernobyl in Germany, the poorness of people in third-world country, another right-wing populist taking power in Germany, and a biography of young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Some of these books even got prizes for being (supposedly) good literature.
</li><li> Danish fairytale legend Hans Christian Andersen. <em>Everywhere</em>. Most blatant example: You go to hell for a "C" school note equivalent. No, I'm not making this up, read "Ole Lukøje."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlotteTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlotteTemple">Charlotte Temple</a></em>, by Susanna Rowson, is a badly-written, overdone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a>, ham-fisted morality tale laden with hackneyed stereotypes; it was also the bestselling novel in America from its publication in 1794 to when it was finally overturned by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em> in <em>1852.</em> <em>Charlotte Temple</em> is the story of a young English girl who, sincerely in love, runs away with a soldier to America, beyond her family's ability to help her. Her soldier then abandons the girl when she's pregnant for a prettier, wealthier model, leaving Charlotte to eventually beg in the streets, and get a "happy" ending in that she dies in her father's arms.
</li><li> Arguably deconstructed in Theodore Thomas' short story, "Test," where a man applying for his driver's license experiences a horrific accident through hypnosis. The end of the story hints that no one gets a license  those applicants who still want to drive after experiencing that are presumed insane and dragged away to an asylum.
</li><li> "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" was told to scare children who lie all the time. (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a>.)
</li><li> Jean Valjean attempts this in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>. When a young fop of a street thug, Montparnasse, tries to mug him, Valjean asks why, and Montparnasse retorts that he's lazy and honest work is hard. Valjean, who spent nineteen years in prison for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">Felony Misdemeanor</a> of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family (and a few escape attempts), is disgusted, and gives him a vivid description of how Montparnasse's criminal laziness could very well land him in prison, where the work is so backbreakingly awful that honest employment looks like a restful paradise in comparison. When this doesn't work on its own, Valjean points to Montparnasse's fine clothes and fancy hair and says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">he'd be shaved bald and issued a hideous uniform</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">This part seems to have some effect.</a>
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> is that the tour of the factory is Willy Wonka's way of scaring the naughty kids and coddling parents in the Golden Ticket tour group straight by leading them into situations where disobedience has ridiculous, disastrous effects on them. Even if one doesn't go with that interpretation, the novel and adaptations thereof do make for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">blackly funny</a> morality play for kids. And in-universe, the Oompa-Loompa song regarding Violet  mostly recounting the sad story of Miss Bigelow, who chewed so much she eventually bit her tongue in two, went insane, and was confined to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse">Bedlam House</a>  is certainly this trope!

</li><li> This was the point of most of <em>Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories</em>. In the typical story, a small child would do something naughty (or fail to give themselves over to the Lord) and end up suffering horrible consequences, no matter how mundane their misbehavior was. Kids, do the dishes when your mother asks you to or else you will asphyxiate in the resulting housefire.

Through graphic traumatizing deceit, fake blood, and a fake arm, he managed to burn into the kids' minds that everything from talking too loud in the car, to leaving the house without putting a note on the fridge will inevitably end in someone's arm being ripped off.
<ul><li> Although Lindsay came away from the "fridge note" incident thinking he wanted them to avoid dairy somehow.
</li><li> George Sr. also hosted a "Scared Straight" presentation at the Church and State Fair. Accidentally walking into the Church one, he ended up telling a bunch of young gay men about a place where you work out and have sex with other men without anyone treating it like a big deal, and was asked if there was a cover charge. Funnily enough, his <em>original</em> plan of talking about the horrors of his house confinement and constant sex with Lucille, along with visual aids, might have been more effective here (though a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine">Strong Medicine</a></em>, Andy is rocked when boyfriend Milo is killed by a drunk driver at an accident. The teen comes to Andy to ask for forgiveness with her naturally cold to him. He does get to talking to Jesse. At the prom, Jesse and the guy appear to be massively drunk and are kicked out. A loud crash is heard and the students race out to see the duo inside a crashed car, blood all over them and Andy sobbing. It turns out the whole thing was staged as the trio (especially the young man) want to show these kids the consequences of driving drunk and thinking it's no big deal.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, there's a scene of some elementary school kids sitting in on a gangbanger's autopsy while someone lectures them about the dangers of a life of crime. But they don't seem particularly fazed at all. The coroner later jokes that it was more "bored stiff" than "scared straight."
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>, we see a flashback wherein Harry takes young Dexter to watch an execution, telling him that this is what will happen to him if he doesn't follow the Code.
</li><li> Played for laughs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> as Kelly is now working at a low-rent diner. A teacher from her school comes by with a pack of vapid, flighty girls who are basically Kelly wannabes. When they see the former highly popular Queen Bee of the school at a dead-on job, the girls are soon racing to get to the library and start studying.
</li><li> Parodied on a regular sketch on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, which has a group of prison inmates trying to "scare straight" a trio of teens, inevitably by retelling the plot of some film or the like. Usually, the horrible consequences the inmates use are based on story elements that aren't that horrible, actually.
<ul><li> A notable installment has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> playing "herself" and her "horrible crimes" are quickly recognized as just the plots of her various movies.

Amusingly, Sally comes in later so that the two of them can watch it together... backwards, so that it has a <em>happy</em> ending.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sally</strong>: Her head came back on!
</div></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction">Police, Camera, Action!</a></em> had a group of self-confessed speeding drivers who were taken to a mock-up of an accident scene where a motorist was doing at least 60 miles in a 30-mile zone. The car he hit was of a married couple and their three-month old daughter who was reported as not breathing when the ambulance arrived. The daughter survived  they brought her out in a wheelchair and the mother explained that she needed round-the-clock care (two carers during the day, one during the night) and that if they removed a device around her neck, she would die. A few of the group were horrified and promised never to speed again; one stated that they would only speed "if it was safe to do so."
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyDown">Party Down</a></em>, after catching Henry and Constance smoking marijuana, Ron produces a photo he uses whenever he's tempted to use to scare them straight. He had a friend who smoked pot, and one time he got drunk and crashed the company van and got his foot amputated. The photo is of "a leg made footless by pot."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em> features a parody anti-music piracy ad which states that pirating music is equivalent to stealing a policeman's helmet, murdering him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">shitting in his helmet,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">presenting his shit-filled helmet to his grieving widow,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and then stealing it again.</a> And it implies that the punishment if you're caught pirating is summary execution.
</li><li> Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury">Maury</a>'s guests would be victims of domestic abuse. Their abusive partners would be talked to onstage, then a big, buff man (usually a prison-guard, or a former abuser, or a cop) would take them out for a day or so. First they went to a prison to see where they would be if they kept hurting their partners and then they were taken to a coroner, to see <em>the dead body of an abuse victim.</em> The guy in charge would then force the abusers to take a good, long look at her and basically tell them "This could be <em>your</em> partner." A "Where are they now?" segment would be brought up at the end, mentioning that some of those couples were currently getting help.
<ul><li> They also do this with the "delinquent teenager" episodes. Usually the girls (most of whom will admit to sleeping with any man that agrees because they want a baby) will be lectured by women who were teen moms, and usually the older girls will let them take care of the baby for a day. Often, at the same time, they'll be taken to this inside of a prison and screamed at by female inmates.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></em> had an episode called "Steered Straight". The boys are taken into a cop car, and on the way to the station, the officer who picked them up stops at a gas station robbery. Unfortunately, the robber steals the cop car and the boys are forced to pretend to be criminals so the robber won't know they're innocent. Of course, hilarity ensues.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> episode "The Convict". Michael attempts to seriously warn the office of how horrible and frightening prison is by using this technique as he pretends to be a rebellious ex-convict, with ridiculous reasons of why to avoid prison... like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Dementors</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes">The Young Ones</a></em> has a parody of a road safety PSA in which a cricket bat with a brick tied to it represents a car, and various squishy foodstuffs represent vulnerable pedestrians. This was a parody of a real road safety campaign that had aired a few years previously, using the image of a hammer smashing a peach to represent people being run over.
</li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em>. The Captain (a sort of costumed public relations guy for the precinct) tries bringing in a young juvenile offender to show him around and try to put a scare into him about crime. It not only doesn't work, when Mick lays into The Captain with a tirade that includes "people don't scare him, he scares people", the kid in turns lays into the officer with a death threat. The Captain <em>still</em> thinks he's getting somewhere.
</li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> episodes have featured shorts that were supposed to invoke this, but their over-the-topness leads them to being mocked. Besides the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMarksTheSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMarksTheSpot">"X" Marks the Spot</a></em> short, others have included:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastClearChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastClearChance">Last Clear Chance</a></em>, a short showing that you should never horse around railroad crossings. Y'know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">"Why don't they just look?"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cheating">Cheating</a></em>, a short showing you that if you cheat once, the entire world will <em>hate</em> you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDaysOfOurYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDaysOfOurYears">The Days of Our Years</a></em>, another short by the same group who did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastClearChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastClearChance">Last Clear Chance</a></em>, that shows that no matter what happens, you will get hurt or die. No exceptions.
<ul><li> Notably, that one managed to at least vaguely disturb the riffers at one point. More specifically, the part where a guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">gets his eyes burned by a welding torch.</a>

When the woman smugly says she'll be happy being a "martyr to the cause" and that the only people hurt by the group are greedy developers, the team bring in the civilian who'd been trying to lure out the group she represents; Joel was eleven years old when that same group started a fire, his mother dying trying to get him out and Joel left with such horrific burns over most of his body that he barely looks human. Seeing such clear first-hand evidence of the effects of such actions is enough for the girl to give up her partners, and she tearfully apologises to Joel for what happened to him.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em> has a group of prisoners excited to take part in a scared straight program, where they have to yell at delinquent teenage girls. The prisoners even practice for the role.
</li><li> Classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> in the 60s and 70s indulges in this from time to time, because the show was originally conceived as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment">Edutainment</a>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> Public Service Broadcasts aimed at children were omnipresent in the UK in the Seventies, and because the reason <em>Doctor Who</em> exists is to scare the Krotons out of children. A few examples:
<ul><li> "The Web of Fear" contains a non-plot-important sequence when Jamie hops down onto the Underground train tracks and the Doctor launches into a lecture, complete with panicking and impassioned hand gestures:
<div class="indent">Jamie, no! Don't move! Don't touch the rails. Whatever you do, stand still! Stand still. Don't move. Keep quite still, Jamie. ...Oh, it's all right. You can relax. The electricity is off. If there had been a current running through these rails, you'd have been fried! Electrified! Brunched! Burnt up! Now, come along. It's safe now, I think, but we'd better be careful. Follow me.
</div></li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> sequence where Jo gets a piece of plastic sprayed over her airway by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheKillerWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheKillerWhatever">killer fake daffodil</a>, the Doctor gives a lecture about the dangers of suffocation from plastic sheets, mentioning that you only need four inches square of plastic to suffocate and you will be unconscious in two minutes and dead in ten. This was a hot topic at the time, as plastic bags were a new development.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a>,</em> Ducky serves this function when the rest of the team is unable to break the perp.

</li><li> The fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver">Canada's Worst Driver</a></em> is set in an abandoned prison complex. In the first episode, the drivers who have engaged in outright criminal driving behavior in the past are placed in prison cells for a few minutes to drive home what could happen to them if they don't shape up.
</li><li> Played for laughs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodGirls">Good Girls</a></em>. When Ruby discovers her daughter Sara has been helping sell off stolen goods at school, she gets a cop friend to "scare" Sara with a trip to a jail. However, sharing the cell as well, it's <em>Ruby</em> who gets freaked out as (having secretly gotten involved in several robberies and working for a local gang boss) she realizes just how terrible jail is going to be for her and begs to be let out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin">Steve Martin</a>'s 1980 comedy special <em>Comedy Is Not Pretty</em> parodies these kind of ads in two sketches:
<ul><li> He plays a drunken reveler whose friends don't take his keys come morning, and he ends up weaving all over the street and running over a child chasing a ball  not with his car, mind you, but with his <strong>steamroller</strong>. Not only do the kid and his ball end up flattened in a gag straight out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>, the steamroller is realistically depicted as moving <strong>very slowly</strong> and the kid has plenty of time to notice and step out of the way, yet the collision is presented as if Martin were driving a car at 50 miles per hour!
</li><li> He later plays a convenience store owner who makes the mistake of not selling his stock of plutonium <em>under the counter</em>, which means a pair of terrorists are able to shoplift some after he turns down their initial request for it (because they didn't bring a note permitting them to buy it).
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em> has Walker helping a former gang member (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>) who's turned his life around to run a youth center. Members of rival gangs converge with the young kids and it looks like a fight is about to break out. Walker arrives with some ex-cons who quickly educate the kids to how gang life leads to prison or the grave. One even shows off the scar from an eye he lost in a fight in jail.

<ul><li> "YOLO" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland">The Lonely Island</a> spoofs the "you only live once" meme and the backlash against its risk-promoting nature by being the diametric opposite: a song telling the listener to avoid doing <em>anything</em> risky, to the point of not going outside, boarding up your windows, wearing a straitjacket for protection, and pulling out all your teeth so you don't accidentally bite your tongue. At the end of the song, it is pointed out that YOLO also stands for "you oughta look out".

<ul><li> The Christian play <em>Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames</em>. It's a series of vignettes where people die and stand before the gates of Heaven. If they accepted Christ beforehand, they're allowed in. If not, cue the creepy music as Satan comes out and drags the "heathen" off to Hell, whose only crime in many cases was skipping church that week. The play is based on the Evangelist belief that only those who worship Jesus  and do it <em>the correct way</em>  are allowed into Heaven, regardless of how good or bad they were in life; everyone else goes to Hell. Indeed, most of the people condemned weren't bad people at all. This is the point; to an Evangelist, simply being a decent person isn't enough.

<ul><li> A multitude of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> try to scare teens out of sex, with stories of horrible fates that can befall them when they drive off into the wilderness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Usually it ends with one or both of them being murdered by some maniac</a>, but one story has two teens having sex on top of a mountain during a thunderstorm and getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">struck by lightning, killing the girl and fusing their bodies together</a>, leaving the terrified boy trying to call 911 with his tongue fused to hers.
<ul><li> Another version involves only the genitals being fused together, and the boy is so traumatized that he throws up in the girl's mouth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">The smell of the vomit attracted a bear, which proceeded to eat the girl's face.</a> Oh, and the boy didn't even <em>have</em> a phone, so he had to drag himself and the girl's half-eaten corpse to the highway, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">traumatizing some Girl Scouts along the way</a>.

</li><li> Plus it's rather sexist since it's always the girl that gets killed. However, it's subverted a bit in that, while the boy survives, the ordeal's going to leave him super-traumatized and disfigured for life (at least the girl's Resting In Peace).
</li></ul></li><li> There are also anti-drug <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a>, like the story of the baby sitter who took LSD and "Baked a turkey"?

Since Andrew Ryan has an almost obsessive need to keep his underwater city secret, the exhibit was designed to discourage Rapture's youth from wanting to visit the surface.

Series host Bill Cosby warns at the beginning of the episode that some graphic language is used, and indeed it is: When Albert and his buddies are given the prison tour by a police officer, they hear lots of hooting and lurid comments from the inmates. Even without the use of strong profanity, the remarks that various inmates make about wanting the kids to join them in their cell (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">so they can have sex with them</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">which was made worse with Bill Cosby's rape scandal</a>))  not to mention the strong commentary from two of the other inmates about not having any rights or freedoms, and the strong probability of lost opportunities once released  is enough to convince the gang to stay out of trouble and the hell away from people like Rudy's buddy, who got them in trouble in the first place.

Made even better when you consider that the real purpose of this special wasn't revealed until it aired! Instead, all the ads displayed it as a fun adventure starring all the big cartoon stars of the day. Cue deer-in-headlights look on parents' faces when their seven-year old-son turned to them and asked what marijuana was. Keep in mind that this aired in 1990, when marijuana was still illegal.

They used the time to brainstorm about their next film project.
<ul><li> And it was a white-collar prison  the kids thought the whole setup was pretty sweet. Coach McGuirk even commented that the cells were better than his apartment.
</li><li> Another episode had Brendon filming a cautionary warning about putting marbles in your nose, which led to a rash of kids (and one teacher) putting marbles in their noses  of course, it had a metal song in it with the lyrics "Don't put marbles in your nose/Put them in there/Do not put them in there!"

Good thing, too  the way Finland is crammed full of nature means that each winter fills the country with open, inviting death traps. Falling through lake ice doesn't dick around but kills you in a hurry.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode "Prick Up Your Ears", the school brings in a PSA group advocating for abstinence in the most hyperbolic terms possible. Such claims include "Sex turns straight people gay and gays into Mexicans", "If you have sex, your penis will fall off, and land in another dimension, populated entirely by dogs, who will eat it", and "If you have sex, you're automatically in Al-Qaeda".
<ul><li> Another episode has Brian required to retake the DMV test to renew his license, and Stewie makes a "driving safety" video in the style of the old scare-em-straight gore fests, except with himself poorly edited into playing all the roles. If that wasn't bad enough, most of the video is just the characters talking about getting oral sex while driving.

Unfortunately, 15 minutes after putting young Duckman in a cell, the chief tipped over his chair and hit his head on a radiator, putting him in a coma for 18 months. No one else knew why he was in there, and his father never came back for him, so Duckman ended up staying in prison until the chief woke up and let him out. All this resulted in was giving Duckman a crippling fear of enclosed spaces.

Kaeloo decides to pull a scare 'em straight by lying to them that they'll turn into rabbits if they keep eating them.

<ul><li> In criminology and studies of delinquent rehabilitation, Scared Straight programs are infamous for being, well, bullshit. Almost no credible scientific evidence has ever backed up that these programs reduce rates of delinquent re-offending (recidivism), and in fact many studies demonstrate the exact opposite trend occurring, as noted in the blurb above. For example, delinquent teens sent off to boot camp-style rehab programs often come out of them having learned new techniques for running faster, climbing higher, and building up their muscles. Basically, they're being <em>trained</em> to be better criminals.
<ul><li> Scare tactics that involve showing criminals that they will get caught are pretty efficient, though. How scary the punishment itself is turns out to be largely irrelevant; it is the danger of being caught that scares them away from criminal behaviour.
</li></ul></li><li> Any anti-drug PSA inevitably backfires for the same reason as above. The biggest risks are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer">The Aggressive Drug Dealer</a>, and many, many of the commercials use either imagery or just outright say that you'll waste away to a hollow the skeleton on the first drink/puff. However, since the ads are aimed at teenagers who are already in the state of distrusting or outright disliking "the man", if they decide to try a drug and like it, they come to conclusion that <em>all</em> the negative things they've been told about drugs are untrue.
<ul><li> Before anti-drug PSAs, the U.S. had "scientific temperance instruction" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This was lurid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader">Dry Crusader</a> propaganda pushed on the public schools by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The material trafficked in pseudoscientific hysteria about the dangers of alcohol and was explicitly aimed at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyMotivatedTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyMotivatedTeacher">recruiting children into the temperance movement</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The old flour sack baby assignment you would be given in health class. With more advanced technology, this assignment has been upgraded. It now includes a realistic, electronic baby doll that cries at more or less random intervals, even in the middle of the night, needing to be "fed," "changed," or "rocked." Included with some sets of dolls is a "crack baby," which, once switched on, cries almost all the time in a far more high-pitched and desperate tone than the other dolls.
</li><li> Students at a school in Oceanside, California were told that some of their classmates had been killed in drunk driving accidents. Most of them were sad, some cried hysterically. Hours later, it was revealed that their friends were alive, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25123570">the whole thing was a hoax to scare 'em straight.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> This must have "inspired" a few schools, because this also happened in Marysville, Washington in 2008. Complete with candle light vigil and tearful speeches given by the students' mothers, and no indication that it was false during the assembly.

</li><li> There's a less extreme version of this at many schools. They have a person dressed as the grim reaper to come get you. For the rest of the day, you aren't allowed to talk at all or be called on in class. Then, at the end of the day, there is an assembly with all the kids selected laying down pretending to be dead while someone talks about the dangers of drunk driving.
</li></ul></li><li> Anyone who lived in Ontario around 1998-2000 while in grades one and two was probably scared shitless by the Ontario Hydro Diorama. Essentially, it was a little model town filled with kids doing various stupid things with electricity, such as flying kites too close to hydro lines or jamming forks in toasters. The presenter explained the obvious danger in the below situation before pressing a button that caused the kid to light up like a Christmas tree, spew sparks, and let out an indescribably horrific zapping sound. There was also a similar version brought to 3-5th graders by a electrical company in Maine, depicting things like kids being killed via electrocution when trying to retrieve a soccer ball from a power plant.
<ul><li> They also had a similar one about house fires, including a kid lighting matches in a closet full of clothes and someone falling asleep with a lit cigarette; after the presenter explained the danger, the rooms would light up like they were in flames and the presenter would tell you a gruesome story about dying in a fire.

<div class="indent">"I was thrown from a horse and I had a laminectomy and I ended up in the San Francisco General Hospital. I was operated on by the same physician who had operated on the late Jayne Mansfield's son Zoltan when he was mauled by the lion."
</div></li><li> Hell and similar concepts in many religions are examples of this.
<ul><li> This gets parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>: apparently, there's a whole realm that deals with little stuff that Hell ignores, like drinking bad milk and stealing extra ketchup packets. It's called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck">Heck</a>," and it's ruled by the pitchspork-wielding Prince of Insufficient Light. Scott Adams came up with this idea when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> kept him from making a strip involving Satan.
</li><li> Mick Stevens' <em>Poodles From Hell</em> (1984) goes into detail about Purgatory: who goes there (people who drink right out of the bottle or eat from the second layer of chocolates before finishing the top) and what happens (you are put on the staff of Heaven, chauffeurs, waitresses, etc., and are subjected to a wide range of petty annoyances).
</li></ul></li><li> In the US, tobacco companies have begun to put images on the outsides of cigarette boxes, depicting things such as rotting teeth, bleeding brains, and other things.
<ul><li> Australia's recently gone a step further  in addition to the photos of what smoking can do to the human body (and yes, we're talking full-blown photos of the real deal for those who weren't sure), tobacco companies are now limited to plain packaging, meaning no colourful logos or eye-catching boxes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> detailed a story from his youth about how his father sent him to the police station with a note that told the desk sergeant to lock him in a cell for ten minutes. When he was let out, the sergeant told him, "This is what we do to naughty boys." It instilled in him a lifelong fear of the Man, as evidenced by its use as a recurring theme in several of his movies.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> tells this same story on himself. He was opening boxes of cereal in a grocery store to see if any of them had the one premium of a collect'em all set he did not have.
</li></ul></li><li> Dentists may often have pictures of their worst cases or pictures of people who didn't take care of their teeth at <em>all</em> on their walls, or charts showing signs of periodontitis or gingivitis. Packs of cigarettes sometimes have similar photos involving mouth cancer.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(experiment)">The Third Wave<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." Originating as a high school experiment to teach students how German citizens were blinded to the Jewish Holocaust of WWII, also a book and a couple of movie adaptations. Seriously freaky stuff; some people have said, on watching accounts of it, that they could see themselves most likely joining in the Wave right from the start. It started in a classroom, and spread to the entire school, evolving a prejudice against non-members and basically turning said school into a small scale version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dissimile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dissimile">with less killing</a>.
</li><li> Many sex-ed programs  regardless of whether they preach safe sex or abstinence  will show pictures of STD-ridden genitals to drive the point home.
</li><li> The Drivers Ed films "Red Asphalt I, II, III, IV, V" is basically just a compilation of video footage shot at the scene of particularly grisly car wrecks.
<ul><li> Driver's Ed in general tends to trend this way in most Western countries. This is not entirely without reason, as most major cities gain a few new gruesome examples of the results of bad driving every <em>week</em>. And the victims are, almost <em>invariably</em>, the ones who didn't listen to the warnings from their elders/teachers/what have you. Scare 'Em Straight is tolerated far more for driver's education than in other places because it's proven over and over again to be the most effective way of teaching the consequences of unsafe driving.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of British children have been to "Firm foundations", a day out set specifically for this trope. The one which sticks in people's memory is when the site stages a kidnapping of the children, with up to the two members of staff staring evilly at a group of terrified 10-11 year olds before finally letting them know that it was all a test on stranger danger.
</li><li> Some of the more radical churches in the USA will host what are essentially 'Scare 'Em Straight fests' called "Hell House", often on Halloween. These are sort-of like your typical carnival haunted house. The notable difference being: instead of zombies popping out at you or what not, each of the rooms/scenes you're lead through will feature 'immoral acts'  such as gay marriage, under-aged sex, etc.  or terrible things happening to people who participate in said 'immoral acts.' It often ends in hell. As in, a recreation of the commonly-held Western image of hell (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">fire, lots of red, etc., etc.</a>). A man dressed as Satan will usually be screaming at you at this point. One fictional depiction occurs <a class="urllink" href="https://www.somethingpositive.net/sp10042006.shtml">in this series of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em> strips, during which <a class="urllink" href="https://www.somethingpositive.net/sp10192006.shtml">he learned that some even have<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "9/11 rooms".
<div class="indent"><strong>Randy</strong>: Secondly, the "Holy Ghost Stories" storyline upset some people  including my father. I made a promise to my dad long ago to avoid certain topics. Sadly, when I was researching the Hell Houses and learned some did incorporate a 9/11 room (one even centered around an entire terrorist attack)... well, I sort of lost it. Normally my storylines are about exaggeration. In regards to hell houses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">I found myself trying to understate things and omit some acts that occur</a> that filled me with WAY too much rage.
</div></li><li> Some High Schools like to put wrecked cars near the entrance around prom time to show kids "This is what happens when you drink at prom!"
</li><li> Heck, some schools have a whole assembly based around this. There are plenty of "rehabilitated" drunk drivers who travel around and speak at high schools about how it ruined their lives. Unlike most of the examples on this page, though, the effects of the accident are not exaggerated.
</li><li> The US military does a similar thing, except that the "rehabilitated" drunk driver is an actual driver who survived who also provides pictures of how she or he looked before the accident, when the medics arrived (severed limbs optional), and, if they were lucky, after several sessions of reconstructive surgery.
</li><li> This is actually a custom in several cultures. There's a (North) American Indian tribe where parents told their kids if they didn't behave, some fantasy beings (actually disguised relatives or friends) would come and take them away. So the kids will be actually scared if these beings appear, only to be saved by the caring family. (And later, there's even a ceremony where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> is unveiled, so to speak.)
<ul><li> Actually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> or his sidekick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKrampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKrampus">The Krampus</a> also supposedly take naughty children with them, too... actually, what exactly they do with the kids is rarely if ever said...
</li></ul></li><li> Some US high schools now have a component of their sex ed classes for the younger grades, if this is a school that has sex ed taught by older students. One of the students will come in crying on the last day and explain how she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">(it's always a girl)</a> went to some foreign country and got AIDS and the various horrible things that have happened to her since. Her boyfriend dumped her, she's dying, she can't go to college and so on. Eventually she'll run out of the room in tears and then the others will explain that this is a true story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToFear">or it could be</a>, but it's not hers and the girl doesn't have AIDS. Basic emotional manipulation.
<ul><li> Sex ed classes taught by guest speakers sometimes have a guest speaker that's quite obviously pregnant, and they're sometimes quite young (sometimes even in high school). However, instead of the intended "That could be me!", it tends to become "why is this hypocrite telling <em>me</em> not to have sex?" Perhaps the most infamous case of this in the US was the Bristol Palin abstinence campaign.
</li></ul></li><li> On a more adult level, the famous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U219eUIZ7Qo">1987 "Grim Reaper" ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to raise AIDS awareness in Australia has been credited with successfully informing the public about the very real risks of the virus, and that transmission was not limited to gay men through its terrifying imagery. It backfired somewhat in that some interpreted the reapers in the commercial to symbolise gay men and not the AIDS virus, however.
<ul><li> On an even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">adult</a> level, an infamous French AIDS campaign showing a woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">having sex with a human-sized spider</a> (resp. man/scorpion).
</li></ul></li><li> Traffic safety films before the 1970s used to feature the gruesome results of actual car accidents and the people involved in them who were often horrifically injured and even <em>died</em> on camera. In the 1970s onward, this was replaced with slow motion footage of crash test dummies in collision tests; it drove home the point of how accidents happen without getting into the gore.
</li><li> Operation Lifesaver is this with railroad safety.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://dumbwaystodie.com/">Dumb Ways to Die<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> also turns out to be about railroad safety. Until they get around to that, though, it's mostly hilarious (and set to a fairly catchy song).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">Nuclear Weapons Taboo</a>. The entire popular culture from the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">The Great Politics Mess-Up</a> had been imbued with the sense of a nuclear apocalypse coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, enough to burn off the human species altogether and leave the cockroaches ruling the Earth. In practice, the hundreds of open air nuclear test detonations show the effects were not going to be <em>that</em> destructive. Which was the true danger from the start: people will think longer and maybe give up before launching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a>; while treating the nuke as just a very big bomb not inherently different than any other ordinance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">is tempting enough for those in power to use them</a>.
</li><li> The PARTY program in Canada is a form of this. High school students are taken to a hospital to see how the staff there try to save drunk driving victims. It's not pretty, and can involve police officers showing up to talk about drunk driving accidents.
</li><li> Healthy-eating videos don't skimp on showing how harmful unhealthy food can be to the body, from clogged arteries, to heart attacks, to damaged liver. Several older ones seem to ignore the idea of eating junkfood in moderation, either you eat all healthy (fruits, veggies, grains, etc.) or all junk (Burgers, fried foods, chips, cake). That unhealthy foods can be safely eaten if you eat them sparingly, with plenty of healthier foods in between, is rarely mentioned in older videos.
</li><li> The essay "And Sudden Death," which ran in Reader's Digest in 1935, offered an extremely graphic (even by modern standards) account of all the horrible things that can happen to you in a car accident. Near the beginning of the essay, the author suggests that "If ghosts could be put to a useful purpose, every bad stretch of road in the United States would greet the oncoming motorist with groans and screams and the educational spectacle of ten or a dozen corpses, all sizes, sexes and ages, lying horribly still on the bloody grass." It's pretty much downhill from there (although remembering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">cars in 1935 had very few safety features</a>  even seat belts were rare back then  can serve as mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant">Nightmare Retardant</a>).
</li><li> Animal rights activists also love this trope, with many of them showing footage from slaughterhouses, animal testing labs, and factory farms to win people over to the cause of vegetarianism and veganism.
</li><li> Your mind will often do this to itself, the term "l'appel du vide" means "The call of the void" and it's when your mind creates an intrusive, self-destructive, or life-threatening scenario in your head that either frightens or depresses you. This is done to keep you in control of your actions and prevent you from making a decision that affects your wellbeing or someone else's.
</li><li> Quite possibly the best (YMMV) known program in the USA and Canada is the D.A.R.E. program, a drug abuse education program that has the hilarious distinction of being completely ineffective and actually causing more kids and teens to try drugs as they learn about them through the program. Their main tactic is 'educating' students on the horrors of drug use. Every few years, after a new study comes out showing how totally useless the program is, they try to reinvent themselves, falling into the same tired "scare em straight' tactics with a new coat of paint on.
</li><li> Woodshop classes are required to do this, especially when teaching teenagers. Woodshop classes are a very dangerous place if the students refuse to listen to their instructors or mess with things they shouldn't be playing with in the first place.
<ul><li> A few junior high students in Nova Scotia wound up partially scalped or with severed fingers due to not paying attention to the machinery.
</li></ul></li><li> Vaccination is a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">pricky theme</a>. A study tested whether presenting scientific results (statistics, more numbers...) or invoking this trope (by telling some gruesome real cases) could convert an anti-vaxer. To the surprise of the researchers, both were equal in being completely ineffective.
