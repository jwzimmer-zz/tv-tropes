You can't really blame them for eventually running out of reasonable ones and going back to the family well. Also common in particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwy</a> and plot-heavy video games and long-running dramatic television series. Modern incarnations are often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a>, but not always. The presence of (fertile) immortals can easily lead to this, especially if the immortality is itself heritable.
</p><p>Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> when dealing with a feudal society. Those stories tend to revolve around royalty and nobility, who were intermarried so heavily that it's entirely plausible for every scheming duke and brave baron to be someone's uncle or cousin. This is possibly where the trope originates. Also true for humanity in general: recent studies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of <em>all</em> humans alive today may have lived as recently as three or four thousand years ago, while in most groups where immigration isn't the primary method of population growth, it is inevitable that this has happened much more recently. The way populations work, someone ends up either leaving a lot of descendants, or the family line dies out within a few generations. So if a person living now can trace their ancestry back to, say, Charlemagne, that means inevitably hundreds of thousands, and probably millions, of other people living today can do the same thing, which means they are all distant cousins. It is assumed some 30% of all Central Europeans descend from Charlemagne in one way or another.

Usually a pedigree of a foreparent either collapses within six generations, or surviving that, his or her genes will spread and multiply immensely, like those of Charlemagne.

Fuyuki is really Raphael, who a teacher and a lover of Mikael, who in turn is a part of Noelle, who as you know, is in love with Yuusuke. Mikael, Noelle and Silky are parts of one angel soul, which makes something akin to siblings. Eros, Muse and Dispell are Silky's toys, living because of her power. And there's Noelle's family where noone is really evenblood-related.</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the important characters are revealed to be a part of the same family line or have the same ancestors by Part II of the series. The most important is of course the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Uzumaki Clan is an offshoot of the Senju Clan, who in turn is a sister clan of the Uchiha Clan; both of them are descended from the children of the Sage of the Six Paths, the legendary founder of the ninja arts. This thus makes Naruto not only related to the Uchiha (and his best frenemy, Sasuke), but the First and Second Hokage as well.</span>
</li><li> Naruto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is not the only Uzumaki left: Nagato and Karin are also descended from the clan even if they don't carry the surname anymore. Also Tsunade, whose grandfather married Mito <em>Uzumaki</em> before settling down to create Konoha with Madara Uchiha. In fact, Mito was the first host of the Nine Tails, being chosen specifically because she's an Uzumaki, and actually lived long enough to personally meet with and give advice to her successor, Naruto's mother Kushina.</span>
</li><li> The final arc gives more uncovered relationships: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Sage, Hagoromo was one of the twin sons of Kaguya, the first person (actually a celestial alien) who was able to control chakra. He inherited his mother's Rinnegan, while his brother, Hamura, inherited her <em>Byakugan</em> which he passed down to his descendants, the <em>Hyuga Clan</em>. In short, Naruto is also distantly related to his eventual wife, Hinata.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The main protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is revealed to be related to many other characters that he have met before the reveal, though most of them are revealed only in the final arc.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Quincies and Wandenreich are all related to each other, because they carry the blood of the Great Emperor, Yhwach.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Why can't the Wandenreich hurt Ichigo? Because he's also a Quincy, and not just some random Quincy either. His mother, Masaki, is a first cousin of Ryuken Ishida, Uryu's father. Ichigo and Uryu are revealed to be second cousins hundreds of chapters after their initial meeting. And it's deliberate; their respective fathers <em>know</em> this, but they neglect to tell their sons.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Kurosaki" is Masaki's surname even before her marriage. Specifically, she didn't shed her surname when she married Isshin <em>Shiba</em> and gave birth to her children, Ichigo, Karin, and Yuzu. Are there other people who have the surname "Shiba"? Yeah. Needless to say, this takes Rukia and Byakuya's comments about Ichigo reminding them of Kaien to a different light.</span>
</li><li> All beaten by this particularly nice statement: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Yhwach is the son of the Soul King<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19m8e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19m8e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19m8e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the symbol and possibly ancestor of every souls in the universe</span></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>: A-yup.

The Amorphous pieces are actually shards of Mimi, so since Toto, Yuyu, and Nyunyu were created from the pieces, they're Cocona's artificial "siblings".</span> The only people completely unrelated to this family tree are Sayuri, Hidaka, and Bu-chan.

This comes after he admits that another of Poseidon's children (and thus one of Percy's half-siblings) is Krysomallos, the flying ram with golden fleece who saved Phrixus (and tried to save Helle) and in turn allowed Phrixus to skin him and sacrifice him to the gods, with his skin becoming the legendary Golden Fleece. Which means Percy is, as he puts it, "related to a sheepskin rug."

But there aren't really any cases of 'surprise-relatives' (which this trope seems to be about). Well, except perhaps Túrin getting told that his wife is actually his grown-up and amnesiac baby sister, but the reader knows that from the start. This is most apparent in the First Age, where all the main Elves and Men are descended from the three 'fathers' of their respective races (Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë/Elu Thingol for the Elves, and Bëor, Marach and Haldad for the Men), and there is much intermarriage between the descendents, which eventually leads to the birth of Elrond and Elros, who are descended from all of them simultaneously. This trope becomes less apparent in the Second and Third Ages, as the First Age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">thinned the cast a bit</a>.

<ul><li> Most of the wizarding families are related in one way or another, mostly for being a very small population and community, coupled in addition with pureblood inter-marrying of cousins.
</li><li> The Black Family Tree in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Book 5</a> reveals the extent of this trope among wizards. Most pureblood wizarding families in Great Britain are related through their connections to the House of Black:
<ul><li> The Bulstrode, Burke, Crabbe, Crouch, Flint, Gamp, Lestrange, Longbottom, Macmillan, Malfoy, Potter, Prewett, Rosier, Weasley, and Yaxley are the pure-blood families confirmed to have married into the House. Notice how many of them have been introduced to the readers beforehand. The Flint, in particular, had its member, Ursula, be one of the two latest common ancestors of all Black members and their descendants born after 1876. Marcus Flint, that shady Slytherin Quidditch captain during Harry's first three years, turns out to be related to almost everyone.
</li><li> Sirius is first cousin to the Black Sisters: Bellatrix married the Lestranges, Narcissa the Malfoys, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a> Andromeda married a Muggleborn, Ted Tonks. Narcissa is Draco's mother, while Andromeda is Tonks' mother.
</li><li> Both of Sirius' parents, Orion and Walburga, had the surname Black even before they married; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">they were second cousins</a>.
</li><li> The Weasley siblings (Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny) are third cousins of Sirius, Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa, as they share two great-great-grandparents: Phineas Nigellus Black (Hogwarts' least popular Headmaster) and Ursula Flint. By extension, this would make the Weasley siblings third cousins once removed of Draco and Tonks.
</li><li> Molly's uncle, Ignatius Prewett married Lucretia. Lucretia was not only Sirius' aunt, but also Arthur Weasley's second cousin.

Dumbledore was friends with Gellert Grindelwald, whose great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot, author of <em>History of Magic</em>, lived in Godric's Hollow. Bathilda herself was a neighbour of the Potters and often visited Harry when he was a baby. What's more, Godric's Hollow is not only Godric Gryffindor's birthplace (the village was named after him) but also the resting place of Ignotus Peverell, creator of the Invisibility Cloak. As the cloak is passed parent to child, it's likely that Ignotus' descendants never left the village throughout the centuries, despite their changing surname, up to Harry's time.
</li><li> As it turns out, Lily Potter was not only Snape's ex-best friend but also his childhood friend, having grown up with him in Spinner's End. Aunt Petunia also knows Snape; he is the "awful boy" she describes in Book 5, not James, as the fanbase assumed.
</li><li> Harry is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, one of the three Peverell brothers who received the Deathly Hallows. Another Peverell brother is a distant ancestor of Tom Riddle/Voldemort, which means that Harry and Voldemort are themselves cousins, several times removed.

This is generally interpreted as Wolfram telling his readers that all of mankind is one big family, even across national and religious divides - Parzival has an elder half-brother, Feirefis, who is a Muslim (although at the end of the story he becomes a Christian) and has black-and-white piebald skin, being the son of a white father and a black mother. For the time of the Crusades, when it was written, this was a quite unusual message of tolerance.

<ul><li> Sol (back in the days when he still went by the name of Frederick) was Aria's lover, Aria being heavily implied as Justice's true identity before she was converted into a Commander Gear (further supported by Valentine, a clone of Aria introduced in <em>GG2: Overture</em>, and finally confirmed in <em>Xrd -REVELATOR-</em>). Dizzy is Justice's daughter and, if <em>Accent Core Plus</em> and <em>Overture</em> are any indication, she eventually marries Ky. They have a son named Sin. If you subscribe to the theory that Sol is Dizzy's father (which is suggested at multiple points throughout the series, especially in <em>-REVELATOR-</em>), Sin is essentially all of the main characters rolled into one.
</li><li> Furthermore, the Valentine seen in <em>Overture</em> turns out to be the first of several Valentines, who begin showing up in the <em>Xrd</em> installments.

If you have multiple vassals from the same clan you only need one marriage to satisfy all of them, luckily.

<ul><li> Common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland">Iceland</a>, which has a small, almost completely genetically homogeneous population that has lived in geographic isolation for over a millennium. It's not unheard of to start dating an erstwhile complete stranger, and then encounter them at a reunion of extended family. This high level of national endogamy makes Iceland very interesting to genetic researchers. It's gotten to the point where there's actually an app in Iceland that allows people to check if they're closely related before they start dating.
</li><li> Common also in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Finland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Finland">Finland</a>, which has been a genetic isolate for a millennium. It is not uncommon for people sharing the same surname but assuming they are not related to each other, to find out they are ninth or tenth cousins.

</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a> has this, to the point where very rare genetical diseases such as Xeroderma Pigmentosum are between 10 and up to 1000 times more likely to be among Japanese. The thing that a lot of Japanese culture revolves around a strong sense of "us and them" is but one reason why Japanese don't exactly marry outsiders that often.
</li><li> The Cohen haplotype. All male Jews who belong in the Kohanim (the priestly class) share <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron">a common ancestor who lived some 3,200 years ago in the Near East.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> knows him by the name of Aaron. The Kohanim are in theory only the male-line descendants of Aaron. A recent genetic study indicates that 50% of all Cohens have the same Y Chromosome—and the Y chromosome is preserved from father to son generation after generation. If the rule had been perfectly followed, we would expect 100%, but over 3200 years we expect there to be some accidents (some lying about being Kohanim, unfaithful spouses, perhaps adoption), so a 50% rate is surprisingly high.
</li><li> The human species as a whole has relatively little genetic variation, as the result of a "bottleneck" where the population decreased to very low numbers about 70,000 years ago. In fact, all living humans are descended from "Adam" who lived about 60,000 to 90,000 years ago, meaning that we are all related, albeit distantly in most cases. In fact, all individuals of all species on Earth, from bacteria to sequoias to fruit flies to humans, is related through the Latest Common Ancestor
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korea</a> has about the longest table of affinities in the world; it also has about the most complete genealogical database in the world. Also, one of the requirements for a marriage license is that both partners must do a genealogical search to be sure that they aren't too closely related. It is not uncommon for couples to be surprised. It used to be <em>worse</em>; it took a Korean Supreme Court decision to change it. Couples were living in unwedded bliss because they could not legally be married.
</li><li> In the year 2012, a California student named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyAmericansHaveWackyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyAmericansHaveWackyNames">Bridge Anne</a> D'Avignon completed a genealogical project that, by tracing both paternal and maternal lines, proved that forty-two of the forty-three men to become president of the United States of America are descended from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland">King John of England</a>. The only exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinVanBuren">Martin Van Buren</a>.
</li><li> The royal families of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> were all related to each other. Because Queen Victoria and Prince Albert married their children into many different monarchies (and their grandchildren later married into other monarchies as well), their descendants included: the King of England, the Kaiser of Germany, the Tsarina of Russia, the Queen of Greece, the Queen of Norway, the Crown Princess of Sweden, the Queen of Spain, and the Queen of Romania. The Norwegian throne was created in 1905, and a Danish prince was chosen to be King, so they were related to the Danish royal family as well. The rulers of Austria-Hungary were related to the Spanish rulers: Francis II was the child of a Spanish princess, and Franz Joseph I of Austria (Franz Ferdinand's father) was the grandson of Francis II. Austria-Hungary was also related to Italy: Franz Joseph was from the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, and so was Maria Theresa of Austria, who was the great-grandmother of Victor Emmanuel III. The King of Serbia was married to Princess Zorka of Montenegro, whose sister married Victor Emmanuel III, connecting Serbia to the family as well. Franz Joseph married Empress Elizabeth of Austria, whose niece married Albert I of Belgium (in addition, her grandfather was an exiled king of Portugal). Ferdinand I of Romania was the son of a Portuguese princess, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Ferdinand I of Bulgaria</a> was from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the same as King George V of England. Even the minor countries where involved: the de facto Albanian king was descended from Romanian and Dutch royalty, and the reigning Grand Duchess of Luxembourg was, again, descended from the Portuguese monarchy. The mother of the King of Montenegro was the aunt of a woman who married an Italian prince. For Liechtenstein, the Ruling Prince's sister married Arnulf of Bavaria, whose uncle was King Otto of Greece (and Otto's grandson was the King who married one of Victoria's grandchildren); Arnulf of Bavaria was also the Stewart Pretender to the British throne. Aside from the obvious exceptions (either not part of Europe or with no monarchy), the Ottoman Empire <em>may</em> be the only exception: there is a claim that they were related to the Habsburgs through the Byzantine Empire , and despite the fact that the Ottoman Sultans preferred to marry normal women rather than foreign princesses, a legend states that one spouse was related to Napoleon, whose wife was from the House of Habsburg. World War I could be described as the nastiest family quarrel ever.
<ul><li> The Spanish Habsburg line itself was this in spades, given their penchant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">cousins marrying each other</a> and uncles marrying nieces, occasionally interbreeding with the Austrian Habsburgs. This finally culminated in Carlos II, last of the line. There had been so much inbreeding in the family over generations that his parents (already blood uncle and niece) produced a child that was more genetically homozygous than that of a child born of two siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> This is not an uncommon phenomenon in small towns and villages, especially in rural areas. Aside from the occasional blow-in, most residents will generally be related by marriage, at least.
</li><li> The island of Tristan da Cunha is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha">the most remote inhabited community in the world<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, located over 2000 km from, well, anywhere else (nearest neighbours are South Africa and St. Helena). There is a present-day population of 297 residents, who all carry one of the eight last names of the original eight men and seven women who first settled on the island through the 19th and early 20th century. That is, the entire population of the island is thought to be descended from 15 people (though it seems every now and then someone would go abroad and pick up a wife or husband while away, it is actually illegal to immigrate to the island, meaning little genetic variance in the immediate future).
