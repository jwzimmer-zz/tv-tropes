</p><p>This is normally the result of budget considerations when casting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> stories, the consequence of having a long-term contract for a star when a show permanently jumps generations for some reason, or an excuse to do an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworld</a> story with essentially the same character in a different setting.

</p><p>Despite the name, the trope is limited to neither males nor grandchildren.
</p><p>This trope gets somewhat disturbing if you over-think it. Having one's grandparents look <em>exactly</em> like their grandchild and said grandchild's mate has pseudo-incestuous imagery.

</li><li>Both.

<ul><li> The rise in popularity of wood-burning stoves in the 1970s led to a demand for chimney sweeps. One enterprising young man in (town redacted) went to a tourist trap to have a sepia-toned photograph taken of himself dressed in 19th-century clothing and holding his chimney sweeping tools, and featured the picture with the caption "Our Founder" in his ads.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</a></em>, Mireille looks suspiciously similar to Mistral. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is justified, though; the story takes place on the internet and she's using her (revealed to be) mother's account.</span> In any case, it's established that player characters in the .hack franchise are all based on off-the-peg character types. There's a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em> where Subaru sees someone she thinks is Tsukasa but is actually a different character with only a few variations of hair color and facial markings. This is also lampshaded in <em>.hack//Unison</em>, where Black Rose and Mimiru have an argument as to who chose the character design first, and Tsukasa meets a younger player with the same basic design. <em>.hack//Legend of the Twilight [Bracelet]</em> begins with Shugo and Rena winning the right to use characters based on Kite and Black Rose (apparently those exact combinations of character customizations were locked by the admins after Kite and Black Rose's adventure, though to be fair Kite's was originally green without Wave marks, changing to his well-known form upon getting the bracelet and thus possible its not normally selectable anyways; additionally, the series uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">chibi</a> versions of the characters).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>: Though she's only seen in the New Year's episode, Kaorin's mother looks exactly like her. She has to wake Kaorin to remind her she was supposed to be going out with her classmates to make her wish for the new year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>'s Huey Laforet appears to have the strongest genes ever, as his traits of being a gold-eyed, dark-haired, pale-skinned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">pretty boy</a> extend even as far as his <em>great-great</em>-grandson Charon.
<ul><li> Another one of the immortals (namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Szilard</span>) has an identical many-greats grandson whom we meet in 2001.
</li><li> Claudia looks like a female version of her great-grandfather <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Claire</span> But she <em>still</em> inherited her great-great-grandfather Huey's golden eyes.
</li><li> Both Elmer and Aging note that Luchino, while not quite the clone of Huey that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">Chane, Liza, and Charon are</a>, still has a noticeable resemblance to him. This would not seem so ridiculous if Luchino wasn't <em>three hundred years removed</em> from the man in question (an absurdity lampshaded by Luchino himself), proving once and for all that Huey has the most stubborn genes in the world.
</li></ul></li><li> Shura Kirigakure from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em> looks identical to her ancestor Tatsuko. This is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tatsuko's descendants are cursed to look just like her.</span>
</li><li> It's a minor plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> that Daikichi looks exactly like his grandfather Souichi did at age thirty. Among other things, this causes Rin (Souichi's illegitimate daughter) to get attached to him almost immediately.
</li><li> Every male member of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a></em>'s family line is named "Phantom F. Harlock," has the same facial features, build and hairstyle, pilots some kind of aircraft, and frequently has an identical scar on his cheek. This has been shown to extend at least back to the World War I era (from a main series set in the far future). His short, squat sidekick Ooyama also has identical ancestors, although they don't crop up quite as often. <em>Gun Frontier</em> had an ancestor named "Westerner Franklin Harlock" who also looked identical to the Harlock in the future stories. They are also voiced by the same English voice actor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em>, the Kisugi sisters looks a lot like their ancestors: Rui (the oldest) and Ai (the youngest) are nearly identical to their mother (especially Rui, whose only difference is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark">mole on the cheek</a>), while Hitomi is almost identical to her paternal grandmother, differing only in her hair and eye colors. Hitomi is especially egregious, as she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">half-Japanese half-German</a> while her grandmother was a blonde-haired green-eyed German.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, the series protagonist, Tanjiros, ancestor from a few generations ago, Sumiyoshi, looks exactly like him but only taller, as he was shown as an older man with wife and child, due seemly being in good health; meanwhile Tanjiros immediate relative, his father Tanjuro, looks just slightly different due his ill underweight appearance.
</li><li> With the exception of the fact that she has an extra pair of human ears under her hair, Couvert of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays">Dog Days</a></em> is the spitting image of Princess Clarifier. The confusing part is the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they aren't even directly related since Clarifier died before having any children. Couvert is actually a descendant of Clarifier's brother Valério and Adelaide.</span> During Valério and Adelaide's story about Flonyard's history, we see that most of the other major characters were like this as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> has a severe case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">Strong Family Resemblance</a> syndrome, which dictates that within a family or lineage (be it immediate or extended), everyone looks alike (even wives and husbands). Nobita's grandson wants to change his grandfather's loser's faith and sends Doraemon back in time to help him become a better man. At one time he also sends Doraemon's little sister Dorami to replace Doraemon because he thinks Doraemon isn't doing a good job, but because Nobita's grown attached to Doraemon so they're still together.
</li><li> Somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the side story of the 20th volume of <em>Dorabase</em> (Baseball spin-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>), where the 23rd-century versions of the characters are exactly the same, except for some very minor differences such as name and a few physical traits. Also, they suck at baseball until the main characters come to help them. Obviously justified since 60% of the cast are robots, but still pretty outrageous because they are about 100 years old apart from production year. Also, in the end, it is very much implied that this trope will go on until the next (24th) century. This means that the main teams would still exist for the next 200 years or so.
</li><li> Son Goten of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> is a particularly egregious example. He's the second child of Goku and looks 'exactly' like him. This, in turn, makes him looks like his parental grandfather, Bardock. It might be a Saiyan thing, since Vegeta said that "all Saiyans look similar", which could because of a small gene pool given that Saiyans at their peak only numbered in the thousands (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> further posited that "low class" Saiyans like Goku were bred from similar genetic stock, and Goku gained an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Stranger</a> named Turles). Vegeta looks nearly identical to his own father, sans beard. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> takes it to a ridiculous level, with the future descendants of both Goku and Vegeta looking like exact copies of their great-great-etc. ancestors. Even though they'd be mostly human, and it was already established with Vegeta's son and daughter that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">human-Saiyan hybrids</a> need not look Saiyan-like at all. Then again, his daughter looks exactly like her human mother. With that said, Goten's personality, as with Goku's are different to Bardock's. Similarly, Goku Jr. was very different known his namesake, at least at first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove">From Eroica with Love</a></em>'s Dorian and Klaus look exactly like their ancestors, Luminous and Tyrian.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles">Evillious Chronicles</a> has multiple examples that come up as plot points (or even not) —such as several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremSeeker">Duke Venomania's</a> descendants sharing his appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfTheFather">to their misfortune</a>, or the Marlon family having a lot of men with blue hair and similar haircuts. From a meta perspective, this is because most of the main characters in each arc are portrayed by the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a> as their ancestor in the last one.
</li><li> Laxus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> looks like a younger Makarov, except much taller and more muscular. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Hades</a>, who was Precht Gaebolg and the man who appointed Makarov to the title of guildmaster back in the day, actually double-takes when Laxus crashes the party and calls him "boy", which he used to call Makarov, while an image of a younger Makarov is superimposed on him.

This line is marked by white hair, blue eyes, and bizarre supernatural talents. So in fact, <em>all</em> of Storm's ancestors look alike, and this is justified as a supernatural trait.

It's worth noting that the designers attempted a partial subversion by making the grandfather's Klingon forehead ridges less pronounced than Worf's and his hair thinner, which more realistically account for changes in the family gene pool over two generations. Worf and his brother, Kurn (played by Tony Todd), share the same ridges.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> films fall into this trope; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">original movie</a>, all of the T-800 model Terminators looked (and even <em>smelled</em>) like different people, in order to infiltrate human bunkers (and get past sentry-dogs); but in the sequels, somehow <em>all</em> of the T-800 Terminators look like Arnold — despite that this defeats the entire <em>premise</em> of organic cyborg-Terminators, since the humans would only need to watch out for anyone who looks like Arnold. (The original movie even showed this; the T-800 Terminator shown in the original flashback-scene was played by bodybuilder Franco Columbu). The best way to explain this is that all T-800s are the same basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeleBot9000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkeleBot9000">endoskeleton</a>, while the model numbers (Arnold's Terminator identifies himself as model 101) refer to the external appearance.

This explains Franco Columbu, who has the same basic endo-skeleton but is essentially a different sub-model. This is explicitly described at the beginning of the novelization for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>, where future John Connors looks for the right model of T-800 to send into the past.

It is implied that Lav is an ancestor of Rincewind's (and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">Dog Latin</a> it is revealed that Lavaeolus means "rinser of winds").

</li><li> Used as the basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>'s story "Double Indemnity": a man time-travels to the past to find his ancestor, since said ancestor looks almost exactly like him, which would allow him to pose as the man's time-travel mishap-born clone (for sake of an insurance scam). Apparently, the man's criteria for choosing the right ancestor was simply "someone who would not be missed", and the only reason he rejects several candidates is because they happen to have acquired differences (missing an arm, covered with pox) — implying that every single one of his ancestors is identical.

Erlik and Liza had a son and a daughter, whose DNA they modified so they weren't genetically related, allowing the children to continue the line. Apparently, the fact that they still had the same parents and were raised as brother and sister didn't create any issues. This continued until the birth of André St. Ivo, whose intelligence was far below normal. Realizing a fresh "infusion" of blood was necessary to keep the family (and the business) going, André's parents didn't have a second child, forcing him to look for a bride on other worlds. André ended up marrying Theia Mitchell, who wound up effectively running Galactic Cybersystems and gave birth to two healthy sons: Aramant (who looked exactly like André) and John. André, jealous of Theia, has her shot and then her almost-dead body turned into a bio-doll for his pleasure. Meanwhile, Aramant is groomed as André's successor, while John grows up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a>.

Thanks to his resemblance to his father, he is killed by Theia who manages to break her mental conditioning who doesn't know how much time has passed. John ends up mortally wounded by André's robots and has his mind copied onto an android, who was modeled on Erlik St. Ivo. Given that John looks like Erlik, this turns out to be a happy coincidence.

Up to Durin VII are recorded as Kings of Durin's Folk, it's unclear if this practice is maintained outside of the direct line of succession.

Catherine, on the other hand, expects Henry and Eleanor's mother's portrait to look very like one or the other of them, from reading novels in which a portrait looks as much like the child as the mother, and finds it not very close at all.

So of course when the main characters went back to 1931 and met their grandfather Ernest Keonig, he too was played by Oswalt.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo">'Allo 'Allo!</a></em>, Gordon Kaye not only played Rene under aging makeup, but also his son. Gets even funnier when we learn the son was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstepBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstepBaby">Doorstep Baby</a>, and it's not entirely clear (at least to Rene's wife) why his mother chose to leave him on their doorstep in particular...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> (a.k.a. "Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda"). The Nietzscheans as a race are descendants of humans from Earth, but their founder took his followers (about 8000 individuals, so not a particularly large group) into space, and later reduced their genetic variety by stripping out genes he considered "useless", such as predispositions for obesity, diabetes, haemophilia and various cancers. One of the core tenets of early Nietzschean philosophy was using eugenics (planned breeding) and genetic manipulation to create the "perfect ubermensch" (hence the name). Given that the original gene pool was so small, that Nietzscheans breed for a rather small number of traits, that Nietzcheans at the time of the series number in the trillions, and that there are only so many viable ways for genes to recombine, it is rare, but in no way unheard of, for Nietzscheans not obviously related to be born with identical genetic codes. The Nietzscheans call it "Genetic Reincarnation", and a particular plot revolves around the genetic reincarnation of the progenitor of their race.
<ul><li> In-series, Genetic Reincarnation appears twice: Steve Bacic plays the Nietzschean Gaheris Rhade and his identical-looking direct descendant, Telemachus Rhade, who lives 300 years later and the reincarnation of the progenitor Drago Museveni does show up at one point and is, in fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyr's son</span>. We only see him as a child, but he is dark-skinned compared to the original Drago Museveni, played by Lochlyn Munro.
</li></ul></li><li> Both played straight and averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em> shows.
<ul><li> Every series featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> as the various generations of Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as his servant Baldrick. However, other actors, in particular Tim McInnery, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, and Miranda Richardson appeared in regular or guest roles in three or four of the series, but playing characters who were not necessarily related and sometimes had very different personalities.
</li><li> For example, McInnery played Lord Percy in the first two series but left because he considered the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a>" character too limited - he reappeared in a guest role in the third series as an apparent Upper-Class Twit who was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a>, and returned as a regular in the fourth series with a completely different personality, while Hugh Laurie took over the Upper-Class Twit role in the third and fourth series.
</li><li> Melchett on the other hand is played by Stephen Fry in various incarnations which include being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">one of the only sane men</a> in the second season to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral">an incompetent general</a> in the fourth whose greatest strategy is to have his troops climb out of the trenches and walk very slowly toward the enemy. Then in <em>Blackadder: Back and Forth</em> his modern incarnation is fairly sane but we also see him as a crazy Roman general.
</li><li> In fact, in <em>Blackadder: Back and Forth</em> Blackadder even says that the time machine appears to be following their DNA through time.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the finale of the third series, when Blackadder and MacAdder are both played by Rowan Atkinson. Several characters note this. They also make it plain that they are played by the same actor, as they keep just missing each other.
</li><li> Also in one episode of season three, Vincent Hanna (a BBC reporter known for doing election coverage) actually guest starred as his own ancestor—who is reporting on the election through an open window to a crowd outside as one would on television.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackHoleHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackHoleHigh">Black Hole High</a></em>, Principal Durst has an identical great-grandmother who was headmistress of the future Blake Holsey High at the time it opened. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Avenir, chairman of the school's board of directors claims to be the great-grandson of identical Avenir who financed the school's construction, though it's all but stated outright that Avenir, being a time traveler, is actually the same man.

</li><li> Another borderline case: Jan once found a picture of her great-aunt when the great-aunt was Jan's age, and it looked just like Jan (Eve Plumb in the Identical Great-Niece role). Jan wanted to meet the great-aunt to see what she (Jan) would look like when she grew up. The great-aunt was played by Imogene Cocoa. Jan was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">somewhat less than plussed</a>.

Piper's boyfriend Dan and future husband Leo also have past lives in that period, Dan's being the sisters' great-grandfather. <em>Charmed</em> explains the resemblance as "souls recognizing each other" implying that they may in fact have actually looked very different. (No such explanation was provided when the sisters time-traveled to the 1970s and happened to meet the father of one of the show's recurring characters, who was identical to his future adult son except for the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">Funny Afro</a>.)

This became widely known to the show's characters after a collection of letters between Santo and Colleen was discovered. Oddly, after a letter was uncovered stating that EJ was not really Stefano's son, nobody seemed to recall the fact that EJ looks identical to Stefano's father. (That letter was eventually found to be a forgery, and Stefano really is EJ's father.)

In particular, Sheridan, Luis, and Antonio were revealed to have lived out many past lives together, as were Miguel and Charity. In one case, the Pilgrim-era Prudence Standish was originally depicted as a past life of protagonist Charity Standish; however, after Charity was written out of the show and her rival Kay completed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Prudence was later depicted as a past life of Kay and switched to being played by the other actress.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> franchise has been very fond of this one. The episode "Wild West Rangers" showed that five of the main characters (and at least one minor character) had identical ancestors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> (despite the implication that several of the characters were first-generation Americans).

Condsidering the amount of magic that was thrown around in the first 3 seasons (as well as the cause of them traveling back), it could be said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>.
<ul><li> During season 9, Jason Faunt played both red ranger Wes Collins and Alex, who was both his descendant and his professional predecessor a thousand years in the future.

<ul><li> It also featured a flashback in which DJ's actor plays a child version of Roseanne—his mom
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> episode "Normandy", Helen Magnus recalls her part in the D-Day invasion during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. During their mission in Carentan, France, they are aided by American troops, headed by Captain Jack Zimmerman, who looks exactly like Will Zimmerman, Helen's second-in-command, and is played by the same actor. While Captain Zimmerman is killed at the end of the episode, it is implied that he is Will's grandfather. Interestingly, Helen makes no mention of this to Will, even though this could be one of the reasons she chose him to join the Sanctuary (i.e. his grandfather saved her life at the cost of his own).
</li><li> The archetypal identical grandson appeared on the 1960s sitcom <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecondHundredYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecondHundredYears">The Second Hundred Years</a></em>, where Monte Markham played both a 33-year-old man named Ken Carpenter and his grandfather Luke, who had improbably been pulled out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">suspended animation</a> after 67 years in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">glacial crevasse</a> into which he'd fallen while prospecting at the age of (ta-dum) 33. The joke was first, that effectively 33-year-old Luke had a 67-year-old son, Ken's father; and second, that while Luke and Ken looked identical, they had completely different personalities, Ken being uptight and Luke loose and colorful.

</li></ul></li><li> The episode, "How The Station Got Its Name" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em> features the children and Mr. Conductor traveling back in time and meeting the grandparents of the people who run the station in their present. Unsurprisingly, the station's former staff are played by the same actors who play their grandchildren, and thus all look identical to said grandchildren. Even the Jukebox Band's grandparents look identical, though they work in a pedal piano instead of a jukebox.
</li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SimonAndSimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SimonAndSimon">Simon &amp; Simon</a></em> involving an inheritance and Simon family history, we meet several generations of Simon brothers, played by the same actors playing the title heroes.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> episode "Relic", we see Clark's real father, Jor-El, and Lana's great aunt, Louise McCallum, both played by Lana and Clark's actors. (Lionel Luthor's father and Jonathan Kent's father also appeared, but surprisingly Lachlan Luthor was played by John Mann instead of John Glover and Hiram Kent was played by Dean Wray instead of John Schneider.) Especially interesting because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> when Jor-El comes to Smallville (in the 9th season) and he is acted by Julian Sands who looks nothing like Tom Welling to the point of having different hair colors.

<ul><li> A ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek</a> novel specifically states the Worf was named after his grandfather, who was killed onboard a transport that collided with a Cardassian freighter (the sheer improbability of two ships accidentally colliding in orbit indicates sabotage). So yes, Worf's grandfather didn't die a warrior's death but was merely collateral damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em>Star Trek Generations</em> includes a portrait of one of Jean-Luc Picard's ancestors, who fought at Trafalgar. He looks exactly like Patrick Stewart.

What's hilarious is that Seven of Nine is puzzled by Janeway's interest in O'Donnell's life, pointing out that after so many generations Janeway only has a fraction of her DNA. Hah!
<ul><li> Even more hilarious since humans share something like 99% of the same DNA, which means that Janeway's "fraction" of O'Donnell's DNA is much bigger than 7 seems to think.
</li></ul></li><li> A three-part story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> featured Dr Arik Soong, played by Brent Spiner, who had played Dr Noonien Soong (and all the androids Noonien modelled on himself, including Commander Data as well as Data's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> Lore and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">undeveloped</a> twin B4.) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. This has lead to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fanwanky</a> theories about Arik Soong actually being the same person as Noonien Soong, thanks to a rejuvenating planet Arik was in the neighborhood of once.
<ul><li> The source of said fankwankery seems to be a throwaway line by Arik Soong at the end of his three-episode arc, about giving up on genetic engineering (which in his time is illegal) in favor of creating androids. The writers no doubt intended for the implication to be that he would be unable to complete the designs in his own lifetime, and that his descendant later finished his work.
</li><li> Other theories postulate that given Arik's expertise in genetic engineering, Noonien and all the generations between them were straight up clones.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Enterprise</em> story "Carbon Creek" features T'Pol's great-grandmother T'Mir, also played by Jolene Blalock. T'Mir's story is told by T'Pol and may or may not be true, but as to whether T'Pol really had a great-grandmother named T'Mir who really did look like T'Pol... well, that's another story. The episode ends with T'Pol taking out a purse from a box, which looks identical to the one her great-grandmother supposedly had on Earth. Vulcan women don't generally carry purses.

Oddly enough, her <em>sister</em> Ishara Yar is not.
</li><li> Also from the <em>Next Generation</em> episode "The Neutral Zone", Claire Raymond, who was woken up from cryogenic stasis after 370 years, finds that she has a great-great-great-great-great-grandson who looks identical to her husband Donald.

He said that the <em>Modern Warfare</em> Price is intended to be the grandson of the World War II Captain Price.

<ul><li> Although similar, Link and Zelda don't exactly look identical in each game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em> has Linebeck III as a literal example, who looks exactly like his grandad from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em>. Zelda herself lacks the strong tan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Odango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Odango">Odango-esque</a> hairstyle of her great-great-grandmother (though they do look the same when dressed up). Link looks the same, although we don't exactly know if he's actually related to <em>Wind Waker</em> Link. In fact, a lot of characters in Spirit Tracks bear resemblance to their potential ancestors from <em>Phantom Hourglass</em> and <em>Wind Waker</em>.
</li><li> In <em>The Wind Waker</em>, Hyrule Castle has a portrait of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.zeldawiki.org/images/3/32/Portrait.jpg">Princess Zelda with her retainers.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> You might find that these pira—er, <em>retainers</em> look a bit familiar to Tetra's crew. Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule also has a suspiciously similar-looking ancestor by the name of Daltus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Minish Cap</a></em> (who himself has an identical ancestor named Gustaf).

This is a somewhat interesting case, as the next appearances of these likenesses occur many hundreds of years after this game, meaning either their family lines managed to keep their heads down for all that time or that it's not just Link and Zelda who get reincarnated.

The two of them look identical (right down to their girth), have the same name (it's apparently a family tradition now), run the exact same store (which looks almost completely unchanged from the first game) and even wear the exact same clothes and glasses. Did we mention that <em>Eternal Blue</em> is set <em>over 1000 years after the events of the original game?</em> A downplayed example would be Lemina, whom from the waist up looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of her ancestor Mia.
</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series with Big Boss and his three clone sons. Solid Snake and Liquid Snake in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> are mirror images of each other, but with different skin tones and hairstyles, while Solidus Snake in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, who has the same face as Solid Snake, is said to resemble the elder Big Boss from the early <em>Metal Gear</em> games. In contrast, Naked Snake, the young Big Boss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, resembles the young Solid Snake from the <em>MGS</em> titles.

In-game dialogue from Timmy suggests that Nicky is supposed to resemble Tootie (which she, sure enough, does when she appears on the show) but the graphics depict her as looking like De-aged Vicky from the "Switch Glitch" episode.
</li><li> There's also "Channel Chasers," which shows Tommy Turner who looks like his father with black hair (cluing the audience to believe Trixie or Tootie is his mother).

</li><li> In a later episode it is revealed that Peter's biological father is actually a man named Mickey McFinnigan, who looks very similar to Peter. This also means that the identical-looking Griffin ancestors were not actually related to him at all. At least not officially, there's nothing preventing one of them from stopping by Ireland

According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the episode was not a dream. Additionally, after they come out of the dream (and regardless of its actual status) Kim and Ron are confronted by a statue of someone who looks exactly like Ron from Ancient Rome and learns of his ancient nemesis and mysterious female ally who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dr. Drakken and Kim.

It turns out, though, that Mabel divorced Hiram and married escaped slave Virgil (who took Mabel's last name), which means that Homer and the kids have an ancestor who's identical to <em>Marge.</em> On the other hand, the trope is played straight with their son Abraham, who looks exactly like a slightly darker-complexioned Bart.

Minnie Pearl, an old friend of Hank Williams, remarked upon first meeting his grandson, "Lord, honey, you're a ghost."
</li><li> New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau had a daughter named Marie Laveau who was also a New Orleans Voodoo Queen who reportedly looked quite like her mother. Needless to say historical accounts and legends surrounding the two women often get mixed up.
</li><li> Dirk Blocker also looked almost exactly like his father, Dan.
</li><li> Alan Hale Sr. and Jr. looked a lot alike.
</li><li> See if you can find an old picture of Cal Ripken, Senior. The resemblance is almost <em>eerie</em>.
</li><li> Due to the tradition of always marrying their sisters, the Egyptian Pharaohs reportedly all looked almost identical. At least until those nasty recessive genes started making their heads look like American footballs.
</li><li> Speaking of American Football, compare <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nosaintshistory.com/images/highlights/archie-manning-of-ol-miss.jpg">Archie Manning<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in his playing days to the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Peyton-Manning.jpg">two of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://media.nj.com/giants_impact/photo/9138870-large.jpg">his sons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> that play the sport professionally.
</li><li> In one documentary of Joni Mitchell, clips from interviews with her starting decades ago are mixed in with the images, and it's very clear how her voice changed from when she was young to the modern day. Then, at the end, Mitchell meets back up with her genetic daughter she had put up for adoption—and her daughter's voice sounds just like hers from when she was young. (They do look different, though.)
</li><li> Dark complexion aside, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama's</a> basically the spitting image of his maternal grandfather.

<ul><li> In fact, all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' children look very much like their fathers.
<ul><li> In Julian Lennon's case, he even <em>sounds</em> like his father when singing. His half-brother Sean uncannily resembles their father in the 1970s with his long hair, beard and eyeglasses. When he made a splash with his own music in the 1980s, there was some momentary fan wishing that he could substitute for his father for the Beatles to reunite, but the alumni of that band shot that notion down instantly saying that is completely unfair to Julian.
</li><li> Except Zak Starkey, who seems to take more after his mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Three of the Beatles (John, Paul and George) themselves resembled each of their fathers. It's unknown if Ringo did because no picture of his father is available to the public.
</li><li> Giles Martin also bears an uncanny resemblance to his father, Beatles producer Sir George Martin.
</li></ul></li><li> There's the adage, "If you want to know what a woman will look like in a few decades, meet her mother." Generally, it's pretty accurate.
</li><li> The British Royal Family may in fact be made of this trope. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1222921/The-throne-clones-How-Royal-Family-inherited-just-titles.html">Behold!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> While that picture of Edward I being compared to Prince William is clearly an 18th—or 19th-century rendition (he lived in the 13th century), many of the other, more recent ancestral pictures on the page play it straight.
