</p><p>This is when a character tries to bribe somebody, but the bribe is either pathetically small or involves something of no conceivable value to the recipient. Common reactions include an incredulous stare, dismissive laughter, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire">arresting them for attempted bribery</a>. Alternatively, the recipient may enthusiastically accept the bribe, much to the amusement of the audience. (A once-common form of this variant involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canadians being bribed in American currency</a>, although economics can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">largely ruin any humor it holds</a>.)
</p><p>Common variations are:
</p><ul><li> Attempting to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a> money or a minor coupon in place of real cash.
</li><li> Doubling the payment of voluntary or forced labour, and when they refuse on the grounds that double of nothing is still nothing, the briber offers to triple the payment.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Bribing people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">something they have in a great abundance</a>, like offering a rock monster a rock you just found on the ground. Or something that isn't valuable or isn't even useful to their culture or situation, i.e. anything they'll call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>.
</li></ul><p>Sometimes gets inverted; the initial bribe is very large, at least by the standards of the person offering it. The other character refuses it but accepts something comparatively worthless instead, maybe even making the reduced counter-offer themselves. This is more likely to be a dramatic example than the normal way around— typically because the person taking the "bribe" has reasons of their own to do what's asked of them, but want to make a statement of some sort with the token payment. A specific example common in the real world is taking a single dollar (or local equivalent) as payment for services rendered; this is done because both sides have to give <strong>something</strong> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration">in order for a legal contract to exist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Such an absurdly small payment is referred to in legal parlance as a <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppercorn_%28legal%29">peppercorn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, after the rent paid yearly by the Freemasons of Bermuda for their meeting hall: a single grain of black pepper.

Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>, where the characters treat something as being less valuable than it is, rather than more valuable. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">Not Rare Over There</a>, where something is valuable to someone, but only because they need it and can't find it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallDemand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallDemand">Comically Small Demand</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldHisSoulForADonut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldHisSoulForADonut">Sold His Soul for a Donut</a>, where someone sells their soul for something comically insignificant.

<ul><li> Played straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> where Master Roshi attempts to buy one of the Dragon Balls from a gang of thieves.

Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">Facepalm</a> from Tien, Chiaotzu, and the bandits.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, Gintoki often tries to get people to do things by promising to give them 300 yen, which is about $2.50 USD.
</li><li> In the bonus chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> included in the "How To Read" book, the Shinigami King has reversed the "no new Death Notes" rule he put into place in reaction to Ryuk's shenanigans. Now, he'll give them out for two apples from Earth. Even beyond the fact that apples aren't exactly expensive or uncommon, shinigami are invisible and able to become intangible at will; it'd be trivially easy for any of them to just steal any number of apples.

However, when Soma makes an off-hand remark that someone in the dorm has all of the volumes of a shojo manga she's reading, she agrees to taste his food if he lends her the remaining volumes, since she doesnt know where to get them by herself.

Since the value of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillSpendCreditsInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillSpendCreditsInTheFuture">credits</a> is a bit inconsistent, we can only assume that he was expecting more.

The rebels decide to offer a reward for the Nome King's capture and/or assassination but they have no money or treasure. Instead decide to use this as a way to humiliate the Nome King and offer <em>two lollipops</em> as the entire reward. They then plaster Wanted posters to that effect all over the kingdom. The Nome King's overreaction to this insult brings on his downfall.

You've earned it!
</div></li><li> It's somewhat of a running gag, since he only pays Peter 10 cents a hole to caddy his golf clubs.
</li><li> Peter himself is similarly oblivious to an appropriate tip. In one strip, Peter does a complex order for a coffee (basically stating one cappuccino without any ingredients), and then paying him $5.00 and telling the clerk to keep the change (the amount was $4.97). Peter admits to Jason that he was being annoying, explaining that this was the reason he tipped him. Cue the three pennies being thrown towards Peter's head offscreen.

(Hilariously, before the exchange, the kid lectures Phoenix on the importance of equal value exchange of goods and services). Phoenix is only able to provide that rare card by trading <em>another</em> rare card to another collector.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">even funnier</a> now that Italy has switched to Euros and lire can't even be used.

<div class="indent"><strong>Butt-Head:</strong> Maybe <em>this</em> will change your mind?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOblongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOblongs">The Oblongs</a></em>, when it is suggested offhandedly that Bob consider filing a lawsuit after being injured by a Globocide park ride, Globocide's lawyers immediately offer him a "really big check." It is in fact a novelty check worth only $20, which Pickles points out. They simply say, "But look how big it is!"
</li><li> Murdoc Niccals of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a></em> was, as a child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse">forced to participate in embarrassing talent shows for money</a> by his father. "The prize? £2.50 and the chance to humiliate yourself further in the biannual county finals." To add insult to injury, he apparently never won.

When the man points out how stupid attempting to bribe with a dollar is, Carver replies that he was actually offering him a quarter.

Stimpy was bribed by a photographer to take a picture of a VIP for five dollars. When Stimpy doesn't take the bribe, the photographer raises the price to <em>one million</em> dollars, but Stimpy still won't fold. Later, he makes the same offer of five dollars to Ren. When Ren hesitates, the photographer begins to offer the million dollars before Ren enthusiastically cuts him off and takes the five dollars.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo">Camp Lazlo</a></em>: In "The Tusk Wizard", Raj attempts to bribe Nurse Leslie into removing a perfectly healthy tusk by offering him a quarter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeWarpTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeWarpTrio">Time Warp Trio</a></em> had some fun with this one. A man from the 30s offers The Girls $1, which is actually a lot of money back then. However, he unknowingly offers it to a trio of time travelers from 2105 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation">Ridiculous Future Inflation</a> in play, so they view it this way. There was also The Boys offering Blackbeard a quarter, which he views as a large bribe, before discovering it's effectively useless to him as no tavern will take it. In a straighter example, the number of times Joe offered to do (what is almost always recognized as, and if not, quickly discovered to be) a cheap parlor trick in exchange for passage through somewhere in a series that only has 24 episodes is mind boggling.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> contains an inversion: Scrooge and a rival are both trying to obtain a rare mask from a native tribe, and both are offering larger and larger bribes to try to get the chief to give them the mask. Scrooge's nephews, however, figure out that what's valued in this tribe is not money, but "a large belly," so they offer the chief a jar of high-fat, high-calorie peanut butter. The chief gives the mask to Scrooge on the spot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> has an episode where Dr. Zoidberg is trying to get the head of a Yeti from Mom, the richest person in the universe.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mom:</strong> It will cost you. <br/><strong>Zoidberg:</strong> But I am penniless! All that I have is this coupon for a free tanning! <br/><strong>Mom:</strong> <em>[genuinely concerned]</em> Is that really all you have? <em>[Zoidberg nods]</em> Then I'll take it!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> had this a few times, since the main characters were children and were bribing their fellow students. Aside from one occurrence where Gus didn't bring a permission slip to a carnival and TJ tried to bribe the teacher into letting him come anyway with a quarter.

<ul><li> Bloo frequently tries to buy others off with pocket change to no effect. Often he'll throw in an extra penny to try and sweeten the deal.
</li><li> In another episode, Coco has laid a bunch of trading cards featuring the friends at Foster's. After finding out his own card is extremely common and everyone uses it for things like coasters and leveling tables, he offers to trade one of his cards... autographed by him! Wilt points out that said autograph makes the card worth <em>even less</em>.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, Jon, Garfield, and Odie are attending a fancy restaurant where they are informed it will be an incredibly long wait for a table. Garfield hints to Jon that he should bribe the maitre d' to hurry things along, which he does... with a dime. The maitre d' (completely ironically of course) praises Jon's generosity and talks about how this one dime will change his life (e.g. he can now send his child to college), and all loud enough so the whole restaurant hears. Thoroughly embarrassed, Jon raises the value of the bribe considerably, which ultimately does get the maitre d' to find a table for them.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, the medieval fair owner offers the guy in the Reptar suit $10.00 to tackle Stu's out-of-control robotic dragon.

<ul><li> The German satirical magazine <em>Titanic</em> offered a cuckoo clock, sausages and ham to delegates of the FIFA World championship committee to support the German bid to host the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>.

South Africa did get the World Cup in 2010.
</li><li> On November 8, 2009, Chad Ochocinco of the Cincinnati Bengals offered an official $1 during a replay challenge on one of his own catches. Even though he was joking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he got hit with a $20,000 fine.</a>

As the cashier points out, even assuming he <em>did</em> have secret knowledge of the store's shipments, $20 is not worth the punishment he'd get for giving out such a secret.
</li><li> People find it amusing when politicians and bureaucrats revealed to have accepted bribes turn out to have accepted what seem to be ridiculously small bribes in exchange for their favour. A few million dollars, people can respect that. A few thousand dollars worth of <em>furniture</em>, on the other hand...
<ul><li> Though this could be them trying to seem subtle, a truckload of new furniture isn't nearly as suspicious as several thousand-ish dollars suddenly appearing in the bank.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>'s contests on his blog, such his limerick contest and photo caption contest have always given tiny rewards of "a shiny new dime." In the case of the caption contest, it became satirical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> when the winning entry was accused of plagiarism, and the prize given to another, only to find that it wasn't and for the original winner to receive his dime after all.
<ul><li> His "Outguess Ebert at the Oscars" defy this, as being official contests the prizes can range as high as a private screening to the years' Ebertfest or Pixar film. The most recent prize was the highest, $100,000, a year that Ebert only correctly guessed 15 Oscars out of 24.
</li></ul></li><li> Stephen Merchant's harrowing encounter with a nightclub bouncer certainly counts. It's one thing to flaunt your cash in front of some girls, quite another when that attempt consists of offering 7 quid on a 5 quid entry fee.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> offered to buy the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> franchise for $10,000. This was apparently not taken seriously, as the rights were up for sale, and ended up not being sold.
</li><li> A contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFortunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFortunes">Family Fortunes</a></em>, whose family had not covered themselves in glory, once offered to buy the rights to that episode so it would never be shown — for £100. The producer had to explain to them that this fell somewhat short of covering the show's £38,000 costs.
</li><li> The anti-corruption organization <a class="urllink" href="http://india.5thpillar.org/">5th Pillar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> prints <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_rupee_note">zero rupee notes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which are intended to shame officials who ask for bribes.
</li><li> Bribery often takes the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste">items of wealth and taste</a> rather then money because money seems less "classy". One mole in Russia was paid by the CIA with a custom sporting rifle, although in his case he intended to defect for ideological reasons and simply asked for the bribe on the "why not?" argument.
</li><li> When a painting was stolen from the Museum of Bad Art, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Bad_Art#Thefts">a reward of $6.50 was offered for its safe return<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The stakes were later raised to $36.73, but eventually it was returned with no ransom paid.
</li><li> North Korean border guards are reliably known to both Chinese and North Korean contraband smugglers to accept cans of Coke as an acceptable bribe to look the other way when going in or out of North Korea. Utterly priceless to the North Koreans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotRareOverThere">still a dollar or less per can to the Chinese</a>.
</li><li> The inverted version has happened numerous times in real life, usually either selling something for $1 or working for $1 a year. Although most of these people working on $1 salaries are <em>actually</em> paid in stock options and other perks that would easily be worth millions of dollars (it also serves as a convenient tax dodge; in America, income from stocks are taxed more leniently than salaries).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> was groped by a radio host by the name of David Mueller at a fan event after a concert in 2013 while they were taking a picture. She told his employer what happened and he was fired. He sued her for $3 million in damages for losing his job and for defamation in 2015. She countersued him for $1 for sexual assault. She won the case and dollar.
</li><li> The Knights Hospitalier were given the islands of Tripoli, Malta and Gozo by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1530. The yearly rent on all three (pretty sizeable) islands was a bird — a single Maltese falcon — and the Knights duly paid up until 1798. This is where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalteseFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMalteseFalcon">famous detective story's</a> title comes from.
</li><li> There exists a superstition that giving a knife as a gift is bad luck (symbolizing the severance of a relationship). Therefore, it is customary for those who believe this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">"buy" the knife instead</a>, with whatever small change they happen to have in their pocket at the time.
