<ul><li> Throughout the run of the series, Tom Paris is often drafted into doing nursing duties. Apparently taking an exobiology course in college (to impress a girl he was interested in) is the closest thing they've got to a nurse on board now that the entire medical staff has been killed (further justified as <em>Voyager</em> was on a military reconnaissance mission when it was sent to the Delta Quadrant rather than a standard Starfleet exploratory mission, and therefore may have lacked a standard full crew compliment of science-focused officers). And they do actually show Tom on several occasions stressed out pulling duty as nurse and pilot while trying to learn enough medicine to be at least competent whenever the Doctor is absent.
</li><li> The Emergency Medical Hologram itself is an example, being pressed into service as the Voyager's full-time Chief Physician after the aforementioned death of the entire medical staff. The EMH was never intended to be more than a short-term backup to the flesh-and-blood doctors, and certainly wasn't meant to be kept operational for years at a time.

Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredAssistant">Beleaguered Assistant</a> Spike turns out to be that someone. While not a bad choice, Twilight's plan to still fails, in part due to the other characters still being brainwashed into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbodimentOfVice">embodiments of vice</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: "Twisted Sister" has the girls create a fourth Powerpuff Girl when they have too many chores to do; but since they didn't add the proper ingredients and used substitutes (artificial sweetener for sugar, dirt and twigs for spice, and what they think is "everything nice" such as flowers, stuffed animals, computers, etc.), the girl comes out giant and grotesque.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> where Bart gets injured and needs legal representation, Lionel Hutz selects Nick Riviera as the medical expert for the upcoming lawsuit as he's "the only one in this room who's even close to a doctor", which Riviera treats as a compliment (the rest of the people in the room being Hutz, Homer and Marge). In another episode, the nerds attending a Stargate convention start hitting on Groundskeeper Willie because his kilt makes him the closest thing to a real girl they hope to get.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Randy Marsh often gets called to action as the town's only scientist. The thing is, he's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>: he's a geologist.
</li><li> When the hospital was understaffed, the doctor considered Chef qualified enough for having watched one episode of <em>Quincy</em>.
</li><li> When the US government sends a team through the portal to Imaginationland, they put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell">Kurt Russell</a> in command, because he was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">in that one movie that was kinda like this</a>," and that gave him the most experience.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: In the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsSparkOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsSparkOfRebellion">Spark of Rebellion</a> the crew of the <em>Ghost</em>'s plan for infiltration the Imperial transport requires that they have a wookie "prisoner" to hand over to the Imperials, however as they don't have any wookies on their crew they instead try to pass of Zeb as a "rare hairless wookie", which doesn't work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>: Don Carnage sent two pirates of his crew to break into Cape Suzette. One of them tried to be the boss of the other by claiming to have attended school. When the other dismissed the claim as false, the claimant then said he had already seen a school's photograph and the other pirate accepted this as a reason to let him lead.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Drop Zone", this trope is played relatively straight when Kid Flash and Robin argue over who should lead The Team.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kid Flash:</strong> You don't even have superpowers! <br/><strong>Robin:</strong> Neither does Batman! <br/><strong>Kid Flash:</strong> Duh! You're not Batman. <br/><strong>Robin:</strong> Duh! Closest thing we got!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There was once a documentary on a small town damaged by a storm, and at the local hospital, things got so bad that, at one point, one surgeon found himself to be the only medical professional in the building, with no one to help him with a surgical procedure he absolutely had to do on a patient. In desperation, he found a random guy in the hallway and drafted him to help. The guy had no medical training whatsoever, and was given a surgeon's gown, mask, gloves, and had to help out in performing surgery.
</li><li> The U.S. Secret Service originally was founded to investigate counterfeiting. However, since the U.S. Marshals lacked the manpower, and the other law enforcement agencies (such as the Park Rangers and Postal Inspectors) didn't fit the bill, the Service got stuck investigating most federal-level crimes. This continued until the FBI and other dedicated agencies were created and took over some of those responsibilities.
<ul><li> Also the reason why a former Treasury Department agency is responsible for protecting the most powerful leader on the planet. They were the closest thing Congress had to do the job at the time (<em>literally</em> the closest thing — the Secret Service's headquarters used to be right up the street from where Congress met). When it became clear (on account <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley">assassinations</a> in 36 years) that dedicated bodyguards for the President were a necessity, it was quicker to re-purpose some of the existing Secret Service agents than to create a new agency for the job. It had the added benefit of not being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">(para)military unit</a> and thus avoiding the US's fear of over-militarization dating back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> and having the President protected by civilians fit well into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">Just the First Citizen</a> spiel in a world full of reigning and ruling monarchs.
</li></ul></li><li> Skippy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippysList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippysList">Skippy's List</a> fame was at one point assigned as unit interpreter during a deployment in Albania by virtue of having been deployed in another country nearby previously and owning an English-to-Serbo-Croat (<em>not</em> Albanian) dictionary.
</li><li> Want to know why <em>Ida</em> had two credited cinematographers? Original cinematographer Ryszard Lenczewski left production after 10 days for disputed reasons <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yz0x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yz0x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yz0x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Lenczewski claims for medical reasons, while director Pawel Pawlikowski claims it was because of disinterest, and vowed to never work with him again. </span> and camera operator Lukasz Zal was hired to fill in the vacant slot.
</li><li> If you cook or bake on a regular basis, you will be familiar with this trope. Recipe calls for almonds and you don't have any? Hazelnuts will do in a pinch. Don't have a deep frying machine? Surely a pot with oil in it will have the same effect.
</li><li> In times of crisis this tends to happen quite a lot. In the aftermath of World War II, the Reichsmark while still technically legal tender had lost all purchasing power, but goods and services had to be paid for somehow, so cigarettes (rare, durable, can be stored, can be broken down in small value units, have an intrinsic value) became one of several modes of payment, along with all-out bartering.
</li><li> An out-universe example with the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList">Schindler's List</a></em>: after seeing a rough cut of the film, composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnWilliams">John Williams</a> told director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> that he deserved a better composer. Spielberg replied, "I know, but they're all dead."
</li><li> A video-game genre-wide example can be found in racing games with real-life cars. In 2000, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> struck a deal with Porsche with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</a></em> that gave the company exclusive rights to use Porsche cars in their games. All other major racing game franchises were suddenly unable to use an iconic brand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Cool Cars</a>, so they resorted to using Ruf cars instead... which are modified Porsche models. The way these franchises used Ruf cars as stand-in for Porsche was only made more apparent by the fact that, after Electronic Arts's deal expired in 2016, these other companies completely stopped adding Ruf cars to their new games and went back to using Porsche cars instead... and the games that were being updated during the deal expiration outright <em>removed</em> all Ruf cars to replace them with Porsche ones.
</li><li> When studying how extinct animals lived, paleontologists will look to the animal's closest living relative(s) for clues. Or, they'll look to another unrelated animal that filled a similar niche, or had similar morphology, and likely lived and behaved in a similar way (even if it's not closely related to the animal being studied).
</li><li> This trope tends to pop up in arts and crafts, particularly when a craft supply is hard to find in certain colors. Don't have a piece of paper that's red on one side and black on the other? Get a red sheet and a black sheet, and glue them together. Don't have black paper at all? Use dark blue. Can't find gray and peach-colored pony beads? Clear with silver glitter and light orange might work. If all else fails, you may be able to paint whatever you <em>do</em> have the appropriate color.
