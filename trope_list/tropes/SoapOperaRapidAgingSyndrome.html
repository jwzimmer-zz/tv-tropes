<ul><li> Jim Gordon's kids in the Chris Nolan <em>Batman</em> films. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, a scene where Batman goes to talk to then Sergeant Gordon briefly shows Gordon's wife feeding a baby in a high chair. Six months are supposed to have passed between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, but the kids now look to be a lot older — their actors were seven and ten at the time of the film's release. This was apparently done so that Gordon could have a deeper relationship with the son but it causes a headache trying to figure out exactly what the timeline for the two films was.
</li><li> Sean and Michael Brody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> are little kids in the first film. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2">the second</a>, Sean's still a kid while Michael is a teenager. The following two films got around the issue by making them both adults.

When he and Adrian return home at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV">Rocky V</a></em>, his son is now in early adolescence.

</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a></em>, when Joseph reunites with his younger brother Benjamin in Egypt, the latter is a "young boy" (Gn 44.22). A while later when Israel's whole family comes to Egypt too, the "child" is father of ten sons (Gn 46.21). Realistically, though, he <em>should</em> be an adult, having been born before Joseph was sold into slavery twenty-two years earlier; the fact that the story temporarily treats him like a child is an odd fluke.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>, amazingly enough: In book three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid">The Aeneid</a></em>, Ascanius, Aeneas' son, is young enough for Dido to hold him on her lap. By the next book, which takes place no more than a year later, he's old enough to ride a horse and command the respect of the other Trojans. (Virgil originally wrote Ascanius as being old enough to command men, then began a rewrite where Ascanius was younger and managed to get the first three books done, before suffering a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>.)
</li><li> Deliberately invoked by the witches in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em> when the witches realize their Hero is only 3 years old. Instead of waiting for him to grow older, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">move the entire kingdom of Lancre 15 years into the future</span>
</li><li> In the novel <em>The Amorous Umbrella</em> (sequel to <em>The Incredible Umbrella</em>), our hero ends up in a universe based in 1950's soap opera tropes, where he is trapped for several years. Being a dimensional outsider, he <em>notices</em> the SORAS cases, but nobody else does, even when it's pointed out to them. It worries him that a stepson he acquired, now an infant, will be an adult in five or six years and may - in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">Oedipus Rex</a>-inspired plotline common with 1950's soap operas - attempt to kill him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em>, when Lazarus Long saves Dora from her parents' burning house, she seems to age several years over at most a few weeks. When her father tosses her out the window and Lazarus catches her, she seems to be a toddler (he identifies her at first sight as a "baby"). On the ride into town, she talks well enough to be three years old or so. When he takes her to visit her parents' grave not long afterward, she acts kindergarten age at least. Of course, Heinlein's later fiction has a sentimental preoccupation with what he calls "baby girls," by which he can mean any human female who hasn't reached puberty, so maybe he wasn't sure himself how old Dora was when Lazarus adopted her. Since Lazarus is several thousand years old when telling the story, this could be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdrianMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdrianMole">Adrian Mole</a></em> series, Glenn is born in 1990, but is already twelve years old in 1997 (when Adrian discovers he is Glenn's father) and then becomes a soldier in 2002 at age seventeen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears">The Berenstain Bears</a></em>. It starts out with Small (later, Brother) Bear. According to <em>The Berenstain Bears and the New Baby</em> he went exploring, snorkeling, and kayaking by himself. Then, Sister Bear was born. The next book, she was about two years younger than Brother. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">30 years later</a> Honey Bear was born. Honey rapidly aged to toddlerhood, and in <em>The Berenstain Bears Go Back To School</em>, it is revealed that Brother is entering 3rd grade and Sister is in 1st. That means Brother was 2 when Sister was born, and Sister was 5 when Honey was born (and Mama was pregnant essentially the entire Bear canon). This includes the Bear Scout series (Cub Scouts are required to be in first grade before entering), and the chapter books where Sister is implied to be in at least 5th or 6th grade.
</li><li> A minor example in Nora Roberts'/JD Robb's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em> where Mavis's daughter Bella is born in January of 2060, and by the summer she is walking and talking.

<ul><li> Victoria Newman aged from 8 or so to 15 in a single winter in 1991, after aging more or less in real time up to that point. Then three years later, the same thing happened to her younger brother Nicholas. And it has since happened to Nick's children and various other assorted younger characters.
</li><li> Colleen Carlton was one of them. Born onscreen in 1992, she was written out in 1995. She returned six years later, played by 15-year-old Lyndsy Fonseca.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em>:
<ul><li> The cumulative effect of this led to Tom Horton and his great-great-grandson Scotty Banning both working as doctors in the same hospital <em>at the same time</em>.
</li><li> When the believed-stillborn Georgia Brady was found alive and raised under the name "Chelsea," she had also been SORASED; as a result, at one point her love interest was Dr. Daniel Jonas, who had also slept with her grandmother, Kate Roberts, with both age differences being only mildly creepy.
</li><li> Shawn-Douglas Brady (born onscreen in 1987), Belle Black (born in 1993), and Philip Kiriakis (born in 1995) suddenly became high-school classmates in 1999. Shawn was aged up relatively slightly, while Belle went upstairs as a little girl one day and came down a teenager the next. Philip was basically fresh off a storyline where his embryo was stolen from his parents and implanted in another woman.
<ul><li> Belle and Shawn's daughter Claire was born onscreen in 2005 and left the show as a baby; she returned as a teenager in 2015, five or six extra years older.
</li><li> Shawn's mother Hope Brady was SORAS'd herself, being born onscreen in 1974 but aged up several years in the 1980s.
</li><li> Belle's brother Brady Black was born on the show in 1992 but was in high school by the end of the decade. He even became older than Shawn, who had been present as a toddler at his birth!
</li></ul></li><li> Nicholas Alamain was portrayed as a child by Erik von Detten, who was 10 or 11 when he left the show in 1993. He came back briefly in 1999, played by 26-year-old Victor Webster, gaining a decade and figuring in a steamy romance. He was next seen in 2011, subverting the trope by being slightly younger than in his previous appearance, played by 23-year-old Cody Longo.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the strangest cases, Will Horton was born in November of 1995 and E.J. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiMera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiMera">Di Mera</a> was born in April of 1998. By the mid-2000s, E.J. had been rapidly aged to a man in his mid-late 20s, and contemporary in age to Will's mother. Will lagged behind in the rapid aging, resulting in him being older than his own stepfather out of universe, but younger in-universe.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>:
<ul><li> Though not as pronounced, Maxie Jones went from toddler to 7 years old in a few weeks, as well. Notable because she would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">eventually be played</a> by the same actress who played SORAS-ed Belle (Kirsten Storms).
</li><li> Sonny Corinthos' son Michael was put into a coma that lasted for a year. When he awoke, he was at least 6-10 years older and played by a new actor. His brother Morgan and then-adopted half-sister Kristina were also aged accordingly, and returned played by new actors. The newly teenaged Michael <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by asking Kristina: "When did you become such a hottie?"
</li><li> Lulu Spencer was born in 1994 and portrayed by various child actors for 10 years. She then reappeared as a 17-year old in 2005.
</li><li> Averted with Elizabeth Webber's son Cameron, born in 2004. The actor currently playing the role was actually born in 2005.
</li><li> Laura Vining Webber Baldwin Spencer Collins went from approximately age eight in the summer of 1976 to disappearing from the show and then returning in the winter of 1977 aged about 15.
</li><li> GH also contains one of the more notable aversions in American daytime: Robin Scorpio, who's been played by the same actress (Kimberly McCullough) since 1985, when both were six years old.
</li></ul></li><li> Both an example and an aversion, also on ABC, is the character of Starr Manning on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>. The character was born in 1996, and aged to six when Kristen Alderson started playing the character several months before her seventh birthday in 1998. The character and actress aged at the same rate.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em>:
<ul><li> Luke Snyder was originally born in 1995. Since then, his character has been SORAS-ed two times; in 2001, when nine-year-old Christopher Tavani took over the role, and 2005, when fifteen-year-old Jake Weary played the part. He aged more or less normally when Van Hansis finally took over the role.
</li><li> Chris Hughes who was born on-screen in 1986; by 2003, he was a doctor.
</li><li> Tom Hughes was born onscreen in 1961; by the late 1970s, he'd been to Vietnam and back and was attending law school.

<ul><li> Bridget Forrester born on-air in 1992 turned 13 in 1997, and turned 18 in 2000. She has aged naturally since then.
</li><li> Hope Logan was born in 2002 and for several years aged naturally, portrayed by child actors of respective age. In 2010, however, a 21-year old actress took over.
</li></ul></li><li> Among a <em>host</em> of SORAS-ed characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em>:
<ul><li> J.R. Chandler, born 1989, an adult husband and father since 2003.
</li><li> Jamie Martin, born 1991, a med student.
</li><li> Colby Chandler, born 1999, somehow celebrated her 16th birthday in 2006.
</li><li> When we first met Lily Montgomery in 1993, she was played by 8-year-old Michelle Trachtenberg. In 2004, she's 16 and was portrayed by 14-year old Leven Rambin.
</li><li> In 1993, 15-year old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> portrayed 16-year old Kendall Hart, Erica Kane's long-lost daughter. However, due to timeline discrepancies, 16-year old Kendall was instantly aged from a teenaged girl to 22/23 years old several months later. Nonetheless, when the character returned in 2002 under Alicia Minshew, Kendall's birthdate was reverted <em>back</em> to September 25, 1976, Kendall's original birthdate, making her a 16-year girl again in 1993 - undoing the earlier SORAS-ing of Kendall.
</li><li> Subverted with Miranda Montgomery, born 2004, went from being played by a ten-year-old Mackenzie Aladjem in 2011, to the 19 year-old Denyse Tontz. Due to the five-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, it's more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>. However the other wiki didn't mention her age.
</li></ul></li><li> Louis Fairhead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty">Casualty</a></em>. His on-screen birth took place in 1996 and he stated he was 10 years old in 2006. A year later he was a rebellious teenager who smoked cannabis and accidentally set his high school on fire. He impregnated a woman in 2010 when he would have been 14 but by this point his year of birth had been changed to 1992 and it was repeatedly announced that he was now 18.
</li><li> British soaps like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders">EastEnders</a></em> are surprisingly void of this trope. Characters either have the same actor from childhood, or, as a child, they move away, and years later come back as a different actor (but, importantly, as the correct age for the time they have been away). They generally pull this off by having an invisible age between being a baby and a small child where the character is not seen (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>'s Tracy Barlow, for example, spent several years "upstairs, listening to music", before she was finally old enough to do interesting things like have a teenage marriage, or sell her baby from a later relationship (only to decide she wanted it back when she set her sights on the father again), or murder her abusive/cheating boyfriend. It does happen occasionally, but only by a year or two - Ian Beale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders">EastEnders</a></em> turned 21 two years after turning 18. Probably the most famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> example was Mark Redman: When he was reintroduced in 1992, he was suddenly in high school and the same age as Nicky Platt, despite being born on screen in 1983, two years after him. Another minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Corrie</a> example is Dev Alahan's twin children Aadi and Asha, who were born on-screen in 2006 but at some point had their ages fudged to skip a year, as they turned ten in 2015.
<ul><li> British soaps are prime-time and generally get a bit more critical respect than their US counterparts, making tropes like this rather discredited. That the soaps are intended to occur approximately in real time also helps (as in an episode is generally set on the date it airs on TV), so it's expected that characters age exactly as the actors do. It also makes the actors want to stay on longer, and given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">lengthy</a> nature, this can lead to some impressive stints. The character of Ken Barlow was part of the original cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> in 1960 - he is still there, has aged appropriately, and has always been played by the same actor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Passions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Passions">Passions</a></em> had two: Little Ethan and Endora.
</li><li> The Finnish soap opera <em>Salatut Elämät</em> has two kids first age from babies to schoolchildren during one summer, and later, from that to teenagers, during a time which in show accounted for one apartment fire. Incidentally, one of the kids helped catch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> bad guy, yet she was kidnapped by said bad guy when she was a kid just one season ago.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em> doesn't go to the extremes of US soaps, there's still a noticeable trend of introducing or reintroducing characters into established families old enough to have been born before their parents got together or sometimes even met:
<ul><li> This syndrome is especially prominent in the Robinson family, beginning with Lucy Robinson being suddenly aged up about two years after changing actors in 1987. Likewise, her third actor was a year older than the second.
</li><li> Lucinda "Elle" Robinson was born off-screen in October 1989, when she returned in September 2005, she should have been fifteen going on sixteen. Instead, she was closer to eighteen or nineteen, and her parents Paul and Gail didn't get together until 1987. By extension, this applies to her brothers Cameron and Robert. The triplets' case appears to have gotten worse in 2019, with the introduction of Robert's daughter Harlow, born from a brief fling when he was backpacking in 2002. This would require Robert to be about 16 going by their <em>retconned</em> age, so he may have been aged up again to match his actor Adam Hunter (born 1982, as was Elle's actress Pippa Black). But it doesn't help that Harlow's mother's actress Denise Van Outen is still several years older than him (born 1974). Incidentally, the fact that Harlow is played by the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDonovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDonovan">Jason Donovan</a> creates a somewhat amusing effect given that his character Scott is her great-uncle.
</li><li> Paul's first daughter Amy was conceived during his brief career as a flight attendant in 1985 but was stated to be three and a half in 1988 and a nine-year-old in 1992. May have been rectified after her 2015 return, though her actress Zoe Cramond was born in 1984.
</li><li> Rebecca believed (or rather hoped) that Paul was the father of her son Oliver, the result of a weekend fling when he was a flight attendant (again, for a few months in 1985). However, onscreen evidence states that Oliver was born in 1981, and his actor David Hoflin was born in 1979.
</li><li> Hannah Martin is introduced as eight years old in 1992, but is later identified as sixteen in 1999 despite being portrayed by the same actor. Worse, her parents Philip and Julie didn't even get together until 1985, and she wouldn't have been born until at least 9 months after that.
</li><li> Louise "Lolly" Carpenter, born onscreen in 1994, left in 2001, reintroduced in early 2007 as a 15-year-old played by Adelaide Kane. Not only would this imply she was born before Lou and Cheryl had even met (or by extension, Cheryl's affair with John Allen), she would have been born before Lou was even living in Ramsay St. May have been reversed after her original actor made an appearance in late 2013.
</li><li> Serena Bishop, introduced as a 15-year-old in October 2003 even though her father David had been last seen in May 1988, still single.
</li><li> Ben Kennedy/Kirk was born onscreen in December 2001, but appeared to be eight upon returning in 2007, and as of June 2014, he was a Year 10 student (15-16). May have been slightly rectified since, as he was still in high school in 2017. Either way, like the above examples it's still skirting the timeframe of Libby and Drew's relationship.
</li><li> When Liz Conway's guest stint in 2002 ended, she was pregnant with her second daughter. This daughter, Bea Nilsson, would be introduced in 2018, in her early 20s.
</li><li> Inverted with Jack Scully, who was introduced as a 19-year-old in 2001 who had been living and working in the UK away from his family for a few years. He was reintroduced late the following year under a new actor and aged down about two years so he could attend Erinsborough High.
</li><li> Inverted with Andrew Robinson (ironically, considering his family history): born onscreen in November 1991, reintroduced as a 16-year-old in late 2009. His retconned birthdate(s) in August 1993 would require him to be born about a year after Paul and Christina left the street for Hawaii, but just before Paul briefly returned and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell">Put on a Bus to Hell</a>.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Summer Hoyland - first introduced as a 9-year-old in 2002, started high school and turned 13 in 2004 (same actor), spent a few years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommutingOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommutingOnABus">Commuting on a Bus</a> before disappearing (around the time her father and brother left the street), reintroduced under a new actor as a 16-year-old in 2010.
</li><li> Probably the most extreme example was Holly Hoyland, who was born onscreen in 2007 but managed to be 15 by 2018, which again would require her to be conceived before her mother Isabelle was even living in the street and had met Karl..
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em>:
<ul><li> Duncan Stewart (son of Alf and Ailsa) - originally aging normally from baby to toddler to young child, the character then disappeared only to reappear two years older the following season.
</li><li> Also Martha, who arrived as an 18 year-old going on 19 in 2005, despite being born onscreen in 1988.
</li><li> Olivia Fraser Richards, born on screen in 1999, managed to be eight years old in 2005. When she returned as a teenager a decade later, her age skipped about alarmingly with her going from 17 down to 16 and then turning 18 less than two years later, which <em>still</em> made her younger than either of the earlier ages.
</li><li> However, it should be noted that the show otherwise averts this, with Sally Fletcher being the most obvious example.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em>:
<ul><li> First it gives us Leah Bauer. Sending her to boarding school when she was about a year old was one thing, but when she came back a year later she was 14, twelve years older than her <em>older brother.</em>
</li><li> Phillip Spaulding was introduced in 1977 as being approximately eight years old; after leaving for a time in 1980, he was recast and returned in 1982, now played by 22-year old Grant Aleksander. The character's age progression, from 1982 on, paralleled that of Aleksander, who would continue to play Phillip, off and on, through Guiding Light's 2009 cancellation.
</li><li> Chrissy Blake Thorpe was a little kid in the late 70s, was gone for 8 years, returned as a full adult. One of the better cases at least.
</li></ul></li><li> New Zealand's <em>Shortland Street</em> does this to Tuesday Warner, played by Olivia Tennet (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Dr. K</a>). Although born in 1995, she comes back to Ferndale in 2007 at fourteen years old.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>, four-year-old Morgan Matthews <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">disappeared</a> for a season or so, then unexpectedly reappeared significantly older. This was lampshaded when one character commented on her long absence and she said, "That was the longest time-out I've ever had."
<ul><li> Cory, Shawn and Topanga also age an extra two years; Mr. Feeny says in an early episode that they're part of the Class of 2000, but they graduate from high school in 1998. This appears to be a Matthews family trait; baby Joshua was born in 1999 but seemed to be two or three years old in 2000 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GirlMeetsWorld">and 17 in 2014</a>).

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em>, Andrew is born late in season 3 and is played by twin babies (Garrett and Tyler Merriman) in season 4, but at the start of season 5 he's suddenly being played by a then-five-year-old Brian Bonsall, who then stays for the duration (seasons 5-7).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">called attention to this</a> when it replaced the newborn Nicky Banks with a six-year-old actor (Ross Bagley): Nicky walked in the room while Jazz was talking to Will, prompting the former to ask who he was. Will says "That's baby Nicky!" while mugging to the camera and making a "growing" gesture with his hands. A frustrated Jazz shouts "Man, I'm going back to the streets where things make sense!" (Will also does a double-take when he sees "older" Nicky for the first time and Jazz enters the scene asking if Aunt Viv has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">recast again</a>) This of course, is the same show where Will once asks why the house doesn't have a ceiling (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">followed by a camera pan upwards to show the studio lights</a>).
<ul><li> Played straight with Ashley, who's said to be 9 in early season 1 episodes but in "Just Infatuation" later that season she's celebrating her 12th birthday.
</li><li> Inverted and with Will and Carlton. In a season 1 episode they said they were born in 1973 and 1974, respectively, which would've put them at 16 and 17 years old on the airdate. But they didn't graduate high school until season 3 and in a season 4 episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Will says he was 15</a> when he moved to Bel-Air.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> was a little bit more subtle about this. Jesse and Rebecca's twin boys Nicky and Alex go from infants in season 5 to pre-verbal, long haired toddlers in season 6. Not as egregious as most examples, but a bit noticeable. Completely averted with Michelle, who starts off about 1 year old and grows at normal speed. Of course, they kept the same actresses for Michelle, which would've made it hard to pull off.
</li><li> Quentin Kelly went from being around eleven to about fifteen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceUnderFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceUnderFire">Grace Under Fire</a></em> when Jon Paul Steuer left the show <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0decl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0decl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0decl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Allegedly his mother pulled him out due to Rhett Butler's increasingly erratic off-camera behavior, the last straw being an incident where Butler decided to "show off" her new breast implants by flashing the cast and crew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">including (12 year old) Steuer</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a></em> also featured this trope with Chrissy, though they didn't implement it for until a season after the actual birth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em> did this to Boyd, who started at 2 in the first season and went to 5 in the second. His mother Kristin had Boyd when she was 17, and that remained true as well, making her 19 in the first season and suddenly 23 in the second. Everyone else remained the same age. Also notable in that Boyd had very little presence in the first season, limited to just being carried around and/or being told he is a handful, while he became an active character in the second season by virtue of just being able to hold a conversation, also with some minor sub plots surrounding him.
</li><li> Lily on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>. The two-year-old twins who originally played her became increasingly difficult to work with during season two, and were replaced by four year old Aubrey Anderson-Emmons for the next season (also making it an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a>). The age-up is minimal: Lily celebrates her second birthday in February 2011, but is stated to be three by September of the same year, then carries on ageing as normal. The slight discrepancy gets further covered up by a couple of time-skips in Seasons 3 and 5 that account for about six months in the series' timeline altogether, but if you're paying attention you can still tell she's skipped a birthday somewhere in there, as her age used to correspond to the number of seasons the show had run for (e.g. she turned 2 in Season 2), but she's now one year ahead (she's explicitly stated to be 6 in Season 5, 7 in Season 6, etc...). The fact that the writers usually go out of their way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Show Their Work</a> in having the characters have actual birthdays that they celebrate at the same time every year makes this more noticeable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily">My Family</a></em> appears to take place in real-world time with a year between each series (judging by in-show references and the Christmas specials) but Kenzo, born in series four, is mentioned as being nine years old in series ten. Also extends to Janey, who is fifteen years old in the first series and claims to be "almost 30" in the tenth.
</li><li> Defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaisingHope">Raising Hope</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingUseOfTheTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingUseOfTheTwin">the twins</a> playing Hope grow up in the show and done deliberately because she was vital to the shows premise, going through all the normal stages of childhood development (sleeping through the night, potty training, staying in bed, etc). This has added to its charm, as the show made great use of her reaction shots without being cloying and they would talk in halted phrases later in the shows run. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">notably different, dark haired, baby</a> used in the pilot.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> where Darlene's daughter Harris was born in 1997 and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool">High School</a> freshman at the start of the 2018 continuation season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep">Step by Step</a></em> featured Lily, the baby of the family aging from an infant in one season, to a speaking toddler of pre-school age in the next - Presumably because the writers realized they had no idea what to do with a baby other than making jokes about her keeping the rest of the family awake at night.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackish">Blackish</a></em>: The twins Diane and Jack are originally mentioned to be six years old in the first season.

Since the miniseries was only four hours long, the creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> this by saying that Aeryn, from being born into a Peacekeeper battle regiment, had been genetically modified so that her pregnancy would only last a week or so. She goes from completely flat to big-belly pregnant almost in-between scenes. They also use the explanation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> (and presumably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>) allow Peacekeeper females to hold pregnancies in stasis for up to 7 years (to prevent complications due to female soldiers becoming untimely pregnant) makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> that pregnancies progress rapidly once released plausible.
</li><li> Tommen Baratheon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>. For seasons 1 and 2, he was portrayed by 10-year-old Callum Wharry, in a mostly background, non-speaking role. The character was absent for season 3, but for season 4 the role was recast with 16-year-old Dean-Charles Chapman. This is done after his character becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his brother's death.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer">Ghost Whisperer</a></em>, Delia's son Ned aged from a boy just celebrating his 13th birthday (actually was a part of the plot in one episode), to a high school Junior (at <em>least</em>) in less than six months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>: Diana Schade-Renard was whisked away as an infant in the last episode of season 5. She returned a girl of around 5 midway through season 6. She is 3/4 <em>hexenbiest</em> though so this may ultimately be a factor of her supernatural biology.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> and the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeroesReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeroesReborn">Heroes Reborn</a></em> is supposed to be about the same length of time between the former show going off the air and the latter debuting. The character of Molly Walker, however, was recast with an actress three years older—and the original series' Molly was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Cast</a> to begin with, being only 7 or 8 at the series' start and being portrayed by a 10-year-old.
</li><li> Done deliberately in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderSkyrider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderSkyrider">Kamen Rider: Skyrider</a></em>. One episode has Hiroshi and co being tasked with looking after a baby named Bongo by a mysterious woman. Over the next few days, Bongo ages at a phenomenal rate, to the point he looks 8 years old after a week. Its then revealed that Bongos father is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, who set up the whole thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">to kill Hiroshi</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> had this problem with Walt from the start. The events of Season 1 lasted only 44 days, yet his actor already aged well over a year - compare his scenes in The Pilot to his Flashback in Exodus, which showed events of the same day. The only realistic solution available to writers was to have him be kidnapped by others and all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> resulted in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: his appearances in Seasons 2 and 3 were brief and were shot in such a way as to disguise his new height. They were able to show him more after the show made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> of three years, yet he still aged way too much in that time period.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>. Although multiple child actors are used to portray the growing children in the cast, they don't grow any faster than the timeline dictates. (The show tends to jump forward about a year between seasons.) Meanwhile, because the show runners want to hold onto Kiernan Shipka's outstanding acting talent, Sally Draper actually appears to age <em>slower</em> than the show's calendar would dictate.
<ul><li> Flat-out inverted in Bobby's case; he was recast three times for a total of four actors with the result that he was no younger than 4 or 5 in 1960 but somehow still not a teenager in 1970.
</li></ul></li><li> The Turkish series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnificentCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnificentCentury">Magnificent Century</a></em> being set in a harem means that pregnancy is a big plot point, but the ages of the babies once they're born rarely make any sense. By the end of season one, one character has had three babies, and the youngest was born long enough ago that she is pregnant again, so at least two but probably closer to three years pass since the start of the season, though not more. Explicitly-stated five year old Mustafa ages four to eight years between one episode and the next, with no timeskip, while infant Mehmet is just as abruptly replaced with a toddler who can walk (conveniently, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrayingBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrayingBaby">his ability to crawl</a> is pertinent to the first episode he's aged up in). Mirimah quickly goes from a baby to a walking, talking toddler between episodes, too. Presumably the creators realized it wasn't possible for all of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hurrem</span>'s children to be infants at the same time, especially since the season ends with her pregnancy.
<ul><li> At one point, the actress playing Mahidevran and the actor playing her son Mustafa are five years apart. And that's before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC">The O.C.</a></em>, Kaitlin Cooper is referred to as a fifth-grader. Two seasons later, she's fourteen, which means an extra year has been added on somewhere. It's an interesting case because the new actress was only a few months older.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>, the teenage Octavian goes off to war for a year or two and returns as a man, played by a new, older actor. Several characters note how different he looks, with one blaming military rations. The physical change coincides with a change in Octavius' character from the clever child Octavius to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Caesar Agustus.
<ul><li> Also inverted with Vorenus' children. Vorena the younger is played by the same pre-teen actress throughout the entire series, despite the show covering somewhere between ten and twenty years. Baby Lucius ages up to around seven but then stays that age despite Caesarion, who is several years younger than him, growing to about ten years of age.
</li><li> Both points can be blamed on the series' cancellation halfway through Season 2. Had the show lasted the 5 projected years, all original actors would have aged at the right pace and no recast would have been needed.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted and played straight on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>. Miles was adopted in 1985, while Gabi was born in 1989, but they both graduated from high school in 2006.
</li><li> Why wait until the child is even <em>born?</em> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a>,</em> Teyla goes from not visibly pregnant at all and still trying to undertake semi-dangerous missions to <em>hugely</em> pregnant between episodes. A conversation from the previous episode is referenced in a way that makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> seem unlikely. Possibly explainable by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>, but as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> are descended from actual humans, that, too, is unlikely.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12grb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12grb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12grb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was a case of real life intruding - the actress playing Teyla really was pregnant. The actual length of the pregnancy is reasonably sensible, but due to differences between the filming schedule and the time supposedly passing between episodes it appears to progress rather erratically.</span>
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> example that is not a Plot-Relevant Age-Up: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>'s Tora Ziyal. Yes, she's an adult when we meet her, but she's played by three actresses: first the then-21 Cyia Batten, followed by 26-year-old Tracy Middendorf, and finally, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the writers decided she was going to be romantically involved with Garak</a>, 33-year-old Melanie Smith. That's 12 years of aging in one season's worth of episodes (Batten's last appearance is in 4.14, Smith's first is 5.14.) Though the <em>character</em> technically didn't age (super-rapidly, at any rate), the constant actor switching led to some confusion about just how old Ziyal was supposed to be.

</li><li> Naomi from Voyager's sudden skipping of a few years to take her from infant to major recurring character, her usual actress being her third.
</li></ul></li><li> Memory Alpha, the Star Trek wiki, even refers to Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome by name in both these cases. It's especially glaring when aliens who live twice as long as humans grow up in one-third the time. Naomi's, however, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> by her character being part alien.
</li><li> The trope is also mentioned by Memory Alpha for Molly O'Brien, who was born in "Disaster" and inexplicably aged at three, maybe four times the usual rate to add some pathos to "Rascals"...according to most of the ways used to relate stardates to our timekeeping, anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>, Poison Ivy was a kid (Claire Foley) but rapidly aged into a more mature version of herself (Maggie Geha).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em>: Topa has aged from an egg to a baby to being about ten years old between the first and second seasons, much like Alexander in TNG. This may be a result of Moclan physiology however, as Dr. Finn's sons appear to have only aged a year or so between Seasons 1 and 2.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inversion">Inversion</a>: when Zoey Bartlet was introduced in the first season, she was stated to be 19.

<ul><li> In the first decade of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em>, some characters aged far more rapidly than others. Notably:
<ul><li> Schroeder, introduced in early 1951 as an infant, within a year became first a toddler piano prodigy, and then not only fully verbal but apparently the same age as Charlie Brown, Shermy and friends.
</li><li> Lucy was a crib-bound toddler in her first appearances, and aged until she reached a point where she's apparently slightly older than Charlie Brown (based on the fact that Charlie Brown and her little brother, Linus, are usually depicted as being in the same class).
</li><li> Linus, introduced in late 1952, was somewhere between infant and toddler for two years, and a typical preschooler for the next year or two. Then, in 1957, he rapidly became the precocious Christian theologian he would remain ever after. (He never gave up his security blanket, however.)
</li><li> Also happened later on. Sally Brown was the first character born into the strip, in 1961 (Snoopy mentions waiting "until her eyes are open" to go visit her). Theoretically, this should make her at least several years younger than the rest of the cast. But by the early 70s she was more or less the same age as Linus. Similarly, almost overnight in the 90s, Rerun Van Pelt went from a toddler to kindergarten age.
</li><li> Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">the characters are still kids</a> when the comic ended in 2000.

Fourteen real-world years later, the sourcebook <em>Legacy of the Blood: Great Families of the Core</em> depicts this same Gerard as still dying in 733 ... but as a teenager <em>applying for medical school</em>.

<ul><li> Curiously, this happens to the Princes in the Tower in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a>,</em> if one assumes continuity with <em>Henry VI Part III.</em> In the final scene of the latter play, Henry VI has just been murdered and Edward IV has just become the father of a son. Then, in the early scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a>,</em> Henry's recently-deceased corpse is brought onstage, indicating that not much time has passed between plays (Richard has a line that suggests it's three months, but that is its own set of problems); a few scenes later, we meet Edward's son, now a pre-teen with a younger brother. This is all the result of Shakespeare's condensation of the historical timeline.

For example, in either game it's quite likely that a baby born while her/his older sibling is in high school will itself start high school before the older kid graduates. Later patches for the game allow you to set the length of each age group to avoid this.

Keep in mind that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a> was also featured in those arcade games and since then, he hasn't aged at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> games, the aging of your child is rarely consistent with reality. But the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example is probably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade">Harvest Moon: Animal Parade</a></em>, with the rival children. Two weeks after they're born, bam—the rival children suddenly and rapidly age to being about six or seven years old, with zero explanation, and then they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">stay that way for all eternity.</a>
</li><li> Bipin and Blossom's son in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em> grows from a baby to a child during the course of the first game you play, then into a teenager during a linked game.
</li><li> Coco was originally presented as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a>'s pre-teen/young teen sister. Beginning with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart">Crash Nitro Kart</a></em> she hit a growth spurt and her design became more mature-looking, ditching the overalls for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">a short t-shirt</a> and jeans.

Peter comments on this in the pilot episode. Subverted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's revealed that Fat Cleveland Jr. is actually a spy who killed and replaced the original Cleveland Jr.</span>
<ul><li> In one episode, Peter donates sperm, which results in a lesbian couple giving birth to Bertram, the same kid Stewie met when he went into Peter to prevent them from having more kids. In the course of apparently no time at all, Bertram ages to about Stewie's age (about age 1). Either that, or a year passed and nobody but Bertram changed.
<ul><li> While the character's models haven't changed, the characters have aged about 2 years. Meg goes from 16 and learning to drive during the first season to 18 and "legal" over the course of the series. Chris also goes from middle school to high school. Stewie, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">remains approximately 1 year old.</a>

<ul><li> Apu's children were conceived and aged from newborn babies to kids old enough to walk and talk.
</li><li> The first ten seasons included occasional appearances by Apu's brother Sanjay, who himself had two children, before all three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">stopped appearing</a>. The son, Jamshed, actually returned in season 27 as a teenager who just got back from college—in his first appearance he was clearly younger than Bart and Lisa.
</li><li> Between "The Great Louse Detective" and "The Italian Bob", Sideshow Bob meets and marries a woman in Italy, and they had a son who's already old enough to walk, talk, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">wield a knife</a>.
</li><li> Bart's love interest (through arranged hillbilly marriage), Mary Spuckler, runs off to New York between Seasons 19 and 24.

</li><li> Ling Bouvier has completely bypassed Maggie in age in the episode "Changing of the Guardian", with the ability to simultaneously play a flute, spin a lasso rope, do a floor routine, spin two hula hoops, and paint a portrait of her mother and aunt.
</li><li> When Manjula first appeared in a flashback in "Much Apu About Nothing", it was as a joke about a then-young-adult Apu having a young child as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">an arranged fiance</a>. When they actually get married in "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons", they were retconned to have both been children when first engaged.

What's particularly jarring is that Harriet isn't introduced until several seasons after the show's original premiere, but is later retconned as a preschooler into several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">recursive book adaptations</a> based on earlier installments of the TV show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Toshi's sister Akiko first appeared, she was distinctly pre-pubescent. The next time she showed up, she was at least the same age (if not older) as Steve and company.
</li><li> Greg and Terry's daughter Liberty was born through Francine as a surrogate in the season 3 episode "Surro-Gate"; in the season 8 episode "Spelling Bee My Baby" she is now about 3 or 4.

When Greg first met Rose Quartz, Amethyst still looked, acted, and was treated like a 7 year old (though her height is the same). <em>She's 6000 years old.</em> Presumably her interaction with Greg and/or Vidalia helped her mature a bit.
</li><li> The timeline of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a></em> is extremely woozy anyway, but Max has grown up from a kid in 1950s media, to a preteen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, to a teenager in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie">Goofy Movies</a></em> and finally a young adult in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em>. Ignoring that he should have aged way more, this is still ten years' worth of aging over a period where Huey, Dewey and Louie, or Morty and Ferdie, all consistently stayed the same twelvish age.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrZitbagsTransylvaniaPetShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrZitbagsTransylvaniaPetShop">Dr. Zitbag's Transylvania Pet Shop</a></em>, Officer Deadbeat's son Damian first appeared as an infant in the episode "Horrybaby". He becomes a prepubescent child in "Son of Zitbag" and is depicted as a teenager in "I Was a Teenage Zitbag". The latter also depicted the Exorsisters' nieces Listeria and Salmonella as being adolescents even though they were young girls in their debut episode "The Show Mustn't Go On".
