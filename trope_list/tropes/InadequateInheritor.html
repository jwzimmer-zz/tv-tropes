Once the King dies, he tries to cope with the responsibility via having his more capable brothers help him run the kingdom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He eventually chooses the male lead Kail as his successor, as he has no children of his own.

However, when she went to Artoria and revealed herself in hopes of being recognized as her heir and "son," Artoria rejected her. While Artoria refused her on the grounds that Mordred simply lacked both the temperament and experience to be a proper king, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">her own detachment from her emotions made her come off as incredibly callous in this</a>, and Mordred, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">who was already pretty insecure about her standing with Artoria even before this point due to her relationship with her mother</a>, ended up taking the whole thing to mean her father saw her as worthless and unworthy for being the unholy spawn of a witch, and thus the entire rebellion and Battle of Camlann happened.</span> Her goal in the present is to use the Grail to give herself the opportunity to prove her worth as an heir <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by drawing the Sword in the Stone.

</li><li> In a flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Hiashi states that he's disappointed with Hinata's performance and notes that the clan doesn't need a weak heir, but never goes so far as to openly disinherit her. This, however, is <em>before</em> Hinata <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, and the two have not been seen interacting in canon since, so fan works have several interpretations over whether Hinata lost her right to inherit the clan back then, and whether she would be considered worthy to inherit the Hyuga clan when the time came.
<ul><li> Post-timeskip, they are seen together as he observes her training in the clan fighting style to the point of exhaustion. No dialogue specific to the matter of inheritance is provided, but he seems to be more approving and proud of her determination despite being less naturally talented than Neji, the "genius" of the clan who was born to a branch family and can never inherit the clan. When facing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his resurrected twin brother</span>, who believes that his current state is punishment for trying to change his fate, he says that Hinata and Neji both fight to prove that destiny is not written in stone, indicating an acknowledgment of her efforts to change herself.
</li></ul></li><li> The fourth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a>: The Inner Chambers</em> kicked off because of this: Yoshimune's eldest daughter Ieshige was physically disabled, and especially compared to her younger sister Munetake, looked like this trope to the councilors, who feared Ieshige was also mentally disabled. Yoshimune, however, determined that Ieshige was of sound mind to inherit the shogunate. Munetake resented not getting the throne and it fueled the <em>fifth</em> succession crisis. Inverted, however, with Iesada: Ienari named her next in line after Ieyoshi because she was the only one of his children who <em>wasn't</em> inadequate.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> short story focused on a variation of this. Under insistence from her boyfriend Susumu, a woman named Nozomi pretends to be her dead best friend, Noriko, in order to claim an inheritance from Noriko's long dead grandmother. It helped that the last time Noriko's family saw her was when she was a little girl. Nozomi winds up receiving help from the grandmother's spirit, on the condition that the first thing she does with the money is provide a proper burial for Noriko (Nozomi was extremely offended that Susumu suggested such a ruse, but conceded because they have massive debts). Eventually, Nozomi learns that Noriko's mother had nearly been disowned by the family for eloping with a man, and only came back once when Noriko was a child to meet grandmother. It's implied that the grandmother didn't like the family any more than Noriko's mother did, as she made it clear that no one other than Noriko could touch the property registry. It's also implied that the family might have killed the grandmother themselves.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> anime, Gozaburo Kaiba was disappointed in his son Noah because he wasn't dedicated enough to be heir of his company, not to mention the fact that he was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">dead</a></em>. So instead he adopts an orphan and gives him some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to make him just such a ruthless manager as he himself is. Seto takes over his adopted father's company quite rapidly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">driving him to suicide</a>. Gozaburo considered downloading Noah's mind into Seto's body but decided against it because he believed Seto was more adequate than Noah to inherit. As a result of a boosted intelligence but little to no emotional maturity, Noah has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> and considers himself a god.
</li><li> Finral Roulacase from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> was originally the heir to the House of Vaude, a noble family with generations offensive Spatial Magic users and famed Magic Knights. But because of Finral's inability to use his magic offensively and being placed in the lowest-ranked squad the Black Bulls, he was disowned by his family in favor of his younger brother Langris.

He first crossed paths with Bruce Wayne because he thought he could convince Bruce to become his heir with the temptations of power (his empire) and love (his daughter Talia).
<ul><li> Another example is Damian Wayne. It's shown that, in the future, he will become Batman after he accidentally causes the death of Dick Grayson (the first long-term, accepted Batman successor). Bruce calls him out on this immediately, and Damian himself even admits that he can't measure up to Bruce or Dick, but will try anyway, because he promised to protect Gotham. And so he cheats, making a deal with the devil so that he cannot die, and even <em>then</em>, he is still inferior. Bruce sees a vision of this future and thus tells Damian that he can't ever become Batman.

<ul><li> Of course, when he so much as disappears for a few days they immediately descend into declaring open war on each other, so it's probably a justified view.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em>: whether or not Scrooge McDuck considers Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander to be this, thus leaving his fortune to the triplets Huey, Dewey and Louie instead, is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. Although the usual paradigm is that this is the case, as Donald is typically set up as too likely to squander it and Gladstone's luck-dependent laziness offends Scrooge, some stories instead present Donald as the heir, but one who desperately needs some training (at least in Scrooge's eyes).
<ul><li> The decision to have the triplets be Scrooge's heirs was made most prominently in the 1953 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> story "Some Heir over the Rainbow". Taking advantage of the legend of a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow, Scrooge made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>. In order to test his potential heirs' skills, he wanted to give one thousand dollars to each one of them without them knowing the money came from him. Using three rainbows and three pots, he managed to give one thousand dollars to Huey, Dewey and Louie; another thousand to Gladstone and the last one to Donald. Donald spent the money on a down payment for a new car; Gladstone saw no immediate need for the money so he decided to hide it somewhere; and Huey, Dewey and Louie used their money to help a man search for a treasure. Before Donald's nephews had a return from their investment, Scrooge would, despite considering an "awful injustice" to allow Gladstone to inherit his fortune, choose the lucky bastard over Donald for being the least likely to squander it.
</li><li> However, Donald was earlier declared Scrooge's heir in the 1949 story, "Race to the South Seas". And three years after "Some Heir Over The Rainbow", in 1956's "Two is Company", Donald and Gladstone were again competing for the position of Scrooge's heir. And in the 1961 story, "Bongo on the Congo", the whole plot is Scrooge considering Donald his heir and trying to make him better fitted for the role.
</li><li> Also, Donald's inadequacy is as writer-dependent thing; in several stories, such as "City of Golden Roofs" and "Crocodile Collector", whilst Scrooge still "wins out" at the end, Donald still displays considerable business savvy. For example, in "City of Golden Roofs", although Scrooge wins by receiving a huge golden nugget, the sizable amount of worked golden goods and sculpted jewels Donald earned would probably have a greater value than Scrooge's huge nugget. And in "Crocodile Collector", Donald allows Scrooge to swindle him out of the $10 thousand he was promised so that he can secretly claim the far larger treasure he discovered whilst searching for Scrooge's special crocodile.

Tyrion is the second son of Lord Tywin, but his older brother Jaime is a member of the Kingsguard, and therefore has forsworn his rights to inherit, which Tywin is furious at him for. Ironically, Tyrion is probably the <em>best</em> potential inheritor of Tywin's children, but Tywin's prejudice prevents him from seeing this.
</li><li> Cersei, being female, is ranked behind her two brothers. Nevertheless, she becomes the ruling Lady Lannister after her father dies and Tyrion is sentenced to death.

Lord Commander Selmy considers most of the others utterly unworthy; Jaime for breaking his oath and the rest for their lack of skill (in his early 60s, he claims to be capable of killing the five of them as easily as a dagger cuts through cheese, and they believe him). Things go downhill once he's kicked out. Jaime replaces him as commander, and tells one of the new guard that a member he had served with prior to the start of the series would have been able to cut through the six new members "with his left hand, while taking a piss with his right."

That fear led him to pray to every god he knew of for a solution, a prayer answered by the arrival of the first three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">Companions</a> and the quick adoption of a law requiring that the country's monarch must also be Chosen by a Companion in order to be eligible for the throne.
</li><li> Even with that, the trope is a subject of some concern in <em>Arrows of the Queen,</em> albeit to a lesser degree: Queen Selenay's daughter Elspeth is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> that her mother and the royal Court fear she won't be Chosen and a suitable Heir will have to be selected from among the other Heralds.

Lear ousts a dowerless Cordelia from the kingdom and the king of France marries her, while Lear divides his kingdom between Goneril and Regan, who treat him and his company of knights inhospitably, reducing the number to none, with Lear finding the stormy elements more hospitable than his harsh daughters. Old Gloucester, who himself has erroneously believed a forged letter by his bastard son Edmund that frames Edgar as conspiring against his father's estate, is blinded by Regan and Cornwall, and he joins Kent in rendering his services to Lear, while Cordelia goes out and nurses Lear back to health, before Edmund's forces capture them, with Goneril poisoning Regan before she commits suicide, and Lear reconciles with Cordelia before their deaths.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series, you typically have a Faction Leader and a Faction Heir.

Unfortunately, this may not always be the best person for the job. Some games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome</a></em>, allow you to manually change your Faction Heir at the cost of some influence to the former Heir in the form of the "Disinherited" trait.

<ul><li> This is <em>always</em> eventually the long run outcome in polygamous cultures. The patriarch will have a multitude of sons with different wives and concubines, so the question of inheritance eventually collapses into an all-out elimination game between the sons. The one who inherits from the patriarch won't be the best potential ruler, he'll be the best backstabber and intriguer. This dynamic caused the collapse of the Assyrian and Mongol empires, and contributed quite a bit to the Ottoman Empire's stagnation as the "sick man of Europe".
</li><li> JT, the crack gang leader made famous for letting grad student <a class="urllink" href="http://sudhirvenkatesh.org/">Sudhir Venkatesh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> stick around with his gang. Venkatesh writes about how, toward the end of his career, JT tried to rebuild his gang in new areas but was largely thwarted by prospective gangsters being more interested in whether they can get a new bicycle if they join the gang than in JT's dreams of power and wealth.
</li><li> Inverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi">Louis XIV</a> and his eventual successor Louis XV. On his deathbed, Louis XIV told his young great-grandson that he would be a great king, and warned him to avoid making war as much as possible, describing it as the "ruin of the people". Unfortunately, Louis XV ignored his great-grandfather's advice (possibly because he was only four at the time) and proved to be a woefully inept king before passing the throne to the more competent but weak willed Louis XVI, who proceeded to run France into the ground and lose his head in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>.
</li><li> Lenin wrote a document which would be known as "Lenin's Testament", where he criticized all potential successors to his leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including Stalin and Trotsky (He even suggested the former be removed from his post as General Secretary. The fact Stalin was rude to his wife didn't help). However, he wrote this as his health was beginning to fail; after his death, a power struggle ensued. Which was won by, ironically enough, Stalin.
</li><li> This has been the pattern for the majority of famous ancient leaders. Basically, the good leader gets power, has a lot of kids, establishes an elaborate court in which said kids spend all of their time squabbling and enjoying the facilities instead of governing. Examples of this include Yaroslav the Wise, Suleiman the Lawgiver, Akbar the Great, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Mansa Musa II, Asoka, Chandragupta II, Emperor Qin...</a>
</li><li> A built in feature of statistics. Anyone who is remembered for being great is likely to have a certain mix of genetic traits combined with a certain kind of character. Their offspring will be less likely to have such extremes built in. Their children have a high probability of being closer to average than the parent. Fortunately, it cuts both ways: a person of low character and talent should have children who tend to be closer to average. This is called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">a regression to the mean<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In short, Picasso's child is likely to be less talented than Picasso himself.
<ul><li> The Freakonomics podcast went into <a class="urllink" href="http://freakonomics.com/2011/08/03/new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-the-church-of-scionology/">several cases of this trope in the business world,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> such as Busch Beer's financial troubles until it was eventually sold. Investors and companies seem to overvalue the "family line." Japanese culture has a strong tendency for the father to be succeeded by his son in the family business, with some families having run a particular business for dozens of generations. The Japanese would often adopt individuals (in the past, almost always men) into their family just to avert this trope if the son didn't seem worthy.
<ul><li> This is still the case in the modern world. This has left Japan as the country with the highest adoption rates in the world, as well as the highest average age of the adopted (adoption is also used as a replacement for gay marriage, which is illegal in Japan, but that is neither here nor there).
</li></ul></li><li> To state the obvious, an observation that is true of populations is not true of particular individuals.
</li><li> For a while, the Roman Emperors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> this by hand-selecting and legally adopting an adult successor who had already showed the qualities the current emperor believed would make for a good successor. This worked pretty well for quite a while, until Marcus Aurelius (himself a well-regarded emperor) allowed his son Commodus to ascend to the throne. Things went <em>way</em> downhill after that.
<ul><li> The Julio-Claudians tended to adopt their successors from within their family, but there was no small amount of politicking within the family for the position. Notably Augustus exiled his only biological child, Julia, for, in his words, "whoring around Rome", while the trope namer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a> was selected as Tiberius's heir very narrowly. In a bit of an inversion, Claudius was planning to disinherit his stepson Nero in favor of his biological son, but Nero and his mother assassinated the both of them before it was made official.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms</a> period, Tao Qian recognized that his sons were incapable and that only Liu Bei (yes, the same Liu Bei that founded Shu) would have a chance of holding off Cao Cao; after his death, his advisors arranged for Liu Bei to succeed him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">toughest possible act to follow</a> for the US presidency, especially for the famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix">"obnoxious and disliked"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams">John Adams</a>, but Adams certainly didn't do himself any favors picking a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, the only other prominent member of his party.
