Instead of gold, jewels, or something else that has practical or monetary value, it turns out to be something else entirely.
</p><p>There are five main variants to this trope:
</p><ol><li> The thing that the character thought would contain a treasure turns out empty. Either the characters were misled and there never was a treasure to begin with, or the treasure used to be there but is long gone. Or worse yet, time and/or the environment destroyed the treasure and all that is left is its scraps.
</li><li> The treasure turns out to be something that has only sentimental, intellectual, spiritual, or philosophical value to those that originally owned or created the treasure. If the villain and the hero are competing for the same treasure, the villain will almost certainly fail to appreciate the value of the treasure, while the hero may in fact find something worthwhile in the treasure.
</li><li> The treasure may have held value at the time, but for one reason or another it is obsolete by the time it is dug up. The most common variant of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Confederate money</a>, which has its own section below, but it can also apply to vouchers for businesses that no longer exist anymore, metals that were precious at the time but are common today, and so on.
</li><li> The character assumes the treasure is worthless after getting it and tries to actively invoke this Trope and its positive values (even if it's a lie). Then it turns out that the treasure <em>had</em> worth (just not one immediately apparent to anybody involved in getting it) and the character sees his life demolished in the ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Springtime for Hitler</a>. Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subverted</a> when whatever forces demolished his life go too far and perform an action that renders the treasure actually worthless.
</li><li> The treasure is bait for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, so it's impossible to take it and stay alive afterwards (of course, sometimes the treasure is worthless even then, for the sake of a final "screw you" by the trap's maker). Occasionally there is no treasure at all, and the rumor of its existence <em>is</em> the bait (even having been released by whoever made the trap).
<ol><li> The treasure (or "treasure") is the seal of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>. Whoever takes it doesn't gets to enjoy it at all (if they are not going all "why would someone go through all the trouble to hide this thing?") because they become the first (and sometimes only) casualties to the Evil breaking loose.
</li></ol></li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If the treasure is mainly just the incentive for competition between the hero and the rival (see: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>), then the reveal of its worthlessness makes it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MockGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MockGuffin">MockGuffin</a>, and can also result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMacGuffinNoWinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMacGuffinNoWinner">No MacGuffin, No Winner</a>. Might involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters">All That Glitters</a>, if the object appears to be valuable but is really worthless. If it has sentimental value to a particular character, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime">#1 Dime</a>. If the characters find something valuable but discard it to ignorance, stupidity or possibly not being from Earth, it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>. If the worthless treasure is an edible, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdibleTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdibleTreasure">Edible Treasure</a>.
</p><p>A common resolution to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsInsidePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsInsidePlot">"What's Inside?" Plot</a>. Related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>, for obvious reasons. But if the characters gained more from the experience of looking for the treasure than they do from the value of the treasure they end up with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheJourneyThatCounts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheJourneyThatCounts">It's the Journey That Counts</a>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">Magic Feather</a> for cases where the heroes only <em>think</em> they need the treasure, but in fact they had its power all along.

A long-since-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">discredited example</a>, in the examples below <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Confederate money</a> is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">worthless and a waste of resources</a>. Of course, because of its historical value, preserved Confederate money is worth far more than US currency of the same denomination, with mint-condition $100 and $500 bills worth tens of thousands of US dollars. The real irony, of course, is that Confederate money is so valuable <em>now</em> because most of it was destroyed due to being considered worthless. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sdv0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0sdv0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sdv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While none of these examples mention what was done with the money, the perceived worthlessness would indicate the cash was either left behind or destroyed in some way. In reality, the currency was already technically worthless at the time of printing, as they were promissory notes (like American currency of the time, they were theoretically meant to represent a set amount of precious metal that would be given to the bearer on demand) with promised payment in precious metals being predicated on the Confederacy actually winning the war and being able to then pay back the note bearers. The notes even stated that they would not be valid for real specie until anywhere from six months to two years after a peace treaty was signed with the United States.</span>
<p>Somewhat similar to Confederate money is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>-era German POW Camp scrips. Under Geneva Conventions, a captor nation is required to pay its POWs at a rate equal to its own men (enlisted men had to subject themselves to forced labor to be paid... although not working wasn't really an option; officers were exempt from working). The catch is that POWs (at least those from Western countries) were paid in scrips that were good only at camp facilities, which offered nothing worthwhile for them to buy. Most threw away these scrips, but authentic World War II German camp scrips are now worth hundreds or thousands of dollars.
</p><p></p><ul><li> The old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators">The Three Investigators</a></em> children's novels contained an example that lacked a clear moral: a sunken riverboat holding a watertight chest that contains millions of dollars in Confederate money. It may have been worthless when the book was written, but...
</li><li> An episode of the George Reeves <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a></em> centered around an old man trying to keep his loot safe from robbers. Turns out to be Confederate money, considered worthless in the 1950s.
</li><li> In the "Mayberry Goes Bankrupt" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow">The Andy Griffith Show</a></em>, Andy is about to evict Frank Myers from his house, until he finds a 100-year old bond worth many thousands of dollars including accumulated interest, which is potentially worth more than Mayberry has in its treasury. Later on, Andy and Barney discover that the bond was signed during the Civil War, which makes the bond worthless, since the payout would have been made in Confederate dollars.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a>, Where Are You!</em> episode "A Night of Fright Is No Delight" (January 10, 1970), the money Scooby inherits turns out to be Confederate currency. When the chest containing the money is opened, the characters' reactions are those of disappointment.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MASK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MASK">M.A.S.K.</a></em> episode "Patchwork Puzzle" (December 11, 1985), the villains are after a large cache of money hidden during the Civil War (specifically, around the Washington Monument)...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">and of course they never expect it to be Confederate cash</a>. By this point, the <em>actual</em> value of Confederate money was becoming more obvious, so VENOM was just dumb.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> once found a treasure map that led to a lost fortune. This was one of the few times Boss Hogg managed to come out on top, only to discover the fortune was Confederate money. (The real treasure was the payroll document signed by General Lee.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>: The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittleHouseOnThePrairieS4E18TheInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittleHouseOnThePrairieS4E18TheInheritance">The Inheritance</a>" saw the Ingalls inherit a distant relative's fortune  in Confederate money. The plot twist came when they had already run up a huge line of credit at the Mercantile purchasing new farm equipment, seeds, etc. with a promise to pay.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> movie has a variation. (Possibly an inversion.) When Guile and his men raid Bison's fortress, Dee Jay basically says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere">Screw This, I'm Out of Here!</a> and runs off with a large suitcase. He runs into Sagat who cracks open the suitcase and discovers it's full of the money that was to be the currency for Bison's new government.
</li><li> In one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan">McAuslan</a> stories, a British army unit in post-WW2 Libya catch the local villagers sneaking into their fort to dig up a trunkful of Italian money, apparently unaware it's now worthless after the defeat of Fascist Italy. When the locals steal it back, no-one bothers to do anything about it.
</li><li> In Bordan Deal's story "The Big Bajoor" and the movie based on it gypsy fortuneteller Vanya swindles an elderly woman out of the fortune left to her by her late father. Vanya's abusive husband Sandor burns the money when they discover that it's Confederate and she taunts him about it after finding an accompanying book which lists exactly how much it was worth in then-modern US dollars.
</li><li> British TV series "When The Boat Comes In"; Russian sailor Kaganovich comes to England to confront Jack Ford and to recover the money his father paid him to smuggle him out of revolutionary Russia; Ford hands over every penny, unspent; to reveal that Kaganovich Senior had paid him in money issued by Kerensky's Provisional Government, and which became worthless when Lenin's Bolshevik Government issued a new currency.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>. The trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">Recycled In Space</a> in the episode "Gold". Our heroes rob a shipment of gold being transferred from the planet Zerok to the Federation. The gold has had its atomic composition changed to prevent it being stolen, so they exchange this useless gold for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney">Briefcase Full of Money</a> in Zerok currency. <em>Then</em> they discover that Zerok has just joined the Federation, rendering the currency invalid, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> can just have the gold changed back to normal on Zerok.
</li><li> "There'll be Some Changes Made", a story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JourneyIntoMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JourneyIntoMystery">Journey into Mystery</a></em> #33 (1956) has a man who resents his Revolutionary War era ancestor for spending the family fortune, so creates a time machine that can kill the man before he has a chance to do so. As a result, a strongbox containing the money instantly appears on the table ... and it turns out to be Continental currency, which had collapsed in value by 1778.

It turns out to be the enemy's top tactician, General Gold, who died in an attack on the convoy. The pilot who made the attack (who had been missing for a day or two) had burned half of Gold's papers and used the other half as tissues, since he couldn't read them. The base commander bursts out laughing upon hearing this, since deciphering them could have ended the war.

The treasure it selects is not revealed until Sakura breaks through the shield and captures the card, and turns out to be of purely sentimental value <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a bouquet of flowers in memory of Sakura's late mother, treasured by her cousin aka Tomoyo's mom</span>.
<ul><li> In this same episode is a similar example, revealing Tomoyo's most prized possession. Tomoyo is filthy rich, has her own bodyguards, cool high-tech toys, and a seemingly limitless budget to dress up Sakura in cute costumes and film her. Her most prized possession is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a child's eraser, in the shape of a bunny rabbit, worth maybe ten yen, given to her by her best friend Sakura on the day they met and lovingly cherished for years afterwards</span>.

On Conan revealing this, the villain had a complete breakdown over all they had done to find it - including mass murder and disfiguring their own face.
</li><li> Professor Agasa set up a treasure hunting trip for the kids, but once they followed the clues to the treasure, they're shocked to find that the toys were ruined; Conan eventually deduces that a robber was trying to find counterfeit printing plates, all while discovering and decoding the clues to where said plates were hidden.
</li><li> Shinichi, as a young boy, met the elder Kaitou Kid (the current Kaitou Kid's father) who gave him a clue that sent him on a puzzle-solving trip with Ran, but Shinichi misinterpreted the last clue so he thought the reward was the trip and the view of the sunset; upon revisiting the case as Conan, he realized the proper solution was to tear open the leather wallet holding the very first clue, upon which the message was revealed: "?" (Kaitou the elder was banking on Shinichi to go crying to his father Yusaku to solve the question, as the message—"Will you be able to stop me?"—was intended for said father; at some point Yusaku must have seen the message, because he tasked Yukiko with sending the reply—"!"—"Of course!")

</li><li> Double Subverted in "Big Adventure in the Eccentric Mansion". The treasure—a big honking diamond—is very real, but removing it from its place causes the nearby spring to overflow and flood the entire area. Only putting it back allows the group to leave safely.
</li><li> In the anime-only "Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour", the treasure turns out to be a letter talking about the ideals of the Meiji Restoration. Of course, the villains that are also trying to get what they think will be find a treasure rich enough to buy the whole country are not impressed. This is somewhat subverted when it is revealed that the letter had a rare and valuable stamp with a printing error on it that would have been worth a lot if the villain had not torn it up.
</li><li> Another filler story featuring a criminal attempting to drain Osaka castle to find what he believes is treasure, before Conan and Heiji come across him, reveal that the letter claiming that treasure lies there is a forgery written in hopes of weakening the castle's defenses, and thwart his plans. (The letter itself does have archaeological value, as it was most likely written near the end of the Sengoku period, but considering the criminal illegally trespassed into a historical location and kidnapped Kazuha, he won't be able to capitalize on it.)

Two halves of a scroll that was long ago cut in half are reunited to reveal a precious secret — which turns out to be a pickle recipe.

</li><li> In "the Treasury of Croesus", Scrooge discovers King Croesus' money bin. Inside is a chamber where Croesus kept his 'greatest treasure'. Upon opening it, he finds that the 'greatest treasure' is the very first coin Croesus, inventor of money, literally made. Scrooge was less than amused, particularly because he gave up the rest of the bin's contents for the right to it. The coin isn't literally worthless of course, but worth far less than what he just gave up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2kig6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2kig6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2kig6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's somewhat surprising that Scrooge wasn't expecting this, considering the worth that he himself attaches to his "Number One Dime."</span>

</li><li> One Danish story had a similar twist, where the treasure turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tons and tons of salt — which of course was used for money back in ye olden days</span>.
</li><li> Another Carl Barks story revolves around Scrooge buying up all the 1916-issued U.S quarters, then dumping all except one in the Mariana Trench so his sole remaining coin would become incredibly valuable. After his coin is accidentally destroyed, he goes diving for a new one, only to discover that the area he dumped the coins in is the hiding place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, hidden away from the rest of the world by the almost insurmountable depth. After a long adventure, Scrooge and his nephews manages to escape with a few coins, only for Scrooge to find out back on land that the coins he have are now so rare that the only person that can afford to buy them is <em>himself</em>, making the treasure both incredibly valuable AND effectively worthless.
</li><li> Scrooge drags Gladstone along on an adventure to find the hidden treasure of a princess. It turns out to be her childhood toys. Strangely enough, while Scrooge is understandably miffed by this turn of events, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Gladstone</a> finds it so heartwarming that he's moved to tears.
</li><li> And, of course, there's the fact that Scrooge McDuck's own greatest treasure is the first dime he ever made, an item with very little intrinsic value, but it's representative of Scrooge's hard work. The fact that it's owned by the richest duck alive is the reason why Magica DeSpell constantly seeks to steal it, because it allegedly would grant great totemic power to a spell that would make her rich... however, various of her schemes to get it (such as going back in time and taking it from Scrooge when he was a defenseless kid or allying herself with the Beagle Boys) have always made a significant (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">although temporary</a>) dent on Scrooge's monetary worth, nullifying whatever power she <em>could</em> have obtained from having it in her possession.

</li><li> "The Last Sled to Dawson" has the dogsled Scrooge lost to the ice during his Klondike days. When the ice begins to melt in the present story, Scrooge and Soapy Slick race to claim it. Soapy hopes it contains some gold at least, or at best the deed to Killmotor Hill, where the Money Bin is.

</li></ul></li><li> Back when <em>3-2-1 Contact</em> published a magazine in conjunction with their series, they ran a comic art serial titled "Cosmic Crew", which managed to do this trope both ways. After obtaining the final piece of their treasure on earth, the crew received a message about the importance of knowledge... which also added that they had been left some scholarship money.

</li><li> One of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a></em> comic books plays with the trope. Richie puts something he feels is valuable in a safe while <em>explaining to his dog</em> that valuables should be kept somewhere safe. So Dollar the dog has the bright idea of digging up his favorite bone and replacing Richie's treasure in the safe with his own. Later, robbers crack the safe...and find the bone. They assume it's a valuable fossil. Their boss disabuses them of the notion ("It's a two-day old soup bone") by abusing them. Back at the Rich mansion, Dollar is heartbroken...until Richie's dad has the butler toss a few soup bones at him.

The Freedom Fighters find a treasure map belonging to Uncle Chuck, but aren't impressed — since Robotnik conquered Mobius, money has no value. Sonic suggests that the treasure might be an invention Chuck made that could help in the resistance, so they go anyway. Robotnik hears about the hunt, and at the end of the story, gets away with the treasure. However, Sonic isn't too upset, having at that moment remembered what the treasure is, and how sentimental Uncle Chuck was. Robotnik was not amused.

This is another case where, while the treasure isn't what was expected, it still isn't worthless if you actually do some research and try to find the right buyer. Memorabilia from a historical figure as prolific and infamous as Hitler could be worth obscene amounts of money; in the real world, surviving paintings by Hitler sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars despite the fact that he was considered an average artist at best.

</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> story, Spider-Man has a rematch with the burglar who murdered Uncle Ben years ago, in the same townhouse where the Parker family lived at the time. It turns out the reason the burglar robbed the house in the first place was because he had heard that the house was once occupied by a retired gangster who had left a box full of documents in the attic detailing the location of his fortune. After the burglar is taken care of (he dies of fright when Spider-Man reveals his identity to him), Peter asks Aunt May about the box. She says that she and Ben had thrown the box out years earlier, as silverfish had destroyed the contents.

In the end, it turns out the uncle was broke and had nothing to leave his nephews — and so he devised the trials, so that the inheritance would be the accomplishments, adventures and life lessons the two men achieved while undergoing the trials.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a></em> comic, Woody, his niece, and his nephew run out of gas and seek help at the nearby Red Diamond Mine. Unfortunately, two men are in the process of holding up the place. Woody and the kids are forced to help the robbers and Woody tricks them into letting him overload their helicopter with the diamonds. After the helicopter crashes into the nearby pond, Woody offers to help the prospector recover the diamonds from the helicopter. The prospector reveals it's actually a salt mine and his name is Red Diamond.

One comic book has a story involving a bunch of criminals who plan to kill the Phantom and the pygmies and steal the treasure. The plan involves one of the criminals pretending to be lost in the jungle and being taken in by the Phantom. At one point, he asks if he can see the treasure and when it is shown, he thinks it is complete junk since there is a rusty sword, an old horn, a dusty snake in a bottle, and other items like that. He was looking at Excalibur, the Horn of Roland, the mummified remains of the asp used by Cleopatra to kill herself, and other such priceless antiques. What makes this even funnier is that the Phantom actually introduces every single item in detail as he brings it out and the criminal still doesn't realise their worth. Later on, after his associates are captured and shown the treasure as a courtesy, they realise just how much it was worth. Then the Phantom further reveals that this was his major treasure room and shows them his <em>minor</em> treasure room which is actually full of the gold and jewels and gems that they thought they would find.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail">Holy Grail</a> is real enough treasure, but it can't be brought out of its resting place without bringing the whole place down around it. Indy's father realizes, at the end, that the real treasure he gained out of the whole mess was, in his words "Illumination" (and, unspoken, the reconciliation of his relationship with Indy). Plus, now that they know where it is, it becomes more important to escape alive so that they can return to set up a proper dig site and recover it.
</li><li> Used straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em>.

</li><li> Comes up in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones">Young Indiana Jones</a></em> movie, <em>The Treasure of the Peacock's Eye</em>. Indy and Remy spend the entire film hunting for the titular diamond. After numerous double-crosses (including once by Indy's love interest, who is promptly murdered by yet <em>another</em> searcher) and escapes they finally arrive at the treasure... only to find it gone and a plain, worthless stone in its place. Remy is understandably furious because of how costly the search has been for all parties. The stone itself, however, is hinted to be another clue as to the diamond's whereabouts, and Remy becomes obsessed with tracking it down while Indy gives up and returns home to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a> we know and love.

So Indy <em>does</em> manage to acquire it after all... for all of a few minutes before it's lost in the scuffle while trying to escape Lao Che's club.
</li><li> Overall, the movies tend to zigzag the trope a bit; in each of them, there actually is a treasure, it <em>is</em> valuable... but it's valuable in a way that is either inconceivably dangerous (usually of the face-melting variety) or which makes it more-or-less inaccessible, meaning that Indy usually doesn't end up with it. However, the ending of the films nevertheless makes it clear that while Indy doesn't get to walk away with the treasure, he does come away with some kind of deeper understanding or valuable relationship which compensates for it.

He's thrown when they respond they already knew that but aren't sure why Feathersmith is so happy as the oil is a mile underground. Too late, Feathersmith realizes that in 1910, the technology to drill that deep won't be invented for nearly 30 years and thus he's spent nearly all his money on land that is, basically, worthless.
<ul><li> Feathersmith could have held onto the land but his impatient nature refuses to let him wait so long.

The team finds the sword, the villain picks it up...and then they declare that it's "just a sword", never mind that it survived for centuries, is linked to multiple world-changing events, and is CLEARLY GLOWING when they find it.

In it there is a treasure trove of items that his father had bought over the course of his career as a businessman. Big Daddy discusses the value of these items, then goes on to say how his overall business empire is worth over 10 million dollars, and how he plans to one day turn it all over to his family to control. Brick, outraged at Big Daddy's love of personal wealth, destroys a great deal of these items to show it means nothing to him and that he only wanted his father's love. Big Daddy tells his son that he does love him and that he would do anything for him or give him anything he ever wanted; the reason he is giving all these things away is because he grew up in humble origins where his father was poor and all he ever left him before he died was a useless uniform from his time served in the Spanish-American War and that he will leave behind a more valuable legacy than his father left him. Brick argues that Big Daddy's father left him more than just an old uniform, he left behind many happy memories and love for his son and that maybe the reason he died laughing was because he was happy that he had his son by his side. The realization that the true gift he needed to leave behind for his family was love— and that he didn't resent his father for leaving behind nothing of value, since love was something that he always had— reduces Big Daddy to tears.

After he finds it, he leaves triumphant—and a few of the natives who kept it safe remark that it was actually the king's backscratcher, hinting at this trope. The subversion is that the relic is still extremely valuable regardless of its original function, so it doesn't really matter what the king did with it—it's still a jeweled antique worth millions.

In the Imperial City, word gets out that the proprietor of the Bloated Float, an inn run out of a boat in the harbor, has hidden a solid-gold model of a ship called the "Golden Galleon" somewhere aboard. Upon sleeping at the inn, the player character awakens to discover that a gang of bloodthirsty pirates has commandeered the boat to find the treasure. After defeating the pirates, the player has the option of sparing their leader, who offers up her one-of-a-kind sword in exchange for mercy (the player can also kill her and take the sword, but she's very difficult to beat, especially at a low level, which is likely when this quest will occur unless you know about it). The owner of the ship then reveals that there never was a Golden Galleon to begin with—he made up the story to attract customers, only to end up nearly murdered for his trouble. Despite the lack of a "real" treasure, though, the player does receive a sizeable amount of gold and the special sword, so it's certainly worthwhile to complete the quest.

Turns out the prize wasn't a jawbreaker (and Double D never said it was); it was a diploma from the kids' school, which Double D considered more valuable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Cue an annoyed Rolf pelting Double D with beets</a>.
</li><li> The episode "O-Ed Eleven" had the Eds finding a treasure map in Eddy's Brother's former room and plotting to retrieve the treasure from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Kanker Sisters'</a> mobile home. In the end, all the map leads to is a suitcase full of wishbones.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EllaTheElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EllaTheElephant">Ella the Elephant</a></em>, the treasure of "Treasure Hunters" is a note about friendship being the greatest treasure of all, signed by the kids' parents. Belinda's <em>really</em> annoyed at first, but then they all agree that it's a great treasure.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has Peter discover that a placemat at a local restaurant, supposedly based on a real treasure map, actually does correspond to real clues, and ends up drawing the whole town into a mad hunt for the treasure, which eventually fizzles out. Peter and Lois eventually realize that the treasure is hidden at the Drunken Clam, the oldest pub in Quahog, and find a small chest hidden behind a photo... only for the "treasure" to turn out to be a promotional stunt by the restaurant from the opening, and on top of that, it was a coupon for a free meal that expired in 2006.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin">Franklin and Friends</a></em> special <em>Polar Explorer</em> features Great Aunt Harriet's special treasure in the Antarctic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which turns out to be an extremely sparkly and picturesque lake that discovered.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied when a space pirate's ship has been shot and is spinning out of control; before it blows up the captain is seen morosely looking out a port window and saying "Too late do I realize that me children are me only real treasures".
</li><li> Also suggested by one of the monks trying to find God by looking through a telescope (in the same episode, oddly enough). "Maybe the love that this 'Fry' feels for his friend is God." "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Oh, how convenient!</a> An explanation for God that doesn't involve looking through a giant telescope. Get back to work!"
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GadgetBoyAndHeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GadgetBoyAndHeather">Gadget Boy &amp; Heather</a></em> has Spydra stealing the "most priceless treasure in the desert" that an emir planned to give to his son. It turned out to be a bottle of water, which would have been a valuable lesson for the boy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> featured the hunt for Merlin's journals... which proved to be ordinary journals, not deep, dark mystic secrets. MacBeth is disappointed to find no powerful spells, but the Gargoyles — particularly the ones that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">had just learned the advantages of learning to read</a> — understood their historical value. MacBeth, of course, subverts his role as the villain: He understands their value too (and in fact, already has a copy), and lets the Gargoyles leave with them once he learns they don't have any spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, "Slightly Dinghy." Max wanted to get a quarter to buy a new video game, and after failing to find one in the couch, he talks PJ into asking Pete to take them fishing to find the treasure of the lake. The lake treasure turns out to be worth "less than nothing" in the words of a local reporter. Max is not harmed by this, because Goofy already found a quarter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">(which the audience was already aware of)</a>. PJ, who didn't want to come in the first place, however, had to faint.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHairBearBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHairBearBunch">Help!...It's The Hair Bear Bunch</a></em> episode "Gobs of Gabaloons" has the eponymous three bears palm off on zookeeper Peevly a supposed treasure map, which turns out to reveal the location of a horde of gold coins. Unfortunately for Peevly, the coins are Ptomainian Gabaloons, which due to a treaty between America and Ptomania cannot be spent in the USA and must be returned to Ptomania, unspent, but Peevly doesn't discover this before running up a huge debt against the treasure. He comes badly unstuck when the Ptomanian ambassador arrives expecting to collect it.
</li><li> In "Big Bug Island" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakeAndTheNeverlandPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakeAndTheNeverlandPirates">Jake And The Neverland Pirates</a></em>, Captain Hook is thrilled at the idea of a golden caterpillar that will lead him to treasure and even agrees to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with the protagonists of the show to find it. The treasure turns out to be the joy of seeing the golden butterfly, which delights Jake, his team, and Hook's minions, but aggravates Hook.
</li><li> Played straight in "The Treasure Hunt" episode of of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>. Jem's "Starlight Girls" face off with Pizzazz's "Misfit" girls over a treasure at the end of a rich man's contest. The prize turns out to be books, much to Pizzazz's dismay. These were rare, leather bound, first editions that any serious book collector would kill for - but the only serious collector in this universe was the rich man that held the contest.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JuliusJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JuliusJr">Julius Jr.</a></em> episode <em>Clancy, Be Careful</em>, the gang helps Diamondbeard find treasure from a map he's found. It turns out that the treasure was all the stuff that belonged to him when he was a baby, because the treasure was his <em>mom's treasure</em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012">Littlest Pet Shop (2012)</a></em> episode "The Treasure of Henrietta Twombly", a greedy treasure hunter hears a rumor that Mrs. Twombly's ancestor had buried treasure, then practically tears the pet shop apart trying to find it. When the treasure chest is finally found, it contains pet kibble, since Henrietta loved animals. Disappointed that there were no gold or jewels, the treasure hunter leaves. Blythe digs through the kibble and finds a book containing Henrietta's secret pet food recipes, thought to have been lost to history. Blythe and Mrs. Twombly realize they could probably make a pretty profit with it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short "The Million Hare" subverts this big time. Daffy and Bugs are the chosen contestants on a show called "Beat Your Buddy," with a million bucks up for grabs. Daffy wins but discovers the host says the prize is "a million box," with one million little boxes inside. Daffy forfeits the prize to Bugs and is then told that inside each of the boxes was a $1 bill. Cue Daffy's face turning into a hee-hawing jackass.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">My Little Pony 'n Friends</a></em> episode "The Magic Coins", after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">their ill-thought out wishes</a> made on the coins cause trouble, the ponies turn to the coins' crotchety creator, Niblick the troll, for help. Niblick refuses to help unless they bring him a treasure of equal or greater value than that of the coins. The ponies risk their necks to bring him three treasures, but Niblick rejects them all. Just as things look hopeless, Megan thinks to use the last of the coins to wish for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">a friend for Niblick</a>, and despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple">Odd Couple</a> dynamic between the two, they hit it off and Niblick agrees to help.
</li><li> In one animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> special, "You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown", Charlie Brown ends up competing in a motocross race with the promise of Pro Bowl tickets as the grand prize. Charlie Brown, much to the surprise of everyone, ends up winning, but in true Peanuts fashion, they couldn't get the Pro Bowl tickets so they tried to compensate by giving him a gift certificate for five free haircuts. The problem? His dad is a barber, plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlieBrownBaldness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlieBrownBaldness">he doesn't have that much hair to cut anyway.</a>
</li><li> King Julien anticipates this trope on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> after hearing about a treasure. "This is real treasure, right? Not one of those 'friendship is the greatest treasure of all' deals? Because you can't trade friendship for, you know, the goods and the services."
</li><li> Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "The Ballad of Badbeard", where Phineas, Ferb and their friends try to find the treasure of Badbeard the pirate, and eventually end up lost in a cave. Oh, and the actual treasure? Fake beards.
<div class="indent"><strong>Baljeet:</strong> Perhaps the real treasure is true friendship, and the spirit of adventure. <br/><em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>)</em> <br/><strong>Phineas:</strong> Nah, there it is over there. <em>(points to a door with a big red "X" on it)</em> X marks the spot!
</div></li><li> Seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>, when "the treasure of Third Street School" turns out to be a collection of beloved toys left behind by former students (one of whom happens to be the principal of their school). However, it's not <em>quite</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> as it sounds on the surface — the hiders of the treasure were, at the time, children themselves, who really <em>would</em> find such things precious, and really <em>would</em> be likely to play an elaborate game by "hiding" it as though it were treasure. (Who didn't do similar things as a child?)
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a></em> did a subversion of this, where escaping a trap required discovering the 'real' treasure, knowledge. The trick was, there actually <em>were</em> piles of gold and jewels waiting for whoever solved the puzzle, and the main characters happened to miss the reveal — a one-off gag character came in time to grab it, though.
</li><li> Used in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> spoof in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>, in which "Pasadena Jones" (Buster) had gone through all the usual Indy adventures to get to a treasure chest purportedly containing "the Secret of Life", which turned out to contain Babs, Plucky and Hamton - the secret of life is friendship. He wasn't impressed: "In the sequel, I'm going after some gold."
</li><li> The "Rue Britannia" story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> had Bullwinkle an heir to the Earl of Crankcase fortune, a million pound note, which is coveted by the Earl's evil nephews. Through a physical technicality, Bullwinkle is disqualified and the nephews are awarded the note. The catch: it's an I.O.U. note that the nephews are forced to work off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewScoobyAndScrappyDooShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewScoobyAndScrappyDooShow">The New Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo Show</a></em> episode "Wedding Bell Boos!", the lost Indian treasure hidden by Shaggy's piligrim ancestor McBaggy Rogers turns out to be corn. It was indeed valuable for the piligrims to survive - but not for their modern-day descendants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spoofed in "Bart to the Future". Marge and Homer go out to hunt for Abraham Lincoln's Gold. They eventually find a chest and inside it is a sheet of paper saying "my gold is in the heart of every American". Marge thinks it's sweet. Homer angrily curses out "That lousy! Rail-splitting! Freak!".
</li><li> Also subverted in another episode. Homer, as a vigilante leader, has caught a notorious cat burglar. The burglar reveals that he has a treasure hidden, and the entire town rushes off to solve his riddle and dig it up. When they find it, there is only a note inside, revealing that it was a ruse to distract everyone while the burglar escaped from prison.
<ul><li> In true Springfield fashion, they refuse to believe the note and keep digging until the hole is too big to climb out.
</li><li> "Dig <em>UP</em> stupid!"
</li></ul></li><li> When Homer and Mr. Burns are in the cabin buried by an avalanche, Carl suggests that maybe "the cabin" they were supposed to find was that special place in their hearts that they go to when they work together. Lenny accepts it, but then gets disappointed because Burns said there would be sandwiches in the cabin.
</li><li> At the start of "Homer's Phobia" Marge decides to sell her grandmother's antique Civil War statue in order to pay for a new dryer. However, when she gets to the store, the owner reveals that it's a liquor bottle from the 1970s; Marge sighs and says it'll be a monument to Grandma's secret drinking problem.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> features the main characters being stuck in a cave together because they felt sorry for Al Gore (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>). Cartman finds what he thinks is treasure, and proceeds to <em>eat it</em> so he can move it out of the cave once they're rescued without having to tell the others. Unfortunately for Cartman, the treasure was fake gold as a part of a tourist exhibit, meaning he put himself through horrible pain for plastic that's only worth about 18 dollars.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy">Squirrel Boy</a></em> had an episode where Andy and Rodney learn of a treasure placed under their front yard by the company that makes Puffy Pirate Shirt Puffs. Turns out the "treasure" is a marketing gimmick; it's just a chest containing the company mascot and a lifetime supply of the cereal. To make matters worse, they had to tear up Andy's dad's prize lawn to get it.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Rodney</strong>: Hey, what gives? Where's the treasure? <br/><strong>Cap'n Puffy</strong>: I dunno, man. They just threw me in a box with a bunch of cereal.

When he finally opened it, all it contained were a couple of glass bottles and a piece of scrap paper. It wasn't even an open space that might at one time have held a treasure that had already been removed); the "vault" was part of the foundation of a building Capone had owned, so it was just concrete surrounding fill dirt with a bit of garbage mixed in.
