It's not rocket science.
</p><p>Forbidden Fruit is a person, place, or thing absolutely irresistible to one or more characters, whose appeal lies solely in the fact it has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">forbidden, prohibited, and declared unquestionably off limits</a>. They feel they must have it only because they know they can't or shouldn't have it. Frequently takes the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox">Pandora's Box</a> they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">not to open</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">Big Red Button</a> they are not to press, an experiment they are not to mess with, a person they are not allowed to be with, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">even hear about</a>, a potion they are not to taste under any circumstances, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenZone">a place nobody is supposed to ever visit</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Can be a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness">Genre Blindness</a>, but not usually, since the attraction of Forbidden Fruit is in and of itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">contrary to logic</a>. More often than not, the characters <em>know</em> that going for it would be a stupid move; they just can't help themselves. (They are particularly likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouthIsWastedOnTheDumb">to be young</a>.)
</p><p>Needless to say, opening the forbidden door or acquiring the Forbidden Fruit leads to disaster 99.9% of the time. Used often in setting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobyTrap">Booby Traps</a>, where it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>, when a villain intentionally takes advantage of the power of Forbidden Fruit to lure heroes to their doom. (Unless, of course, he is redeemed by the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/HostessFruitPies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/HostessFruitPies">delicious fruit pies</a>.)
</p><p>The trope takes its name from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEden">Garden of Eden</a> story in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>, where Eve is tempted into eating the Forbidden Fruit (an apple, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>), making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. (It is also theorized that the "forbidden fruit" of Genesis was actually a fig or a pomegranate, the forbidden Underworld food that did in Persephone, but that's another tale.) Because of this, see also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple">Tempting Apple</a>, when an apple is used to symbolize temptation, though not necessarily because it is forbidden.

As he goes to open the box, Kururu even remarks "That just makes me want to open it even more."

Mai and her friends are warned ahead of time by Shiho's grandfather never to open it, out of fear of unleashing a great evil.

When she wanted to go to the town near their house, Shaorin told her absolutely no, because the wolves were near it. Shaorin later goes to town herself, leaving the girl all alone. The instant Shaorin leaves, the little girl leaves as well. This leads to the girl being fatally injured by the wolves and dying in Shaorin's arms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a literal Forbidden Fruit from a tree in the backstory. During an era of war, a princess ate the fruit of the God Tree to gain its power to end the conflicts by force. Her son was born with similar powers, the Sage of the Six Paths.

It is later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Tree never reacted to the theft of the fruit. It was Princess Kaguya who became corrupted by her power, then, in anger of her sons inheriting it, absorbed the rest of the Tree and mutated into the Ten Tails in an attempt to overpower them and reclaim the power she felt was rightfully hers.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Implied with Boa Hancock. She's declared the "most beautiful woman in the world," and can mesmerize and have pretty much <em>any</em> man she wants. Guess who she ends up falling for? Luffy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Hero</a> who will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">absolutely never return her feelings</a>. It's even implied that she fell for him <em>because</em> he was "not like the others," with him calling her a "stupid lady" and telling her to shut up.
</li><li> In a more literal example, the Devil Fruits, which give the eaters superpowers but make them unable to swim, even taking away their buoyancy. And due to the fact that that world is mostly water, it's a heavy price to pay for anyone who would be a major part of the plot; pirates (and even Marines who combat them, and to some extent other people regardless of how they live) who eat it (including Luffy, the protagonist) are willingly risking their lives.
</li></ul></li><li> Arguably, any person who wants Sousuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">a lot of people</a>. Pretty much every one of them <em>knows</em> that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">near impossible</a> for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">ever return their feelings</a>. And although each one of them normally has another person who is in love with them, they can't seem to help but be drawn to the mysterious and unattainable Sousuke. It came as a huge shock to most characters that he started to have some reciprocating feelings towards Kaname - something even <em>she</em> didn't know or expect (as she herself even thought that having feelings for him is hopeless, but it's something she just can't help).
<ul><li> Especially noticeable with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Gauron</a>, who actually had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">two beautiful girls</a> who were desperately in love with him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">whose existence revolved around him</a>. Did he care? No. He just can't seem to forget that beautiful and emotionless boy he saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">once upon a time</a>, who currently hates him with a passion and loves to beat the shit out of him.
</li></ul></li><li> The chosen priestesses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> must be virgins and remain as such until they summon the deity that chose them and ask for three wishes.

Near the end of the long and frightening trip through, exhausted and low on supplies, they spot the wood elves' feasting off the path, and despite Thorin clearly remembering the warning, they decide to approach and beg for food. Unfortunately, true to Gandalf's warning, they get lost, are quickly ambushed by the Spiders, and even after escaping, the wood elves take them prisoner. (Not that being captured was a bad thing at this time.)
</li><li> A favorite device of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> in many of his short horror stories involves a character/narrator who is overcome by the urge to kill someone for no other reason than because he knows it is wrong and he shouldn't. He is aware of this psychology, he has no reason to give in to these urges, but it drives him crazy until he does. Poe's own term for this phenomenon is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imp_of_the_Perverse">"the Imp of the Perverse."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> Ironically, in the first book, there is a corridor that is designated as forbidden, which the characters only end up in by accident. Apparently, everyone else took Dumbledore's warning of a "most painful death" seriously. The same goes for the actually named <em>Forbidden Forest</em>, which the characters only wind up in because circumstances force them, and which most people avoid due to rumours of it being filled with horrible beasts (though the Weasley twins had apparently made attempts to enter it). However, the forest is entered again in nearly every book; Hagrid once held classes in there (though Hagrid is of the opinion that nothing in the forest would harm anyone with him because its denizens know him so well, and he seems to be right for the most part).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime">Thief of Time</a></em>, Susan wonders why someone would build a clock that stopped time and then realizes: "If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em> this is further lampshaded, as the wizards prop open a window to another dimension/time and hang a sign on it saying, "Do not touch the window, not even to see what would happen."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, the stone circle is specifically <em>not</em> forbidden territory because of this trope; the people who aren't forbidding it don't want people going there at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>, a shrewd vampire aristocrat turns out to have named his home "Don'tgonearthe Castle", in the happy knowledge that this will guarantee a steady supply of passing travelers to snack on.
</li><li> <em>The Unseen University Challenge</em> includes a passing mention of the not-entirely-complimentary nickname "Merkins" for Americans, with a footnote whose text is "do not look this word up in the dictionary" but the subtext is "the dictionary's over there, what are you waiting for?"

In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingApple">the hand holding an apple on the cover is a reference to this trope</a>.
</li><li> In many variants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a> <em>The Knight of the Swan</em>, the knight arrives to aid a lady, marries her or her daughter, but forbids anyone to ask what his name or origin is.

</div></li><li> Played absolutely straight in Book Ten of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em> with Aeolus's bag of winds. Aeolus was a king that Odysseus's party stopped to visit on the first year after winning the Trojan War. He entertains them well, and they stay for a month at his island, then say their goodbyes. To speed their journey, Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag made from the skin of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">nine-year-old ox</a>, and inside it is the North, South, and East winds. After ten days of smooth sailing that would probably set some records, they come within sight of Ithica. Odysseus goes to sleep after handling the bag for so long, and his companions, thinking there's gold from Aeolus in the bag, go to peek in it. The other winds burst out, and swept the ships away from their own country, eventually leading to everyone but Odysseus's death, and for him, his homecoming is delayed by nine years. Also a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> case, seeing as Aeolus never said any sort of warning not to tell the others what's in the bag (for example, it's not like if someone else knew that the enchantment would be broken), so it's baffling why in the world Odysseus didn't simply tell them as they left Aeolus's island and sate their curiosity early on. Probably because he figured then they'd open it to see what winds looked like. By sheer coincidence they were swept back to Aeolus' island. Aeolus refused to help them again, taking this incident as a sign that the gods didn't want Odysseus to return home anytime soon.
</li><li> Played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaCWrede">Patricia C. Wrede</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Dealing with Dragons</a></em>. After accidentally unleashing a djinn from an unlabeled bottle (that one character had been warned not to touch but the other <em>hadn't</em>) Cimorene thinks fast enough to recover the situation, seals the spirit in the bottle again, and then makes an "idiot-proof" label that explains exactly <em>why</em> it shouldn't be opened to prevent future mishaps. Oh, and the incident also furthers the plot.
</li><li> In "A POISON TREE" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongsOfExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongsOfExperience">Songs of Experience</a></em>, the narrator's foe covets and steals an apple in the knowledge it belongs to the narrator. Of course, it turns out to be poisonous.
</li><li> Played unusually literally in Christina Rossetti's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoblinMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoblinMarket">Goblin Market</a></em>, where magical fruit serves as a temptation to young women. Seeing as Lizzie gives Laura more of the fruit by letting the goblins press it to her lips and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">letting Lizzie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">kiss the juice off of her</a>, it's safe to say that the fruit is a metaphor for sex.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness">Song of the Lioness</a></em> book, Duke Roger invokes the hell out of this trope as his second kill-the-Crown-Prince plot when he tells Jon and the other pages how terribly dangerous the Black City is, so much so that even Roger wouldn't try messing with whatever's there. Predictably, Alanna soon catches Jon sneaking off.
</li><li> Deliberately invoked in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews">V. C. Andrews</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasteelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasteelSeries">Casteel</a></em> series: Heaven moves in with her grandmother and her grandmother's husband, Tony Tatterton. Tony allows her to live with them on several conditions, one of which is that she stay away from his brother Troy. Heaven ignores this, and she and Troy end up falling in love. When Tony finds out, he admits that he'd been hoping that might happen and that the reason he'd forbidden her to have any contact with Troy was that "the forbidden fruit is often the sweetest." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then this trope hits again, hard, when it's revealed that Tony is Heaven's real father, making Troy her uncle</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall">Wolf Hall</a></em> portrays Henry VIII's attraction to Anne Boleyn as having a lot of this trope in it. Between the Pope's refusal to annul his marriage to Katharine of Aragon and Anne's refusal to actually sleep with him out of wedlock, Henry is in a fever pitch to have her. Once they're actually <em>married</em>, his attraction to her cools (especially since they have bad luck getting a son despite her delivering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">healthy daughter</a> right away). He still has the satisfaction of spiting the Holy Roman Emperor, but Thomas Cromwell maneuvers the ambassador into acknowledging her and thus Henry finally wins that contest of wills; soon after he orders Cromwell to get rid of Anne. Henry's attraction to Jane Seymour follows much the same pattern—when she rebuffs his advances in a profession of modest chastity, it just makes him want her more.
</li><li> There was a short story that subverted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Biblical account</a>, in which Adam and Eve eat the fruit, are confronted by God, and openly admit to doing so: it's <em>their</em> garden now, and God <em>gave</em> them the wit to make choices for themselves, so why shouldn't they exercise it? If he wants unquestioning lackeys, God will just have to destroy them both and make some replacements. Seeing that this pair of humans would rather stand up for their principles than cower or lie, God embraces them both, pleased that he's <em>finally</em> gotten it right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingDaysOfAbbyHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingDaysOfAbbyHayes">The Amazing Days of Abby Hayes</a>,</em> Laurie follows an extremely strict diet, avoiding pretty much everything that isn't fresh, natural, or organic, which means that she eats practically nothing but nuts, crackers, and seeds. Sticking to her diet isn't a problem for <em>her</em>, but she also imposes it on her five-year-old daughter Wynter, who naturally takes every opportunity she sees to eat foods like hot dogs, ice cream, candy and chocolate behind her mother's back.

They only let kids know which TV shows were not recommended for them, and therefore, the shows that were totally awesome.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> lampshaded this in a 1997 strip with Jason flipping through the channels and continuing to change each time he came across something labeled TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and TV-PG, until he yells, "Is there nothing for a kid to watch when his parents aren't home?" Then he comes across a program rated TV-MA, and says, "Finally."
</li><li> Then in 1997, it seems the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> had clearly not learned their lesson and expanded on this mistake when they pushed for even more detailed content warnings. In addition to the rating of the show displayed in the upper corner, they had to have letters indicating the content of the show such as L for language, S for sexual situations, and V for violence. This only helped kids even further with identifying the shows they wanted to watch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a></em> lampshaded this with a story about the nation's teenage boys lobbying Congress to demand a more precise rating system with explanation such as how, if a teenage boy is to make an informed decision about whether a particular program is worth watching he needs to know exactly what it contains, and a boy complaining about how he sat through an entire program rated TV-MA that had no sex or violence.
</li><li> When the UK's Channel 4 launched in 1982, with a mandate for adventurous, push the envelope programming, it made a huge fuss of prefacing its late-night risque movies with a red warning triangle. This had the inevitable effect of attracting viewers rather than warning them off as the practice quickly became infamous. It was dropped not too long afterwards. But C4 retained its reputation for being slightly dangerous.

This is actually why a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">diets fail in real life</a>. It's not healthy to think of food (of any sort, unhealthy or not) as forbidden, or to think of occasionally eating the wrong food as "cheating" or "slipping up". That kind of thinking leads to people just plain giving up on dieting.

</li><li> The programme <em>Derren Brown: Trick or Treat</em> had fun with this.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> comes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> gives free rein to the first two humans over everything in the paradisal Garden of Eden, except for one tree, because eating of its fruits will cause them to die. Unfortunately, a wily serpent manages to tempt the two into eating the fruit out of their desire to be god-like, leading them to be expelled from the Garden and introduce humanity to pain and death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken">The exact species of fruit wasn't mentioned.</a> Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">Four Is Death</a>, it's portrayed as an apple because the Latin word for apple, malus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">also means "evil".</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Genesis 2:16-17</strong>: And the L<span class="font-s">ORD</span> God commanded the man, You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.
</div><ul><li> Additionally, the second tree in the center of the garden became the new forbidden fruit. The reason specifically mentioned in Genesis as to why Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden and security posted at the gates was to prevent them from eating fruit from the tree of life.
</li></ul></li><li> Pandora and the box she was told never to open. The Greek gods, who were huge bastards at the best of times, gave her the box, told her not to open it, then gave her a huge amount of curiosity, so that eventually she WOULD open the box. And this was to punish mankind for accepting Prometheus' gift of fire. She opened it, and the world has been suffering for it ever since, though surprisingly, there wasn't a large line of angry Greeks ready to kill her. Since they were the <em>first</em> evils, maybe the typical reaction was: "Hmm. I wonder what this i—OHMYGODAAAAAHHH!"
<ul><li> Some variations include that Hope was the one good thing to come out of the box, although in some versions she had to open the box a second time for it to come out. In another, "Foreboding" (the foretelling of one's ills, such that mankind would always dread the future) was the one demon that Pandora was able to keep in the box.
<ul><li> Other variations imply that Hope was the <em>worst</em> evil to come out, as it stops people from giving up when they really should.
</li><li> Yet <em>other</em> variations go with the logic of Hope being kept inside the box so that the other Evils wouldn't be able to kill it.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on which version you read, Pandora herself was created by the gods and given to Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus. Before he was imprisoned by the gods for giving fire to mortals, Prometheus warned his brother never to accept any gifts from the gods. However, Epimetheus became so enchanted with Pandora that he accepted her (and the box she was carrying) without worrying about his brother's warning.
<ul><li> Prometheus means "forethought" and Epimethus means "afterthought". Which explains why Epithemus is so dumb.
</li></ul></li><li> Note that in the original Greek, Pandora has a <em>pithos</em>, meaning "jar." It became a "box" due to a translation mistake during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a>. However, "Pandora's box" is now so iconic that it's usually kept as a box in modern adaptations. Pandora being motivated by curiosity is also a late addition to the story, the result of her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">conflated with Eve</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s original telling, she's never told not to open the jar/box nor is there any indication that she doesn't know what's in it. She doesn't have a stated motive in Hesiod's version, but the implication is that she just did it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Tale of Cupid and Psyche, jealous Venus sends Cupid to use his arrows to cause Psyche (whose beauty is praised above Venus, naturally) to fall in love with the most hideous thing in the world. Cupid bungles the assignment and pricks himself with love's arrow, falling in love with Psyche instantly. Psyche finds herself living the good life with a god, but on the condition that she never see her new husband. Naturally, this works out no better than any of the other examples on this page.
<ul><li> Not to mention how, when Venus ordered her to bring her a portion of Persephone's beauty, Psyche was warned not to eat anything in the underworld except for bread and also not to open the box Persephone gave her. She obeys the first order but disobeys the second, and would have likely slept forever had Cupid not intervened.
</li><li> A very similar fate befalls Semele, one of Zeus's lovers.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Greek example is the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus was a famed singer whose fiancee, Eurydice, was bitten on the heel by a poisonous snake and killed, while she was fleeing centaurs who were trying to rape her on her wedding day. Grieving for his lost wife, Orpheus traveled to the underworld and sang to Hades and Persephone, begging them to release Eurydice and allow her to live the rest of her life. They were so moved by his song that they relented, saying that Eurydice's spirit would follow him out of the underworld and she would be restored to life once they reached the surface. The one caveat to this agreement was that Orpheus was never to look back when he was leaving the underworld. Orpheus climbed back out the way he came but, as he reached the surface, suddenly began wondering if Eurydice was really following him... and guess what happened next. Unable to quench his doubt, he turned to check if Eurydice was behind him. She was just a few steps from leaving the Underworld and returning to life but, since he had broken his pledge, her spirit sank back into the underworld and, despite much more begging on Orpheus's behalf, Hades and Persephone wouldn't give him a second chance.
<ul><li> This exact scenario occurs in <em>This Rough Magic</em> with the unhappy ending avoided. Everyone was amazed when they reached the surface and the distrustful and suspicious protagonist had managed to not look behind him. Turned out that he hadn't just been capricious when he had that soldier polish his armor so much. He made sure to walk behind that soldier and could see his wife's reflection behind him in it.

He saw that she had become a hideous beast and began to flee from her, which evoked her wrath and caused her to send her minions after him to trap him in the underworld, though he did end up escaping.

Before he bought it, it was losing money hand-over-fist due to lack of customers, but now everybody in town wants to go there specifically <em>because</em> they aren't allowed in. Other businesses soon start copying this strategy.

Needless to say, Flap looked in the drawer.
</li><li> In the 1930s Fleischer cartoon "Koko's Earth Control", Koko the Clown and his dog walk to the North Pole, where they find a control room with levers that control weather, earthquakes, and volcanoes all over the Earth. One lever is clearly marked with a warning not to touch it. Of course, the dog (who can read) can't resist.
</li><li> Straight from the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, it is made clear that one thing you do <em>not</em> do if you want to stay on Raven's good side is go in her room. The other members of the team are actually able to resist doing so until the episode "Nevermore", where Beast Boy and Cyborg enter by accident and then find out why... She has <em>dangerous</em> stuff in there. In fact, the stuff in her room even makes <em>her</em> nervous sometimes. In "Fear Itself", she wakes up after having a nightmare, looks around nervously, and says, "Maybe I should consider redecorating..."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> episode "The Passion of the Dauterive", when Bill starts a relationship with Reverend Stroup, he's mostly invested in it because he perceives it as "forbidden" and controversial. When Stroup decides to circumvent any controversy by resigning as pastor, Bill becomes despondent that their romance is no longer special and ends up breaking up with her.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> episode "I Don't", Kevin drags Mack to a bridal expo being held at the school where their girlfriends Brittany and Jodie are modelling dresses, despite being told not to. Kevin ends up namedropping the trope while explaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">his reasoning for doing so</a>, believing (incorrectly) that the girls are employing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology">Reverse Psychology</a>.

<ul><li> There is a psychological reason for this. People are naturally attracted to freedom — that is, having as many options open to them as possible. When an option is closed off your instinct is to open it back up; this is the root (or a contributing factor) to many other phenomena, such as mid-life crises where people start to realize all the options that are passing them by. In general, this effect is greatly lessened if a (good, valid and fair) reason is given for not doing something, since then it feels like you have the option but are choosing not to, whereas if you are forbidden without an explanation it feels like you are being restricted. For the same reason telling people what to do instead of what not to do usually avoids this problem. This effect is strongest in teenagers because they are just starting to realize freedoms but don't have any boundaries set yet.
</li><li> This can be seen heavily around late 2012 and early 2013 with New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg attempting to pass a law that states restaurants and other establishments that sell soda could no longer sell soda larger than sixteen ounces, in order to fight rising health care costs related to obesity. The proposed ban was met with extremely negative responses from citizens and establishment owners alike. People stated that they could easily buy two sixteen ounce cups of soda and it wouldn't solve the problem that the mayor was trying to curb; people who wanted to have a lot of soda would still find ways to get it. In other words, by restricting what sizes of soda people could purchase to drink, people would be <em>encouraged</em> to drink large amounts of soda by searching for ways around the ban.
</li><li> This trope is <em>why</em> many attempts to discourage tobacco use/cigarette smoking often run into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a> and/or become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthCigaretteCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthCigaretteCommercial">Stealth Cigarette Commercial</a>. Too strong of an emphasis on the dangers to life? Congratulations, you've now turned smokers into badasses who are willing to <em>risk their lives</em> to look cool! Too much of a "smoking is not a thing normal well-adjusted people do" approach? Oh look, now you have a bunch of people who consider smoking rebellious and a way to lash out at "normal, well-adjusted society," or who intentionally take it up as a form of attention-seeking for how "self-harming" they are. Proclaiming it as instantly addictive to anyone who as much as <em>looks</em> at a cigarette? Making your campaign laughable to social smokers or to people who try it and go "meh." The more successful attempts to discourage it rely on focusing on immediate/near-immediate damage to appearance or performance, or on educating people that tobacco companies <em>want</em> people to view smoking as Forbidden Fruit rather than "being made into consumers of a product that slowly demands ongoing consumption, ongoing payment for consumption, and threatens their lives and health as it does."
</li><li> Similarly, anti-drug campaigns that focus on the idea that <em>any</em> and <em>all</em> "illegal" drugs cause instant addiction, violence, or death. The problem with such is that when people <em>try</em> the Forbidden Fruit and can take it or leave it (that time, at least), have a perfectly nonviolent good time, and/or don't die, <em>it entirely discredits the message as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>.</em> Even where such messages are based in fact, e.g. with cocaine/crack, methamphetamine, and opiates, such extreme effects are often the result of somewhat long-term, heavy/frequent, and/or extremely irresponsible use, often coupled with intense poverty and/or social sanctions. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rsox');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rsox" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rsox');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> There <em>are</em> some "recreational" drugs that <em>can</em> easily kill on first use, but the best example of such (datura/jimsonweed) is entirely legal and barely ever gets <em>mentioned</em> in anti-drug education.</span>
<ul><li> Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2000, instead of being arrested anyone caught with less than a "ten-day supply" of any illegal drug simply had their drugs confiscated and was ordered to appear before a panel, with the maximum penalty being a 250  fine. Since then, drug use has <a class="urllink" href="https://news.vice.com/article/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin">dropped considerably<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> When the Netherlands decriminalized marijuana teenage use dropped from 11% to 8%. Guess we know who was just trying to be a rebel.
</li></ul></li><li> When potatoes were introduced in France, Antoine Parmentier promoted them around 1786 by having potato fields in Sablons (near-ish to Paris) protected by royal troops, thus giving the impression that said vegetables were a delicacy, fit only for nobles' or the king's table. Of course, the men posted were told to accept bribes and retire at nightfall, making it extra-easy for peasants to give in to temptation... (Note that a similar gambit is attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick II the Great</a> of Prussia, c. 1744; however, there are no contemporary accounts of Frederick using this trick on Prussian peasants until several years <em>after</em> Parmentier's confirmed experiment, making it more likely that these accounts are simply Germans attributing to the revered Frederick (who actually did encourage the spread of potato farming in his lands) a particularly clever trick performed by a Frenchman. Historians generally accept that Frederick introduced the potato to Prussia by a rather more traditionally Prussian route: requiring peasants to grow potatoes, with stiff penalties for those who refused, and regular checks by the Army to ensure everyone complied.)
</li><li> The <em>Ripley's Believe It Or Not</em> museum in Atlantic City, New Jersey has a display piece which is nothing more than a large steamer trunk and a sign which says "Open at your own risk." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trunk doesn't actually have anything inside that's worth seeing, but lifting the lid activates a hidden mechanism. The person opening the trunk is abruptly hit, via a barely noticeable hole in the floor, with a sharp blast of very cold air. It's an experiment in human curiosity.</span>
</li><li> The US Department of Energy is currently <a class="urllink" href="http://www.arch.ksu.edu/seamon/Brill.htm">designing a facility in New Mexico to contain hazardous nuclear waste for 10,000 years.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One of the design challenges is avoiding tempting future treasure-hunters who might mistake the warnings and defenses as proof that something <em>valuable</em> is stored within. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100731021659/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Anthro/Anth101/wipp.html">The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One of the big problems is building the warnings and defenses in such a way that they will still be recognisable as such ten thousand years in the future.
</li><li> The Silica packets labelled "Do Not Eat" in packages of beef jerky and clothing have puzzled people for decades, thinking they'll drop dead if a single bead lands on their tongue. In reality it's a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessicant">dessicant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that keeps its environment dry by drawing moisture out of the air. It's non-toxic and will harmlessly pass through your body if swallowed. Its main danger is that it's a potential choking hazard for young children. As this trope's intro paragraph states, simply labeling it as a choking hazard as a valid reason not to eat it would allay people's curiosity, but "DO NOT EAT" is much easier to fit on the tiny packet.
</li><li> The likeliest reason why they have warning labels like "Do not attempt to stop chainsaw with hands or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">genitals</a>."

By trying to censor something you don't want people to see, all you're doing is drawing attention to it and making them want to know what all the fuss is about, whereas they wouldn't have known or even cared otherwise.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalag_fiction">Holocaust porn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was created in, of all places, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">Israel</a>.

</li><li> The Index of Prohibited Books created by the Roman Catholic Church during the Renaissance. Something on this list will be almost guaranteed to be a bestseller. Most of them are pretty boring though, prohibited for some obscure technicality. Probably the most famous is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalleusMaleficarum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalleusMaleficarum">Malleus Maleficarum</a></em>, which got so famous that many people still think it was endorsed by the Inquisition rather than condemned.
</li><li> In the 18th century, physicians for Britain's Royal Navy discovered that sailors could avoid suffering from scurvy on long sea voyages if they ate sauerkraut, which is rich in vitamin C. It was easy enough to order naval officers to eat sauerkraut, but the sailors refused to eat this unfamiliar food with its sharp acidic taste. Admiral Nelson solved this problem by storing the sauerkraut in barrels marked "For Officers' Mess Only", knowing that the sailors would steal and eat food that was exclusively for officers.
</li><li> One of Bernie Madoff's tactics while running his colossal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ponzi">Ponzi scheme</a> was <em>turning down</em> customers, even when they <em>begged him</em> to take their money. Not only did this convey the image that Madoff was such an "investment genius" that he could afford to turn down "unworthy" clientele, but it even convinced skeptics that his practices were legit: a scammer wouldn't turn down free money, right? This also reinforced the common idea of how his scheme worked. It was believed by many of his investors that he was a fraud but that he was using said fraud to benefit them through his investment firms. Such a scheme only worked if it was small however and most of his investors thought it was a small side business rather than his main source of income. Con artists in general, once a strong enough hook is put into a mark, will occasionally encourage the mark to speak to their bankers or lawyers about it. Being told it's a bad idea only reinforces the image that they've found a quick, dirty way to make a fortune.
</li><li> Scottish, Welsh, and Irish people refer to this as the "Celtic Paradox"; the only way to enjoy something is if you think you're doing something bad.
</li><li> Telling someone not to do something will usually result in them doing it. To avoid this, a direct order must be given. Dentists should say "keep your mouth open" instead of "don't close your mouth." The former is an order while the latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a> once said, "If you want to ensure a book is read, have it banned." The same premise goes for movies, games, and... well, anything else, really.
</li><li> There is a particularly large fountain on the campus of Florida State University that has a sign saying "Please Keep Out of Fountain". It had become tradition for students to throw their friends in the fountain on their birthday, right up until the powers that be decided to do away with the "keep out of the fountain" rule since no one listened anyway. The birthday dunkings stopped until a student group petitioned the school to make it against the rules again.
</li><li> United States Army Special Forces really liked the green beret, because it looked cool. At least until it became part of their official uniform, only then did they realize how impractical it was.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Incompatible Orientation</a> is being attracted to someone that, by definition, you can't have, and for many, this obsession is <em>because</em> they can't have the other person rather than despite it. Every gay/bisexual person alive knows the torment of having feelings for someone straight, many a straight woman has claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheGoodMenAreGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheGoodMenAreGay">All the Good Men Are Gay</a>, and some straight men view lesbians as a "challenge" rather than someone whose boundaries they should respect.
</li><li> Countries where women are legally allowed to go topless at beaches or be nude in public altogether tend to have lower rates of rape. (Though that could be because these countries generally have more gender equality).
</li><li> Let's just say there's a reason why so many underage viewers tune into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> or watch R-rated (or higher) movies. And why there are so many 8-year-olds on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo">Halo</a></em>.
</li><li> The public disapproval towards things like swearing and bathroom humour is a major part of the reason why many people find such humour to be side-splitting funny.
</li><li> This was the intended effect of the marketing campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em>, consisting of middle-aged and elderly people, mostly females, talking about how disgusted they are at how the game is so sick and depraved and how no one should play it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3lrdu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3lrdu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3lrdu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Helpfully called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2</a>"</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits">Extra Credits</a></em> blasted this commercial for perpetuating stereotypes of gamers being immature idiots, as well as Electronic Arts for continuing to market its games in this way.
</li><li> An article on cheezburger.com featured a news story about a heroic teenage boy who saved a female friend from being hit by a car, being seriously injured himself in the process. Mods threatened to ban the first commenter to say "friend zone." Predictably, multitudes began creating accounts specifically for the purpose of saying "friend zone."
</li><li> Unlicensed console video games had a certain mystique when Nintendo and other companies kept a shorter leash on video game developers. Most of them were terrible, including the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52">Action 52</a></em>.
</li><li> Unfortunately, being classified as an endangered species might turn some animals into this, as poachers and other criminals might find ways to exploit these animals for some kind of profit. There is also a certain desire among some wealthy people who want the remains of these endangered species <em>because</em> they're endangered. The most prominent case is elephant ivory: Due to the endangered status of African elephants, their ivory sells for ludicrously high prices, which together become incredibly alluring to such people. The Northern White Rhinoceros is another example, with demand for their horns so high (worth more than their weight in gold) that poachers are willing to do anything<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xoq9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4xoq9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xoq9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This includes shooting them in plain sight, killing people at preserves, killing the guards stationed to protect them, following safari tourists on social media to pinpoint a rhino's location, and poisoning waterholes, which will kill many other unrelated animals just by drinking the water there</span> just so they can sell their horns. They have become extinct in the wild, with, as of the time of this writing, only three such purebred rhinos still alive, all of them in zoos. This is especially true in cases where regulations designed to protect the species make its habitat impossible to develop or exploit; property owners who discover such species on their land have a financial incentive not to report them — and the easiest way to cover up this crime is to get rid of the endangered animals.
</li><li> Legend says that on Lewis and Clark's famous trek through the mostly-unexplored Louisiana Territory, a group of Native Americans came up to them, and one of them said, "You can hunt the brown bear, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">but do not hunt the grizzly bear</a>." Needless to say, they agreed to try it — and both almost lost their lives in the attempt.
</li><li> When Michael Jordan signed the contract with Nike for his signature Air Jordan shoes, NBA fined him $5,000 per game, because the shoes didn't have enough white color on them. Nike gladly paid the fine for him and started advertising the shoes as "Banned", knowing the appeal of this trope.
</li><li> Infidelity is often caused by this trope. Being with only one person makes you notice all the attractive people you're <em>not</em> with, and if the relationship is monogamous (at least, on paper), these are people you can <em>never</em> be with. This alone can cause temptation to cheat even if the relationship is healthy and satisfying.
</li><li> One college professor of literature announced to his students that they would be studying <em>Canterbury Tales</em> that semester, all except "The Nun's Priest's Tale". That one, he said, was too dirty to read. The next time class was in session, he promptly held a discussion on "The Nun's Priest's Tale". Every student was prepared.
</li><li> The "Forbidden Snacks" meme, revolving around pictures of inedible, sometimes poisonous objects that look like brightly-colored candy or other snack foods. Laundry detergent pods — Tide Pods in particular — were a common example, and the meme turned out to be one of the catalysts for the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tide-pod-challenge">Tide Pod Challenge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> There are some establishments that like to have fun with this. In the bathrooms, there will be an image of an attractive, nearly naked person (usually the opposite gender of the bathroom they're in, i.e. a woman in the men's bathroom and a man in the woman's bathroom) with the important bits supposedly covered by a panel. Should someone open the panel, a buzzer will go off and everyone in the establishment will know that someone wanted to see a nude person's important bits.
</li><li> Put an item you want to get rid of but that's too useful to throw away (like a desk) out by the road, with "Free, take me" on it, and it'll stay there forever. Put "$20" on it and it'll disappear in an hour.
