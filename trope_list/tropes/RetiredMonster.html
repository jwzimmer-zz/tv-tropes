In fact, he caused most of it. When you first see him, he'll come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> <em>at best</em>; he'll also have experience and advice that he might give out to a young hero, although possibly the best he can do is "You should stay away from people like me" However, he'll be creepier than the other guy, and he'll tempt the young ones, giving them advice more on the cynical side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>. You see, he's not doing any gross evil acts now — he may not have done so much as run a red light in the past ten years — but that's only because he's tired. As the backstory of this character becomes known, we learn that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kicked the dog</a> a number of times, perhaps took a hopscotch over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, only stopping because for some reason they got sick of it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Perhaps he finally came out worse for wear after a run-in with the guy who's now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a>. Maybe he was caught and sent into exile and now has at least enough fear of the authorities to not put a toe out of line. Then again, often, they have just literally retired, saying "I'm too old for this" and using their pension fund of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziGold">Nazi Gold</a> to support a life of margaritas on the beach.
</p><p>They've never apologized (not sincerely at least) for their actions, there was no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and they are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> who'll help to make up for some wrong. No, they'll just sit back, but if a character underestimates their evil, if they think that because they aren't as bad as the more active monsters, that they're OK, they may get a horrid reminder of what the Retired Monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">is still capable of.</a> Usually, they'll either be a mentor to the villain they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a> to, or even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a> if they are helping the hero.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>It's not rare for this kind of character to produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackTheRipoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackTheRipoff">copycat villains</a>, either out of genuine admiration or because said villains are trying to throw the authorities off track by blaming the Retired Monster for their crimes. Usually the Retired Monster is less than amused about this, and he will go straight back into action to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaKillThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaKillThemAll">dispose of these guys personally</a> or to help the heroes in apprehending them, as a way to "clean" his name of crimes he didn't commit. In any case, he has bucket loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">Villain Cred</a>.
</p><p>Monsters who don't retire, or come out of retirement and continue to be evil in old age, can become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks">Evil Old Folks</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>, due to the fact that very few of this type of character are found in jail. Compare the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a>, one of several good counterparts, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredOutlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredOutlaw">Retired Outlaw</a>, which may occasionally overlap. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>, who said monster can become if he does end up regretting his past crimes later in his retired life.

When he took in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obito</span>, he was a one-eyed, decrepit man kept alive only due to a life support system he had jury-rigged from an experiment. He seemed largely uninterested in the outside world and was even helpful. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, he had spent the last few decades preparing his big comeback and Obito was just the final piece in his plan</span>.
</li><li> Danzo is suitably monstrous and pretends to be retired from his duties outside of acting as an advisor. Most of the cast knows he's still running Root and tasking them with black-on-black ops. He comes fully out of retirement when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he becomes Candidate Hokage</span>, only to have all of the enemies he's made come out of the woodwork when he steps out of Konoha.
</li><li> Orochimaru becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> version of this by the end of the manga. While the Leaf Village keeps tabs on him and make sure he doesn't do anything <em>too</em> evil, he is allowed to more or less live in peace and perform (hopefully) non-evil experiments; he even keeps some of his own subordinates and lives in his old lair. Creepily, given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a> tendencies, his physical appearance has changed yet again, leaving it as unclear if he managed to possess yet another person before his enforced retirement or if he used some other method. For a character that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">murdered numerous children, include BABIES</a>, killed his own master, tried to start a world war by annihilating his home town, and operated for decades as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, the fact that he is let off more or less scot-free is pretty amazing.

<ul><li> During the Buu saga, he makes this speech about how he <em>wanted</em> to go back to the days when he was a cold-hearted, ruthless brute who thought of nothing but causing pain and suffering to others. An episode earlier, when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes Majin</span>, he proclaims to the Supreme Kai when he's told to be innocent and clear, "How can you say that! I'm not innocent!" He knows he was an evil monster once and wishes to let that monster inside him loose again.
<ul><li> This is because he feels he's gone "soft" and that he could—and should—be stronger than he is. By returning to the old state of mind, he believes he'd be able to use his full power. There is a bit of a subversion, however, ironically enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Porunga was asked to revive all those on earth who aren't pure evil, Vegeta is resurrected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">He then appears genuinely stunned at just what that means</a>.</span>

</li><li> The original premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nexus">Nexus</a></em> was that the title character was compelled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons">alien forces</a> to seek out and execute mass murderers.

</li><li> In the pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Super Genesis Wave</a> world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, the immortal and ancient villain Mammoth Mogul eventually decides that trying to conquer the world while Sonic is still around to fight him is way too much trouble.

</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>'s oldest enemies (the first, in fact) was the Mole Man. After years of trying to gain revenge against civilization for neglecting him by leading the giant beasts of Monster Island against cities, he decided he was tired of it, and retired from villainy. (For the most part. While he's had enough of being in the limelight, things tend to happen that drag him back into it from time to time....)
</li><li> Sidewinder, a villain usually associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, went into semi-retirement when he led the Serpent Society, being at most a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">non-action villain.</a> He moved to full retirement after the Society double-crossed him.

Somewhere along the way, he decided he enjoyed being wealthy, having lots of famous friends, and being seen in the company of beautiful women more than he enjoyed being a crook - so he "officially" retired from crime and opened the Iceberg Lounge, one of Gotham City's most popular casino-nightclubs (and for that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">he also stopped wearing his top hat</a>). However, the Penguin didn't withdraw from crime entirely: while he never <em>actively</em> gets into mischief, he still runs a gang and has them do all his dirty work. Batman and other Gotham heroes tolerate this because Cobblepot sometimes "overhears" information they need in his nightclub that he's willing to share - off the record. So, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> meets this trope.

He still works as a weapons supplier to any supervillain (and shadier hero) willing to pay.
</li><li> Another Spider-Man foe that fits is Roderick Kingsley aka Hobgoblin (pictured above), who has a tendency to go in and out of retirement from supervillainy for months or years at a time during which he enjoys his ill-gotten gains. Every now and then he goes back to being Hobgoblin, usually to defend his villain cred.

Shortly afterwards, it is revealed that Tom Riddle's true love has always been teaching, something he lost all chances of doing when he declared himself the Dark Lord Voldemort. However, as Harry Potter, no such negative acts have been attached to his name, so instead of revealing himself and reclaiming control over his former minions, "Harry" decides to go through Hogwarts until he graduates so he can get a teaching position there. The problem is that the rest of Voldemort's soul <em>isn't</em> retired.

He wants to retire from supervillainy and crime to spend time with his family whom he was forced to abandon to avoid them getting hurt in the crossfire. However, All for One deliberately raises Shiragaki as a scapegoat to pin his crimes on and doesn't even remotely regret any of the atrocities he committed.

In reference to Bill shooting the Bride years before, he says "I would have just cut your face." Doesn't sound so bad compared to what Bill did, but just then he calls one of his girls over to the table sporting a hideous and disfiguring scar running across her mouth. He hands her a hanky to wipe off some drool, then she fetches him a drink. The man is only <em>semi</em>-retired. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">(Doesn't stop him from being the nicest gangland pimp you could possibly imagine, though.)</a>
</li><li> Pai Mei, an ancient Kung Fu master with a history of atrocities and bloodshed, who sports an unpleasantly racist and sexist worldview, along with the knowledge that he can do anything to anyone without fear since he is just too tough and skilled to die. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until Elle Driver poisons his fish heads in retaliation for snatching out her eye, that is.</span> Ironically, Bill thinks that he's getting lonely because everybody is too frightened to approach him, and that's why he accepts apprentices he despises, even though it doesn't stop him from abusing them as much as he likes. Even more ironically, despite being a chauvinist who hates Americans, the Bride (an American woman) becomes his best student, and the only one he is willing to teach his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">most powerful technique</a> to. She even starts to love him like a father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventually avenges his death by tearing out Ellie's other eye and leaving her to die in the desert.</span>
</li><li> Most of the Deadly Vipers themselves qualify. Bill had long retired from assassination work by the time Beatrix caught up to him, electing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raise their daughter</span> instead, Vernita quit outright and preferred to try and build a family, and Budd was just living out his days in a trailer and working as a bouncer. Beatrix herself also qualifies, having a change of heart after getting pregnant and wanting to leave the profession and live in El Paso, though Bill would have nothing of it. The other two members, Elle Driver and O'ren Ishi'i, however, were still active; Driver was still doing professional assassinations and Ishi'i had taken over the Yakuza gangs of Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> The porter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSeventhSeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSeventhSeal">The Seventh Seal</a></em> establishes himself as this with one scene. He rescues a woman from an attacker, then off-handedly mentions that he could rape her, but he isn't going to, because participating in the Crusades has made him bored with rape.
</li><li> Charlie Barrett in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideKings">Suicide Kings</a></em> is a former mob boss who used to have his enemies fed to their own dogs.

The Brethren Court, who are all pretty badass Pirate Lords in their own right are scared by his mere appearance at the meeting, even though he immediately slumps down in the corner and absent-mindedly begins playing with a guitar. When one of them suggests not following the Code for the second time, one of his strings snaps and he looks up, terrifying them all into silence. He makes his appearance by shooting another pirate in cold blood showing that he is only semi-retired and naturally steals the scene since anyone capable of hitting someone in the chest from <em>that</em> far with a single-shot musket pistol would humble all around him.
</li><li> Yoon Tae-goo "The Weird" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadTheWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadTheWeird">The Good, the Bad, the Weird</a></em> turns out to be one of these. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Part of the reason Park Do-won, "The Good", is hunting Park Chang-yi, "The Bad" (no relation) is because he believes Chang-yi is this notorious bandit known as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">Finger Chopper</a>". While Chang-yi is a total psycho, it's ultimately revealed that Tae-goo was the Finger Chopper and Chang-yi lost a finger to him.</span> This reveal probably has a lot to do with Tae-goo being an Expy of Tuco of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em>, right down to the similar names, and in both cases, the seemingly comic relief character has a rap sheet of some seriously awful crimes. The main difference between these two is that in "Weird", Chang-yi is more than just a one-dimensional villain who makes Tae-goo look <em>worse</em> in comparison.
</li><li> William Munny of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em> is one of these, in a deconstruction treatment of Clint Eastwood's Western anti-hero roles. While it doesn't seem like he necessarily <em>enjoyed</em> killing, in his youth as a bandit, Munny was a cold-blooded mass murderer - killer of women, children, and animals. The events of the movie bring him out of retirement. English Bob could also be considered one of these. While at present, he plays the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemittanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemittanceMan">Remittance Man</a> and is a sort of celebrity, it's indicated that he was previously employed killing Chinese laborers for the railroads, and the truth behind his gunfighter exploits is that he was a dishonorable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>.

<ul><li> In one episode the protagonists meet a Cardassian with a similar background, being the brutal camp commandant of a forced labour camp, brazenly flaunting his guilt... or was he? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out he was merely a filing clerk who had assumed his identity, having been driven mad with guilt for all the atrocities committed there. His goal was to be executed as penance for never speaking out against the brutality, and to shine a light unwanted by the Cardassian government on the atrocities committed</span>.
</li><li> Garak is a complicated subversion. He was caught and exiled for an unspecified crime (hinted to be some kind of treason or betrayal of the Obsidian Order) and he has a reputation for being a very dangerous man who shouldn't be trusted. However, as the show progresses, it's becomes less clear that this reputation is as cut-and-dried as it first seemed. Eventually, it becomes clear that he's not so much heartless about the past, and he may not easily admit it or apologise for it, but he's carrying at least <em>some</em> guilt about it. His motivation for everything he did in the Order was a bitter and cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">I Did What I Had to Do</a>, and he wasn't above sacrificing his own sense of morality for his job or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shooting The Dog</a> if he had to.
<ul><li> He became a part of the Obsidian Order in the first place because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father,</span> Enabran Tain, was trying to mould him into the perfect operative... and he succeeded. However, although Garak has done many morally ambiguous things in his life and was even brought up to enjoy performing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a>, he doesn't feel that good about it in retrospect, and it's clear that the main reason he did what he did was his acute loyalty to Cardassia and the belief that he was doing what he had to do for his people. His observation of some of the worst that sentient creatures - Cardassian and otherwise - are capable of in the murky underworld of covert operations has made him incredibly cynical but also fascinated with the Federation, particularly Julian Bashir, whose compassion and desire to help people is completely alien to him. Although he is <em>incredibly</em> dangerous if you get on his wrong side, his enforced "retirement" and consequent exposure to the Federation has allowed him to learn compassion and to lose his taste for the more unsavoury aspects of his job description. His moral compass has definitely been pulled a certain way since he was exiled, leading him to act more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a> than a Retired Monster.
</li><li> The show hints that he's been hiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">dissident</a> sympathies. When trapped between obeying the state (killing them) or letting them go free he acknowledges it's against his better judgement to oppose them and eventually lets them go free. It's not the last time he helps dissidents either, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">much to the consternation of an old Obsidian Order colleague of his.</span>
</li><li> To Enabran Tain (who exiled him) he is clearly very upset over how things turned out between them (but then, we don't know the circumstances to know why).
</li><li> When he is ordered to torture a captured prisoner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odo</span>, he's uncomfortable with the idea but carries it through. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He succeeds in torturing himself almost as much as he tortures Odo, <em>begging</em> Odo to give him even the smallest bit of information so he can have an excuse to stop the torture</span>.

</li><li> When he's commissioned by the Federation as a code-breaker in the fight against the Dominion (and therefore Cardassia), he suffers a claustrophobic breakdown which turns out to be as a result of him bottling an immense guilt over the role he's playing in the fight against Cardassians.
</li><li> At the end of the show, he gives a speech observing how the decimation of Cardassia could be considered payback for the awful actions they've committed against other species during their military expansionist phase.
</li></ul></li><li> Enabran Tain, Garak's superior <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and father</span> and the man who ran the Obsidian Order for twenty years, is completely unrepentant of his crimes and killing whomever <em>might</em> be a threat (while Garak seemed to be always looking for excuses to <em>not</em> kill someone, Tain seemed to be looking for excuses <em>to</em> kill). It's his missing the old days which prompts him to actually come out of retirement and forge an alliance with the Tal Shiar to strike at the Dominion preemptively. This doesn't end well.

<ul><li> The demon lord Pale Night is an ancient being that many other demon lords claim is their mother (and some claim the current race of demons can trace their bloodline back to). Nowadays, she tends to stay in her palace, distancing herself from the mortals, the Blood War, and other demons.... But, may the gods help anyone she catches trespassing on her property. Some she turns into soulless husks whom she keeps as trophies (and guardians) while others she lets go, only to live with the horrors they've seen forever.
</li><li> Another ancient demon who is now retired, but not by her choice, is the Queen of Chaos. In the mythic Age Before Ages eons ago, she ruled the obyrith, the race of demons that first populated the Abyss, and led them on a war of genocide against the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. She was such a monster, she murdered any obyrith who refused to join her forces. Eventually, however, her army was defeated by the Wind Dukes due to the creation of the Rod of Law (later the Rod of Seven Parts), her second-in-command and consort Miska the Wolf Spider was banished to Pandemonium, and the obyrith nearly driven to extinction as a result. Neither the Queen nor the obyrith ever recovered; since then, she has laired in the 14th layer of the Abyss, known as the Steaming Fen, licking her wounds, dreaming of freeing Miska and returning to glory.
</li><li> The baernoloths are the creators of the yugoloth race (until the 4th edition, where the yugoloths were included among demons via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a>) but long ago entrusted leadership of the race to the ultraloths and retreated to the farthest locales of the Grey Waste. The few encounters that mortals have with these ancient fiends have yielded reports of horrid and blasphemous experiments, but fortunately, the baernoloths don't seem to have the great power they are said to have once had.
</li><li> Also, there are the Rabble of Devilkin, powerful unique devils who reside on the first layer of Hell. Technically, they are exiled, not retired, formerly being Dukes of Hell (or in the case of Moloch and Geryon, rulers of whole layers) who were stripped of their position for some reason, but spared death for other reasons. Most are content to simply stay in their lairs and keep to themselves, but a few have made vain attempts to regain their former positions, so much that in such cases, their names have been stripped of them to prevent mortals from summoning them. One notable Rabble is Armaros, a being who is believed to be the most powerful devil in existence and a wizard with godlike magical power. Only Asmodeus himself is allowed to visit him (which he does quite often, possibly for advice) and no-one else dares disturb his magical research.
</li><li> A few ancient evil gods match this Trope; legends say they were once powerful gods, but because this cosmology is one where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>, these gods suffered as their races became weaker and lost their influence on mortal worlds, becoming slothful and neglected due to the lack of worship. (This happens to non-evil gods too sometimes, but not as often, for some reason.) Examples include Ramenos, the frog-god of the bullywugs, Merrshaulk, the god of the yuan-ti (a race that challenged humans for dominance and lost), Laogzed, the deity worshipped by troglodytes (now little more than a giant lizard that other gods think of as a divine garbage disposal), and Gorellik, who used to be the patron deity of gnolls until that position was usurped by the demon lord Yeenoghu, causing him to wander the lower planes, seemingly with no purpose.
</li><li> Jergal of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> is a <em>literal</em> Retired Monster. He was once a Greater Deity who commanded the portfolios of Murder, Strife, and Death. But over time, he grew weary of his roles. So when a trio of ambitious mortals demanded that he give his power to them, he agreed. And that's how Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul came to be. Jergal now serves a more humble role as the seneschal to the Lord of the Dead.
</li><li> The <em>Tome of Magic</em> mentions Andras, the Gray Knight. He was once an elven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">paladin</a> who crusaded for good, only for a series of misfortunes to prompt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a>, driving him to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">blackguard</a> just as vile as the hero he once was. But after three hundred years of service to both good and evil, Andras grew tired of both causes, and in the middle of a pitched battle, he just dropped his sword and quit the field, never to be seen again. Since no afterlife would welcome his soul, Andras was condemned to become a vestige.
