</p><p>Killing is messy. You have to deal with those pesky murder charges, or go to the effort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">engineering a convenient "accident"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">"suicide" to avert suspicion</a>, or clean up the crime scene to hide your involvement. But as fate would have it, if your foe winds up in a fatal position and you are their only means of survival, all you have to do to kill them... is <em>nothing</em> at all.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this concept is called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue">the duty to rescue.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, the failure to offer help for those in need isn't usually considered a crime (because of the can of worms that opens when you punish someone for "not doing anything"), but there <em>are</em> countries where people are obligated by the law to come to the aid of those in life peril. In France for example, abandoning a helpless person can earn you a prison sentence of up to five years. On the other hand, you cannot be prosecuted for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">a bad first aid</a>, precisely for the reason to prompt people to help those in need no matter what, unless it would endanger their own lives as well. Of course, an exception is made for on-duty emergency workers, law enforcement and military personnel, where failure to act is to violate your duty. It can also be your duty because of your relationship to the person: parents have a duty to rescue their minor children. Failing to act is also generally punishable if you're in some way responsible for creating the dangerous situation in the first place.

They decide they want to eat something with chopsticks and make them out of a tree's branches, while Ayu makes her chopsticks out of a different tree's branches. While eating, the girls end up dying from poison and blame Ayu for this, who calmly tells them that they were the ones that made their chopsticks from a poisonous tree-type.

He and Aries were Celestial Spirits in the service of the cruel Karen Lilica, and to save Aries from Karen's wrath, he switched places with Aries, and gave Karen an ultimatum- he'd remain in the human world and refuse to help Karen until she canceled both their contracts. Karen was initially confident that since Leo couldn't remain in the real world forever, he'd soon be forced to give up, but he lasted longer than she expected. In the end, Karen became desperate, since without her spirits, she couldn't work as a mage, and she eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">went on a job anyway and got herself killed.</a> The Celestial Spirit King blamed Loke for his mistress's death and banished him until Lucy successfully pleaded his case, saying that he'd only been protecting his friend Aries.

They go to him, but leave him lying without helping him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">so that he will die as a result of the traffic accident</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yuureitou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yuureitou">Yuureitou</a></em>, this turns out to be the real way Tetsuo's adoptive mother died: she was tied to the clock tower by a killer after the treasure within, but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">she'd abused Tetsuo for his transgender identity as a child</a> (including leaving <em>him</em> to die in the trap-filled labyrinth beneath the tower until he pretended to cry 'like a real girl'), he simply stood and watched. Tetsuo himself makes no attempt to claim it wasn't murder, telling the cops he'd killed her and using it as a reason that Amano shouldn't be his friend.

Did he really expect his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">elf maidens</a> to use their magical powers to save him when he was so clearly outmatched?
</li><li> The novel <em>Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> reveals that this was how Shisui Uchiha gained the Mangekyou Sharingan. He was on a mission with a close friend, who fell behind fighting the enemy forces. Shisui was jealous of said friend's talents and intentionally decided not to help him, resulting in his death.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">The guilt of realizing what he'd done</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">was what awakened the Mangekyou in him.</a>
</li><li> Discussed heavily towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> as part of its deconstruction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Legato</a> points out to Vash that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">by his unflinching refusal to kill anyone, no matter how evil or dangerous</a>, he is in fact responsible for the deaths they caused.

After massive backlash this was retconned into Thompkins making Batman think that Stephanie died when she was actually smuggled out of the country. (Then it was retconned <em>even further</em> into Batman and a few other adults in Stephanie's life being aware too, and everyone dancing around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> for complex psychological and political reasons...)

When the villain Abattoir is left dangling above a vat of molten steel, Jean-Paul is torn between fulfilling his duty as an avenging knight and killing him, or rejecting it and saving his life. Instead, he chooses neither and leaves Abattoir to eventually fall to his death — which also dooms the hostage he had hidden away. After Bruce recovers and learns about this, he realizes he can't trust Valley with the Batman identity anymore.

Letting the man die makes you lose a moral point while saving him gains you one, so there's incentive to do if you're trying to get the "good" ending. On the other hand, letting him die and then allowing the officers to walk away is preferable if you're trying not to kill anyone, which is required to get the achievement/trophy "Invisible Man" (and <em>also</em> gets you a moral point if you <em>do</em> go through the entire level without killing anyone).

Even his friends (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Mr. Peanutbutter</a>) keep their distance from him, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hollyhock cuts him out of her life in response to what happened</span>.
</li><li> It is implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> that Viren acted so that Harrow get killed. Harrow was the king, and Viren was his wizard, and at the same time his only friend, or at least his oldest and closest confidant. When Harrow learns that elfish assassins want to kill him, Viren offers him to save his life with dark magic. But Harrow, who for some unknown reason does not want to have anything more to do with dark magic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">reacts very gruffly</a>. He forces Viren <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">to kneel in front of him while humiliating, taunting and offending him</a>. When the elven assassins finally defeat the king's bodyguards, Viren does not move a finger to rescue Harrow. He even stops Callum from coming to the aid of the king. Later, General Amaya also accuses him of allowing the elves to kill Harrow so he can become king himself. It should be mentioned explicitly that it is unknown if Viren could have fended off the elven assassins because they were simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">very good assassins</a>. But because Harrow treated him so badly, of course, Viren did not do anything to protect him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode "Send in Stewie, Please," Stewie lets the preschool therapist he was talking to slowly die from a heart attack because he doesn't want his secrets getting out.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Sinestro</a> uses something like this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">as a defense</a> when his actions result in the in-custody death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Naraxis</a> ("I didn't kill him, I just didn't save him"), but its revealed to the viewer that Naraxis's death was anything but inadvertent; Sinestro actively manipulated events so that Naraxis would die, and actually gloated about it to the guy as he suffocated, making it just straight-up murder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Twilight", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> shows up in the Watchtower and asks for the League's help since Brainiac is attacking Apokolips. Superman, having suffered a lot at Darkseid's hands and expecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">that Darkseid has an ulterior motive</a>, only says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">Good.</a>" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Superman turns out to be right.</span>
</li><li> In "The Enemy Below", Aquaman confronts his evil brother Orm who stole the Trident of Poseidon, tried to overthrow him, and put him and his baby son near a submarine volcano to kill them both off. When Orm ends up hanging over an abyss during their last fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy">he shamelessly begs Aquaman to save him.</a> Aquaman just picks up his fallen trident while coldly saying "I believe this is mine" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">lets him fall.</a>
