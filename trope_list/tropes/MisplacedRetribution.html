Whether it is worse than what is retaliated to or milder, the point remains that it is still indefensibly directed at the wrong targets.

<ul><li> This is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>. Canada is frequently the target of this because he looks almost identical to his brother America, though the countries that are pissed at America wouldn't harm Canada if they knew the difference. That he's very soft spoken means he rarely is able to stop the abuse or convince the other countries (rightfully angry at America) from beating up on him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBreaker">The Breaker</a></em>, a great deal of characters are after Han Chun Wo, also known as Goomoonryong, because he killed their master or performed some other dishonorable thing upon their martial arts school. He is a complete and utter badass upon which they have no hope of carrying out their revenge. Therefore, they prefer to target his student, Yi Shioon, which becomes particularly unfair and messed up in <em>The Breaker: New Waves</em> when Shioon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> looses his ability to use ki and becomes completely helpless, is renounced by his Master as a student and is no longer a Murim (part of the martial arts world) and should be off limits</span>. Backfires pretty horribly on them since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Master actually started a process that would make Yi Shioon <em>even stronger</em> in Shioon's body (his ki center being broken was a necessary first step). After the first hundred chapters or so, they are seeing Shioon as a threat in his own right.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Accelerator's ward Last Order becomes gravely ill, so he frantically wanders everywhere and gets caught up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> while trying to find a way to cure her. While in a military convoy in Russia, he randomly runs into Touma Kamijou. Accelerator becomes enraged and attacks him, blaming him for being a hero yet not doing anything to help her. Touma defeats him and points out he can't be everywhere at once and didn't even know about Last Order's condition, and he was busy traveling to defeat the one who started the war. Touma adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot">he would have helped if he had just asked</a>, and temporarily heals Last Order before giving instructions for a permanent cure.
</li><li> Shinka Kanou learns that his friend Frenda Seivelun was killed by Shizuri Mugino. Rather than target Mugino, he decides to blame and try to kill Touma Kamijou, because he is a hero yet didn't save her. Shiage Hamazura confronts him and calls bullshit on this reasoning. During the time that Frenda was killed, Touma was in <em>another country</em> working on preventing civil wars and invasions. Shiage offers to take the blame because he actually was in the area when the murder happened and actually knew Frenda, unlike Touma who had never even heard of her. Shinka eventually has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified with the Kimura-Andou-Izayoi feud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>. Kimura blames Andou for getting her expelled from Hope's Peak Academy. Andou and Izayoi, in turn, blame Kimura for their expulsions. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagito Komaeda accidentally took a performance enhancing drug that Andou wanted and left her with the laxative he wanted. Naturally, when Andou spiked the candy she was making for a practical exam with the laxative, it ended up causing her proctors severe stomach pain. When Andou accused Kimura of setting her up, Kimura revealed a detonator for a bomb she had come into possession of when she accidentally swapped bags with the aforementioned Komaeda. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a giant mutant puppy attacked</a>, startling the two into detonating the bomb.</span> The result of this was that Kimura and Andou looked like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Mad Bombers</a>, getting them kicked out. Izayoi's expulsion is a straight example of this trope; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociationGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociationGag">he was basically lumped in with them because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and happened to be Andou's boyfriend</a>.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> movie, Broly wanted to <em>murder</em> Goten and Trunks for looking like Goku, the person Broly was originally looking for.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Doctors Gero and Myuu</a> plot to get revenge on Goku for their deaths...despite the fact that they <em>both</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">were killed by their own creations</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Scar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> tries to kill the Elric brothers shortly after he's introduced. Scar is one of the few surviving members of a genocide perpetrated by the Amestrian government, and so has good reason to be angry, but he chooses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageofRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageofRevenge">exact revenge</a> for the deaths of his people by killing State Alchemists, and <em>all</em> State Alchemists, regardless of whether or not they were involved in the Ishvalan conflict. Edward and Alphonse in particular were small children when the genocide took place, and had absolutely nothing to do with it.
<ul><li> Also, Scar murdered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Winry's parents</span> when it seemed like they were Amestrian scientists who were conducting experiments on Ishvalan survivors. They were doctors. As a bonus, turns out that the people responsible for the whole war were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Father and Envy</span>, who treat their Amestrian minions like fish food. Whoops.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JuuniSenshiBakuretsuEtoRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JuuniSenshiBakuretsuEtoRanger">Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger</a></em>, it turns out that the main villain Nyanma's mistakenly thought that, during her past as Chocolat, Princess Aura had deliberately tricked her into getting herself disqualified from a race by appearing in a vision to her and asking her to start the race too soon. This lead to Nyanma seeking power from the evil cat spirit Bagi, and led to Nyanma trying to sink the entire country of Mugen in revenge. But Nyanma's retribution is misplaced; it was <em>Bagi herself</em> who sent that vision to Chocolat to trick Chocolat into getting herself disqualified, so Chocolat would have a reason to do Bagi's dirty work in attacking Mugen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>, Nao, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned fully antagonistic</a> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing one of her eyes</span> in a fight with Natsuki (which, unbeknownst to either, was the result of manipulation by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Nao's alleged victim Yukariko</a></span>), decides to seek revenge on everyone whom she blames for this. This, unfortunately, includes Mai, who tried to stop the fight between Nao and Natsuki, and Nao decides to take revenge on Mai by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">targeting Takumi</a> instead</span>. To a degree, this can also apply to Shiho's grudge against Mai (for which she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Takumi by destroying Akira's Child</span>), since it was Yuuichi's declaration of love for Mai that showed her that he was attracted to her, rather than anything Mai did, although it also falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a> in that Shiho wants Mai out of the way as long as she is a potential rival.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MurasakiiroNoQualia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MurasakiiroNoQualia">Murasakiiro no Qualia</a></em>, Hatou torments Alice in several timelines in consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheCutie">Yukari's death</a>. Alice never meant for it to happen. Quite the opposite, she truly believed JAUNT would be able to protect Yukari.
</li><li> Sasuke Uchiha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> finds out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brother was ordered to kill his entire family</span> to save his village from civil war and prevent a world war that would've killed thousands of innocents all over the continent. Only the three village elders even knew about that, but Sasuke decides every man, woman, and child in the village, including dozens of people who used to be his friends/family substitutes/mentors, have to die because they owe their lives to what was done to him.
<ul><li> Though originally he, rather more reasonably, only wished to kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the three elders who had given the order in the first place</span>. Unfortunately, he later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">lost most of his SAN points</a> and decided that everyone who wasn't an Uchiha must have been in some way responsible for it and therefore needed to die.
</li><li> To an extent, Neji beating Hinata <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">within an inch of her life</a> during the Chunin exams, as he blamed her and the Hyuga Main House for the death of his father Hizashi.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> This was endemic among the Greek gods. "Zeus seduces (or flat out rapes) a mortal woman, then his wife afflicts that woman and/or her son with a curse as punishment" is a fairly typical plot outline, and the other gods weren't much better. Though because Zeus was simply too powerful for any of Hera's curses to have any effect on him, and Zeus actually <em>does</em> care about his mortal lovers and demigod sons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">there actually was a twisted logic to her actions</a>.
</li><li> A well-known version of the Medusa myth shares a similar theme. Medusa was a beautiful woman who was raped in Athena's temple by the god Poseidon. Athena was so enraged by her temple being violated that she of course curses Medusa, apparently for not being able to fend off a god, turning her into a gorgon. Some versions even have Athena take it one step further and cursing her sisters too.
</li><li> Aphrodite has a bad habit of doing this whenever there's someone who made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">Blasphemous Boast</a> that a certain woman is more beautiful than her. Just ask Psyche and Myrrha about this. In Psyche's case it was particularly bad, since it was <em>her suitors</em> who made the claim, not Psyche herself. On the other hand, she got off lucky because Aphrodite assigned her son Eros to carry out the retribution... and he promptly fell in love with Psyche.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>, the reason the G.U.N.

<ul><li> The Commander isn't the only one guilty of this.

And of course, G.U.N. over-reacted because Gerald was <em>committing high treason</em> by working with an alien conqueror to <em>create a super-soldier</em>. Shadow nearly followed through with Gerald's plan too, at least until Amy set him on the right track.

He was discriminated against as a half-elf. But instead of seeking retribution only on the humans who actually discriminated against him, he set a plan in motion that would make the entire human <em>race</em> suffer for a <em>thousand years.</em> This included treating humans as cattle, implementing a "Chosen" system that resulted in misery for those chosen, causing two worlds to have to share mana so one is always suffering, making people suffer to power up Exspheres, etc. As Lloyd puts it, Mithos took his own pain and forced it on everybody else.</span>

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Josh</span>'s plan targeted Sam and Chris (and a lesser degree, Ashley) as the brunt of the pranks, all three who were not as responsible compared to the others in Hannah's prank. Sam tried to stop the prank against Hannah. Chris was passed out drunk and not involved at all. Ashley was part of the prank but not a major player. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is possible as Sam and Chris were Josh's closest friends, Josh either felt most betrayed by them or he was projecting his own self-loathing and blame onto them that he wasn't able to help his sisters.</span>
</li><li> Considering the native belief that the mountain is protected by animal spirits, the consequences of harming nature can come off as this. Chris shooting a squirrel? <em>Sam</em> is the one who gets attacked by a bird, preventing her from escaping the Psycho later, despite her berating Chris for the act. Throw a snowball at a bird? Jessica and Mike nearly get impaled by an icicle, even though Jessica was sincerely sorry and Mike had nothing to do with it. If the player chooses to harm nature in every way (including the above situations), it's poor <em>Matt</em> who will have to deal with an aggressive deer despite not being involved in any of the earlier situations.

However, Eugene Snit from the Season 2 episode "Matchmaker" takes the cake. His girlfriend dumped him on Valentine's Day the year before, so he decide to get revenge by installing dating booths that helped him to gather information on a girl's ideal boyfriend in Beverly Hills High. He then used a holographic disguise device that allowed him to change into that ideal boyfriend. Then he seduced all the girls at Beverly Hill High and stood them up by not showing up to the dance to break their hearts. So instead of seducing his ex-girlfriend and breaking up with her to break her heart, Eugene decides to seduce and break the hearts of a bunch of girls that had nothing to do with his breakup. What made this worse is that he did not even go to Beverly Hills High; his school is the Institute for Gifted Teens.
