</div></div><p>Bond Villain Stupidity is a form of ignorance commonly exhibited by villains. It occurs when a villain fails to kill the hero when he has him cornered, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless, thus giving the hero a chance to escape and later come back to defeat the villain. This may occur as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithinArmsReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithinArmsReach">Within Arm's Reach</a> - where a character appears to be totally helpless in a fight but nevertheless manages to seize some advantage from something within arm's reach. Essentially, this is where having too much ambition backfires; they lose sight of the matter at hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">and turn their attention on all the wrong things.</a> It is so named because it occurs frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movies. A common form of Bond Villain Stupidity is to place the hero in an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> from which he can escape (slow dipping mechanisms over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharkPool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharkPool">pits of sharks, alligators</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcidPool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcidPool">acid</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit">lava</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningPit">simply water</a> are perennial favorites). If you ever asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">why the villains don't just shoot him</a>, <em>then</em> use their pets/lava to dispose of the body, congratulations! You are smarter than the average megalomaniac. Also common is the inability to resist a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">Just Between You and Me</a> moment before putting the hero in said death trap. Several variants of this one made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList">Evil Overlord List</a>.

I <em>don't</em> think we'll meet again... Goodbye!"

</p><p>Objective logic and villain hang-ups aside, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">the Doylist reason for this trope</a> is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsDramatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsDramatic">giving the hero an unceremonious, mundane death at the hands of the villain is very disappointing for the audience</a>; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped a Bridge on Him</a>.

</p><p>Note that there are several legitimate reasons why the villain may opt to let the hero walk away; if any of these are in play, this trope is not.

</li><li> The villain may just be looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">for a good fight</a> and considers the hero a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, opting to keep him around for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedYouStronger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedYouStronger">future entertainment</a>. In some cases, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">success of the scheme</a> is actually a secondary goal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">the fun of actually carrying it out</a>.
</li><li> The villain considers killing the hero secondary to breaking his spirit via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Breaking Lecture</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a>, etc.
<ul><li> Or perhaps the villain just can't bear the idea of killing the hero without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">flaunting his victory in the hero's face first</a>, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Rival Turned Evil</a>.

If the hero is killed some other way, then that benefit is lost. The villain may not even care at all about the hero, but about said benefit. For example, what a vampire really wants is the blood of his victims; he won't get anything if he vaporizes people with some futuristic giant laser gun.
</li><li> The villain wants to avoid being blamed for killing the hero, and thus sets up a situation where he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a> or produce an alibi for the time when the hero is supposed to die.

A recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> for many villains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> series is their refusal to just kill Bond in an easy, convenient, or practical way. It's gotten so ubiquitous with them that it's become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>. The antagonists in any <em>Bond</em> movie tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">gloat</a> about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plans</a>, but by then, 007 has already cooked up a plan B to escape and defeat the baddies. Examples in chronological order:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Dr. No</a></em>:
<ul><li> After a dinner goes wrong, Dr. No orders his guards to beat Bond up and imprison him. 007 naturally escapes. Arguably justified in that this was the first Bond film, so nobody knew how dangerous he could be.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrNo">the book</a>, he also had Bond run through Dr. No's death course. Bond was close to dying through it, multiple times. As did everyone else Dr. No had "tested"; the course was designed to kill. The only difference Dr. No ever expected was how long it would take. Funny how much difference a stolen lighter and a steak knife (and Bond!) can make...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove">From Russia with Love</a></em>, Red Grant's plan is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">just shoot Bond</a>, and he actually manages to get the drop on his target and have him completely at his mercy, but he still fails because he can't resist indulging in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">Just Between You and Me</a> speech. In Red's defense, he still would have been fine if he hadn't fallen for Bond's bribe. At least he didn't leave the guy unattended, unlike most of the jokers on this list.
<ul><li> He'd also had plenty of opportunities to kill Bond before he even got on the train, but his failure to do so was his superior's fault: Red's boss' boss (Blofeld in the movie, General G in the novel) didn't just want Bond to die, he wanted him to die in a manner that would embarrass MI6 and the British government, which required a more elaborate setup then just shooting him as he walked down the street.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted <em>and</em> played straight by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>. Audric Goldfinger was originally going to just have Bond sliced in half by a laser, but moments from loosing his manhood Bond himself points out that if he dies, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecretIntelligenceService">Secret Service</a> will just send in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">some guy called 008</a>. Goldfinger decides instead to keep Bond alive and trick his superiors into thinking Bond has the situation well in hand. This works, and Goldfinger's plan probably would have succeeded if Bond hadn't used the opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">charm</a> Pussy Galore.
<ul><li> In the same film, however, Goldfinger plays the trope straight in dealing with his gangster accomplices. While he is showing them his plan with an elaborate miniature Fort Knox, one gangster demands to leave and take his gold with him. They load the gold in a car and Oddjob drives him away, ostensibly to the airport. Oddjob kills him as soon as the gangster notices they aren't heading to the airport. Instead of just dumping the body, however he takes the car, with the body in it, to an auto yard where it is cubed. He then returns to the farm where Goldfinger says they will have to extract the gold from the car. The kicker is that, after that gangster left, Goldfinger had the room sealed and all the other gangsters gassed to death anyway. So why not just excuse himself for a minute, leaving that one guy with the others and kill them all at once as he had already planned to do, instead of destroying a car for no reason (and even then, why not just take the gold out of the car <em>before</em> making it a three foot by three foot cube, rather than <em>after</em>)?
</li><li> Notably, in the novel, the gangster who opted out of the plan "fell down the stairs" on his way out of the meeting, and the others all agreed to join the plan and were left alive, rather than the elaborate setup from the movie.

<ul><li> Fiona Volpe successfully seduces Bond - not that that's especially difficult to do - and doesn't do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High-HeelFace Turn</a>, but then monologues about it and generally screws around until Bond escapes, killing her shortly thereafter. Helga Brandt makes almost the exact same mistake a film later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">though she's instead killed by her superior for being a moron</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Largo himself provides a classic example. He catches Bond in his pool fighting with one of his men. The mook with him is just about to shoot Bond, but Largo stops him and instead traps Bond in there to be eaten by his sharks. Naturally, Bond uses this to escape.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice">You Only Live Twice</a></em>, Blofeld's guilty of it at least twice; first, he sends an assassin to kill Bond with an elaborate poison trick while he sleeps you know, instead of shooting him or dropping a grenade on him or any of the myriad other ways to kill a sleeping guy from roughly the same distance. Later, he catches Bond in his base, and keeps him alive because he wants Bond to witness his success even though he really ought to know better than that by now. He even pulls an elaborate fakeout where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy">he seems like he's about to shoot Bond, but shoots his own henchman instead at the last second</a>. A little while after that, he finally tries to shoot Bond for real, but of course by then it's too late with Tiger Tanaka stopping him with a well-aimed shuriken.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em>, where for once Blofeld actually has a sensible reason for keeping the captured 007 alive and explaining the plot to him: Bond as a government agent would be an external witness to his activities to verify his claims that he can actually release a "Virus Omega" and is not merely bluffing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys">Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd</a> had Bond unconscious and they simply dumped him in an unfinished pipeline and left, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere">assuming he'd eventually die</a>. Doubly stupid, as this was the <em>second time</em> the pair had been given an unconscious James Bond to dispose of; the first time they tried to burn him alive, which admittedly would have worked as he was only saved by other villains.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie">Live and Let Die</a></em> revolves around this, as the villains sequentially attempt an elaborate assassination involving a snake (despite having keys to his room), leave him unattended on a small island to be eaten by alligators, and finally try to have him fed to sharks - admittedly a classic - instead of just shooting him, despite by then having had enough experience with the guy to know better.

When he arrives there late at night, he's incapacitated by some guards in an ambush. As they're about to kill him, Hai Fat forbids them from doing so because he doesn't want Bond killed in his home. They'll just take him somewhere else to finish him off, right? Nope. Hai Fat has Bond placed in a krabi krabong school to... get beaten up. Scaramanga rightfully ridicules Hai Fat's thinking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before killing him</span>.
</li><li> Justifiably invoked by Scaramanga late in the film; he freely admits that he could have used his solar-powered laser to blow up Bond's plane before he even landed on the island, but chose not to do so because of how unsatisfying it would be. Scaramanga would like nothing better than to engage in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">a duel between titans</a>" with 007 himself.

Bond easily escapes and he frees the submariners and they fight back against their captors, eventually foiling Stromberg's hopes of instigating WWIII. Later, as Bond makes it to Atlantis to stop Stromberg and save Anya, Stromberg first tries to send Bond down a booby-trapped elevator into his shark tank, but Bond manages to avoid the trap. Later, Stromberg finally tries to shoot Bond himself with a special gun hidden beneath his dining table, and again, Bond avoids the attack and he finishes off Stromberg himself.

</li><li> The main villain is guilty of it as well, choosing to kill Bond and the Bond Girl by dragging them behind his boat and assuming sharks ate them when they finally disappeared as opposed to shooting them <em>before</em> throwing them overboard and then using the sharks to dispose of the evidence.

</li><li> Downplayed later on, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenegadeRussian">General Orlov</a> and Kamal have snuck a nuclear warhead into an US Air Force base in West Germany and have set it to detonate. After Kamal and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Gobinda</a> have left, they see Bond hurriedly driving to the base to try to prevent it from detonating.

<ul><li> Early on, Zorin decides to kill Bond by rolling his car into a lake, presumably to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a>, though, as Zorin does try to get it done while James is still unconscious and even stays at the lake long enough to make sure James couldn't have survived (James <em>does</em> survive by spotting that Zorin was watching and using the air from the tire to stay underwater until Zorin left).
</li><li> Later, Zorin has Bond at his mercy but decides to kill him by locking him in a museum and setting it on fire. Justified, however, in that he wants to frame Bond for the murder of someone else and make it look like he failed to escape after setting the museum on fire himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights">The Living Daylights</a></em> as the villain's whole plan hinges on Bond killing someone on his say so and his own ability to look like the victim and/or hero. He does miss a good opportunity to kill Bond late in the film, but it's because he thinks sending Bond to jail will be better for his cover - which he'd be right about, if Bond hadn't already outsmarted him a few scenes before.
</li><li> Almost averted again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill">Licence to Kill</a></em> as the villain doesn't find out Bond's not on his side 'till very near the end, and when he does put Bond into his death trap he sticks around to watch until he's forced to leave because the place is on fire and about to explode, at which point he leaves his number two man in charge of finishing the job. Naturally, that goes poorly for him, but credit to Sanchez for getting so much closer to getting it right than most.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, the villains have several opportunities to just shoot Bond and don't. Then Ouroumov has the chance to shoot Bond, <em>announces that he is about to do it</em>, and then is promptly cold-cocked. What moves this into beyond-belief territory is that <em>both</em> have direct evidence of how dangerous he is when cornered. The only such opportunity that has a justified reason for not killing him is in the Statue yard, where Trevelyan is trying to frame Bond and Natalya for the theft of the helicopter. If a post-explosion examination of the bodies revealed that they had been shot beforehand, it would have raised suspicion. Also, given Trevelyan's motivations, it's not merely enough to kill Bond, and if it would be he usually has more pragmatic reasons for keeping them alive. The aforementioned frame-up is just the first such example.
</li><li> Elliot Carver was preparing to do this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em>, leaving Mr. Stamper and his henchmen to torture Bond and Wai Lin for an ungodly number of hours before letting them die, but the heroes decide to make their escape before Carver even leaves the room.
</li><li> Zig-zagged by Elektra King in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em>. For most of the film, she averts the trope in that her aim is to seduce Bond into becoming her new Renard, rather than to kill him. When she <em>does</em> decide to kill Bond, however, she straps him to a torture chair that will slowly apply pressure to the back of his neck until it snaps. She is, admittedly, about five seconds away from succeeding when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Zukozsky intervenes</a>, but she <em>would</em> have succeeded if she hadn't stopped to gloat between each turn of the screw. What truly moves this into "stupidity" territory is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Zukovsky arrives, she pulls out a gun and shoots him, then instead of shooting Bond too, she <em><strong>drops the gun in front of him and runs away</strong></em>, in the delusional belief that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">wouldn't shoot a previous lover</a>. Even after she tried to kill him not ten seconds ago.</span> This ends about as well for Elektra as you'd expect.
</li><li> It's either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> or a spectacularly bad example, albeit not involving Bond himself: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em>, two henchmen have Jinx at their mercy, and one <em>actually proposes shooting her</em>... but the other one wants to do it with lasers, and gets his way, allowing Bond time to arrive and rescue her. Earlier in the film, Bond gets out a Bullet-Proof Vest and Colonel Moon keeps shooting it until it falls off into the ground.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale</a></em> Mr. White makes a dumb and wholly unnecessary deal to keep Bond alive. It ends poorly for him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>.
</li><li> Not quite averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace">Quantum of Solace</a></em>, as while the villains never really have Bond at their mercy the way they usually do at least once a movie, they do, however, leave the oft-imperiled Bond girl alive way too many times, and she ends up having as much to do with their downfall as 007 does.
</li><li> Raoul Silva in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> initially toys with Bond instead of killing him because it's all part of his plan to get caught so he can exact revenge on M. Later, however, his failure to take advantage of various opportunities to kill the heroes after said plan has already run its course is best chalked up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages">Sanity Has Advantages</a>.

<ul><li> First, when he has Bond at his mercy in his secret base, he just decided to go all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheBadass">Break the Badass</a> on both Bond and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGirl">Bond Girl</a>, and then he'd get to killing Bond after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> instead of instantaneously killing 007. This gives 007 ample time to bail out and conjure a plan to take down Oberhauser and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">C</span>.
</li><li> The second time, he constructs an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, giving Bond a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>: escape now on your own but live with the guilt of not saving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madeleine Swann</span> in time for the rest of your life, or try to rescue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Swann</span> and die together. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesAThirdOption">Takes a Third Option</a>, and he not only manages to save Swann in the nick of time, he also gives chase to Blofeld and has him arrested for his crimes.</span> In this case, Oberhauser was playing on Bond's feelings to get him to fall, but since he was more interested in tormenting Bond rather than killing him, this gave Bond plenty of time to find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Swann</span> and then escape.
</li><li> Oberhauser's henchmen aren't too bright either. When they kidnap Bond, they tie his hands in front of him, with plastic zip ties. Sure enough, Bond is able to grab one of their guns and shoot them both, then break free.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">C/Max Denbigh</a></span> himself is guilty of this, as he had many chances to kill M so he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">won't hinder his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> to seize control of the world's intelligence agencies and forward the collected intel to SPECTRE, but opts to go for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Break Them by Talking</a> near the climax.

<ul><li> During the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, in his fight against Goku during the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai, Tenshinhan, who was starting to feel overpowered by Goku's tremendous stamina and having several of his techniques outdone by Goku's very own, ingenuously decided that, if he could not knock Goku unconscious or push him out of the platform, he would simply destroy the entire platform; that way, Goku would lose by ring out because there would be no platform left to stand on. Tenshinhan, who possesses the ability to fly, did not have that problem. He managed to destroy the platform with his powerful Kikouhou, but instead of simply waiting for Goku, who had jumped very high to escape the blast, to hit the ground, he decided to fly close to him, accompanying Goku as he fell down, in order to gloat about his inevitable victory. That opened an opportunity for Goku to use one last attack that knocked Tenshinhan unconscious, and now both fighters were falling to the ground. Subverted because Tenshinhan, by a stroke of luck, actually won the fight, but he was likely in worse physical condition than Goku by the end of it.
<ul><li> In the manga he's a bit smarter; he intended to stay where he was and watch Goku fall, but Goku reacted quickly.
</li><li> For a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a>, Tao Pai Pai is pretty damn careless. After his first fight with Goku, he shoots him with a Dodonpa, seemingly killing him, but Tao Pai Pai doesn't bother to actually check Goku's body to make sure. Naturally, Goku is still very much alive, and while Tao Pai Pai is off doing other things, Goku trains with Karin to gain enough power to beat him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> has many examples of this:
<ul><li> Frieza shows that he completely outclasses Goku and the rest of the heroes while only fighting at 50% power and that he could kill all of them in an instant, and yet he toys with them and lets the fight drag on... until Goku transforms, that is. Frieza himself even lampshades the fact that he should probably just take Goku out right now after the 20x Kaioken, but he still keeps screwing around anyway. He lampshades it again after Goku transforms, kicking himself for not just killing Goku when he had the chance; by the time he realizes this, however, he has no hope of victory.
</li><li> During the Cell Saga, Vegeta, after having trained for a year in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Room of Spirit and Time</a>, powers up to <a class="urllink" href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Second_Grade">Super Saiyan Second Grade,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and becomes much, much stronger than his opponent, Semi-Perfect Cell. Rather than finish him here, Vegeta lets Cell absorb Android 18 and upgrade to his Perfect form, lusting for a greater fight. Cue Perfect Cell completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomping</a> Vegeta, and later Trunks. While Vegeta is on the good guys' side at this time, the effect is the same.
</li><li> Vegeta also indulged in this as a villain during the Saiyan Saga, when he decided to wait for three hours for Goku to return to Earth so he and Nappa could crush the hopes of Earth's warriors.
</li><li> Cell himself makes the exact same mistake. After ascending to his Perfect form, and defeating Piccolo, Vegeta, Trunks, and Android 16 in the process, he becomes the most powerful being on earth. Rather than kill everyone, he opts to give the Z-Fighters 10 days to prepare for a tournament.

</li><li> <em>Dragon Ball</em> generally inverts this trope almost as much as it plays it straight. The Heroes are just as prone to holding back in their fights or letting the villains go, just to result in them coming back stronger later. The worst offender is probably Gohan, who, due to not possessing the same natural fighting instinct and impulse control of the Saiyans and willing martial artists, has a problem with holding back too much during his fights due to some emotional or subconscious drive and giving the villains too many openings.

However, they can still have their souls sealed away or put to rest.

Being so powerful she never encountered a real challenge or situation where she wasn't free to do as she wished.

Why didn't Kiryu finish him off when he had the chance? He claimed it "wasn't the right time."

The initial plan was to trick her into eating an incredibly spicy Tatababasco berry disguised as a grape, which would make her collapse. But the plan didn't work well, to say the least; Sugar's toys found out about it, and in the ensuing confrontation ended with Robin becoming a victim of the power in an attempt to restrain Sugar, Usopp beaten up by Sugar's bodyguard Trebol, and the Straw hats' Tontatta allies beaten senseless. It would seem the heroes were, well, doomed. Until Sugar decided that, rather than use her power on Usopp (which she <em>usually</em> did to captured prisoners, and really had no reason to stop now) she would make him suffer, and force fed him the Tatababasco. It made Usopp make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake">Wild Take</a> to end all Wild Takes, scaring Sugar into submission and, while not the way they planned, knocked her out, doing the job anyway.

After stabbing Kirito into the ground, he's about to change the pain absorber, which, once it drops below level 3, starts affecting a user's body in the real world. Given that he was in complete control of situation and the world in which Kirito was trapped in, Oberon could've turned it off all the way on Kirito by setting the absorber to level 0 (or at least below 3) to ensure he will never have to deal with Kirito again in either the digital or real worlds. And if that happened, seeing Asuna in pain as Oberon rapes her would potentially inflict more pain and stress on Kirito and kill him in real life. Sugou wins, the end! Instead, being overconfident in his complete control of the situation, he sets it to level 8, insisting on gradually decreasing the levels to increase the pain to "give [Kirito] something to look forward to". Because of this, Kirito isn't completely dead, and gets help from Kayaba's digital spirit, who gives Kirito his admin status to turn the tables on Oberon by setting his in-game level to 1, and turning off the pain absorber on <em>Oberon himself</em>, then proceeds to kill him, thus, foiling Sugou/Oberon's plans. Even if Sugou had no way of foreseeing Kayaba's intervention, that still wasn't exactly a smart move.
</li><li> During midterms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, Mineta and Sero are put in a mock battle against the Pro Hero Midnight (playing the role of a villain the two have to subdue or escape past). Midnight knocks Sero out easily, but not before he slings Mineta out of range of her sleeping gas. Midnight admits she could just camp the exit until Mineta runs out of time and fails, but her sadistic streak rears up and she gives chase, giving Mineta time to regroup and trap Midnight for the win.

It turns out that The Blot does this because, despite being evil, he can't stand to actually see anyone get hurt, let alone die. So he constructs elaborate traps to kill Mickey for him, then always leaves because he can't bear to watch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <em>Knuckles Chaotix</em> special, the original Robotnik manages to successfully trap Sonic and all of the Freedom Fighters inside glass mirrors. However, Knuckles, who also fell into said trap, doesn't get trapped in a mirror. Instead, Robotnik takes away his special abilities (like his gliding and his spiked knuckles) just so he can still have someone to gloat over. Naturally, since Knuckles is still free, this gives him a perfect opportunity to build together a resistance to take him down. A minion even lampshades the obvious stupidity of this moment.
</li><li> Taken to extremes in one issue. Dr. Eggman decides he's sick of fooling around with Sonic and launches an all-out attack on his hometown. His forces manage to blast nearly every single good guy (except three) with powerful lasers that seem to vaporize them on contact. He then beats the crap out of Sonic for good measure. Looks like Eggman has finally won... except that those lasers didn't kill Sonic's friends, they were just teleport beams, which sent them all to cells at Eggman's HQ. Eggman announces he'll kill them all THERE even though he could have killed them much more easily by simply making his lasers lethal in the first place. This is doubly stupid because Sonic believes everyone is dead... until Eggman TELLS Sonic that his friends are alive, and where to find them. Then he's actually surprised when Sonic mounts a rescue and frees them all. If he'd just kept his trap shut, Eggman would have had plenty of time to kill everybody.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the first issue of the 1988 miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackOrchid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackOrchid">Black Orchid</a></em>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villain has the heroine at his mercy, and instead of sticking her in a deathtrap, he just shoots her. And then, having established that she's immune to bullets, he kills her with fire, and makes sure she's dead. The miniseries turns out to be about the heroine's sister dealing with the consequences of her death</span>.
</li><li> The Yellow Bastard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> was fine leaving Hartigan hanging by his neck and didn't stick around long to make sure he couldn't escape, which he did. To his credit, people typically die when they are hanged. Hanged people mostly die from breaking their necks. If one survives the fall, failing to suffocate is not common but very much possible. So it's more like a case of generic stupidity owing to lack of research on the subject than the Bond Villain kind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheExtremistVector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheExtremistVector">The Extremist Vector</a></em>: The Extremists have a pretty bad case. First, they did not kill the Silver Sorcerer after getting the spell from her, and sent her to Carny giving her a chance to escape. They defeated the Justice League, and let them be. They defeated them a second time, and sent them to Carny as well. In this case it's possible they were trying to avoid their earlier mistake which lead to them wiping out all life on a planet they'd intended to rule over.

<ul><li> Despite being a supergenius, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> falls prey to this a lot whenever he's trying to kill his hated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic">Reed Richards</a>. This is sort of justified though, because Doom's end goal isn't killing Reed  it's proving to Reed that Doom is smarter than him, and <em>then</em> killing him. Therefore, killing Reed without gloating about how he has been outsmarted and making him watch Doom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> and kill everyone Reed loves isn't just a tad disappointing to Doom  it would be completely antithetical to Doom's entire purpose in being evil.
</li><li> One of the biggest examples of this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> was done by the Frightful Four. Well, three of them; the Wizard, Trapster, and Sandman were, as usual, in need of a fourth member, something they never seemed able to hang onto. They managed to invade the Baxter Building, ambush the team and take the heroes hostage. So what do they do now that they have their foes at their mercy? Dispose of them? Engage in sadistic torture? Maybe hack into Reed's files? Nope. They use the Baxter Building to hold auditions for a fourth member, and force the heroes to watch. Unfortunately for them, most of the folks who showed up were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villains</a> and a few folks who were trying to decide between this and something more legit including Texas Twister (who rejected their offer because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> had offered better), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Captain Ultra</a> (making his first appearance here, likely what made the issue stand out most) but it <em>really</em> turned bad for the villains when Tigra - who was friends with the FF - showed up and saw the situation. She got them out, and when the Wizard announced over the intercom to everyone waiting that whoever helped them fight the heroes could join them, they proved smarter than he was - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">they ran for the exit.</a> (One villain, the Brute remained, and he ended up the fourth member, but like all other fourth members of the Frightful Four, he didn't last long.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DraculaVsKingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DraculaVsKingArthur">Dracula vs. King Arthur</a></em>, Dracula has Arthur captured and brought to Dracula where he could've easily killed him and took over the kingdom. But rather then doing the sensible thing to clinch victory, he instead decides to "break his will" and just have Arthur thrown into the ocean after his subjects and feed on him. As you can imagine not only does this not happen, but Arthur recovers, gains some new weapons from the Lady of the Lake and regroups his remaining forces for a final battle which ended in Dracula's defeat. Yeah, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">nice one, lord of the darkness.</a>
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Revival">Revival</a></em> our heroes are surrounded at gunpoint by US military. The commanding officer clarifies to <em>his own troops</em> that they have orders to kill, listens to and rebuts protests by the heroes, and counts down to coordinate the execution. The heroes' backup has plenty of time to show up and save the day.
</li><li> During the early days of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> comic books the villains had this trope BAD. Nearly every story involved the villains knocking out Captain America, Bucky, or both, then locking them in a cell or something before declaring that they're going to kill them now, only for Cap and Bucky to have escaped in the meantime. Naturally this results in the villains subsequently being beaten.

The only one he kills is the youngest and most inexperienced member.
</li><li> Justified in the same fashion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em>, where Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Harry Tasker is captured alive so that he can document for the authorities that the terrorists are capable of carrying out their threat, and afterward when they intend to torture him since he's an American spy who most likely has some valuable information in his head.
</li><li> Spoofed and lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a></em> movies, where Scott Evil is quite offended by Dr. Evil's insistence on dining with his titular arch-nemesis, instead of shooting him in the head on sight.
<ul><li> In the first movie, Dr. Evil has Austin and Vanessa Kensington on an "unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism" over a pit of mutant seabass. (He wanted sharks with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Frickin' Laser Beams</a> attached to their heads, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">his organization couldn't clear up the red tape</a>.) Right after that, Dr. Evil refuses to watch, just assuming that it's all going to go to plan. Scott lampshades the ridiculousness of it, saying that there's a gun in his room, and it would only take seconds to shoot them. Dr. Evil then remarks that Scott just doesn't get it.
</li><li> In the second movie, Dr. Evil has Austin and Felicity Shagwell over a pit of molten lava. Austin concocts a crazy scheme to try and escape, but Felicity just flashes her boobs at the guard, and they escape. Notably, soon after this, Dr. Evil does order his guards to just shoot Austin, but Austin kills them all first.
</li><li> In the third movie, Dr. Evil tries to kill Austin's father Nigel Powers with the classic "cutting in half with a laser beam" schtick, but it moves so slow that Nigel has time for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialogue">Casual Danger Dialogue</a>.

Moriarty decides to prove his superior intelligence and creativity by... using the exact idea that Holmes just came up with! He does at least stick around to watch the death trap in action, and prepares to shoot Holmes when he decides it's taking too long; but he waits a bit longer than he should have, and Watson rescues Holmes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a>.

Also, everyone believes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the stepmother is dead</span>, so no one would come looking for her later. Rather than just shooting Katrina, she decides to spend a lot of time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">summoning the Headless Horseman</span> to do the job, giving Katrina plenty of time to wake up and run away (though granted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the stepmother</span> is hardly concerned when Katrina escapes, probably as she figures she's dead soon anyway).
</li><li> Annoyingly present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em>, when after luring John Connor into the heart of its main base, Skynet sends a single unarmed T-800 to dispatch our hero. Yeah. In a base probably full of hundreds of killer robots with guns, Skynet decides to send ONE unarmed unit to kill the hero. And it doesn't bother to send more armed killer robots after the fight drags out, with Connor getting backed up by Cyborg Marcus. Somewhat justified that the T-800 <em>DID</em> manage to critically wound John and if Marcus hadn't volunteered for a heart transplant, John probably would have died. Skynet doesn't even seem concerned when the fight spills into the T-800 assembly line, where countless Terminator power cores (I.E. easily set off miniature nuclear devices) lay for the humans to jury rig into a bomb that will destroy the entire base if they manage to defeat that lone T-800 you sent to kill them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDragon">The Last Dragon</a></em>, media-obsessed villain Eddie Arkadian first plays this trope straight, stopping a minion from plugging the hero during a big staged fight because it would ruin "the show". But then at the end of the movie when the show is "over", he whips out his own gun, gives a short sneering speech about "all this kung-fu crap", and fires. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The hero catches the bullet in his teeth.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuigleyDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuigleyDownUnder">Quigley Down Under</a></em>, Quigley has rejected Marston's offer to hire him to kill the local aborigines. Marston has his goons beat him into unconsciousness. It would be easy to simply shoot Quigley in the head, bury him in a shallow grave, and tell the British soldiers that he went back to port. But that would mean the movie would only be a half-hour long, so Marston decides to have his men take him into the middle of the Australian desert and leave him to die of exposure. Inevitably, this backfires spectacularly. As if that wasn't enough, he captures Quigley AGAIN, decides he's going to beat him in an Old West style quickdraw, and gives the man a fully-loaded pistol. Fortunately, Quigley never much cared for pistols...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> has Superman incapacitated by Kryptonite and unable to get out of his swimming pool. Then he leaves him, expecting him to die - even though he just learned that his girlfriend's mother lives in the town that one of his bombs is about to destroy. Somehow, he does not see her betrayal coming. He does this <em>again</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>. He seems to think he's done a better job by actually shanking Superman with a Kryptonite shard and throwing him into the sea believing this time he would be as good as dead, but it just gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois</a> a chance to find and rescue him.
</li><li> In a non-lethal example, in the final face-off in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMile">8 Mile</a></em>, Papa Doc makes the grave, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">just plain stupid</a> mistake of letting B.

</li><li> After John's cover is blown in <em>Stone Cold</em>, the bad guys put him into a chopper (which is vital part of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>) where they plan to strap him with explosives and then drop him on unsuspecting cops below.

Batman even asks Bane in prison when he first woke up: "Why don't you just kill me?" to which Bane replies, "You don't fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment must be more <em>severe</em>." Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Talia</span> monologues at length to Bruce about how much better revenge is when it's done slowly, giving the heroes enough time to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">block her remote triggering of a nuclear bomb</span>.

Ultron himself is guilty of this at several points, most notably when he keeps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> alive just so he can monologue to her.

Rather than simply killing Harry after using his blood to regain his body, Voldemort not only has Wormtail cut him loose and give him back his wand, but insists on fighting him in a one-to-one duel and forbids interference from any of his Death Eaters, for no other reason than to prove, once and for all, that he is the stronger of the two. The final result of this is that Harry manages to escape and tell the world about his return (not that many people listen at first).

He has just betrayed Mara Jade by tricking her into revealing Talon Karrde's location, leading to his arrest by Imperials who will torture him if he doesn't hand over important intel, and then smugly mouths off to her face about it. Mara predictably goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">berserk</a> and attempts to attack Thrawn, at first physically then through the Force. Both of these fail, leaving Thrawn with the question of what to do with a still visibly enraged and always emotionally unstable Jade. Instead of killing her, he allows her to live, and lets her out of his sight aboard his ship before letting her go. Jade then predictably hacks into the computer network of Thrawn's ship, uses it to find Luke Skywalker, and saves him. The next one-and-a-half books can be accurately described as Jade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal">sticking it to Thrawn</a> which eventually leads to his plans collapsing and his death.
<ul><li> Thrawn had figured that she was in a hopeless situation; no one among her old smuggling associates would trust her. This was an error on his part; she was able to convince Aves (one of Karrde's trusted associates) to lend her a Skipray Blastboat and an ysalamir, which she used to retrieve Luke from Jomark (and confront the insane Jedi Master there). Once Thrawn realized his mistake, he was quick to take steps to limit the damage, but the measures (most prominently, the attempt to stop Karrde's escape in <em>Dark Force Rising</em> and the attempt to kill or discredit her in <em>The Last Command</em>) ultimately ended up being inadequate.

But in this case it's justified, since Edmund did not appear to represent any sort of threat personally, and she had a reasonable-seeming plan to use him to destroy her other enemies. She was in fact undone not by a flaw in her plan per se but by Divine mercy. As Aslan points out, her knowledge went only back to the beginning of Time. She was unaware of key things that happened before that. At one point she <em>is</em> about to kill him, realizing that he's no longer necessary to her plans, and in the middle of sharpening her knife when Edmund (currently tied to a tree) is rescued. The only reason the Witch initially kept Edmund alive was because she learned he had two sisters and a brother, fitting the prophecy that two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve would reclaim Narnia, and thus hoped to get all four dead or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">petrified</a> and be done with it. Her plan almost did work at one point, when the other three Pevensie siblings seriously gave thought to breaking into the Witch's castle to save Edmund, but were talked out of it by the Beavers. She finally gives up on the plan when the three Pevensie siblings reach Caer Paravel thus making their capture impossible, and realizes that simply killing Edmund would stop the prophecy from being fulfilled. By <em>that</em> point, the other assassins she'd sent to kill the children failed, and were used to track down and save Edmund.
</li><li> Most if not all of the villains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series fall victim to this. Probably the most egregious are the Volturi. In <em>New Moon</em>, the only reason they don't want to kill Bella is because she looks like she'll make for an interesting vampire. Instead of just biting her then and there and holding her captive to brainwash her into being a member of their guard (which <em>Breaking Dawn</em> says is what they want from her), they decide to let her go back to Forks, and according to Edward will probably forget about her for thirty years or so, giving the Cullens plenty of time to turn her on their own terms, or hide her. In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, their goal was apparently to use Renesmee as an excuse to kill the Cullens/force some of them to join the guard. Instead of quickly going to Forks and doing the job, they spend a full month heading over (thus giving Alice a chance to see it and warn the family) and bring a ton of witnesses, which means they have to put on a show of being fair and let the Cullens go. The witnesses aren't even necessary, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that the vampires generally accept the rule of the Volturi as right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crescendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Crescendo">Crescendo</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rixon</span> spends the entire book psychologically tormenting Nora, before getting ready to sacrifice her for a ritual. Given how she's unaware and unprotected for about 99% of the book, that he doesn't manage to pull it off is <em>really</em> astonishing. Nora even asks why he went through such an unnecessary and elaborate ruse instead of simply shooting her in the head while she was asleep. The only answer he gives is that the sacrifice is an important moment, and he wanted it to be enjoyable for him. He then kindly holds off on killing Nora while she asks him more questions about his plan, allowing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Patch</span> to conveniently show up and save her.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLeCarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLeCarre">John le Carré</a>'s spy novels, Karla (the brilliant and ruthless Soviet spymaster) knows how dangerous to his plans George Smiley is but does nothing about it. Even his mole "Gerald" admits as much after Smiley captures him. There are two more novels where Smiley defeats Karla again and again, even leading <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to Karla having to surrender himself to the West</span>. Karla could easily have assassinated Smiley but never did. He could have gotten away with it, even without a cover plan but (since Smiley had the most unfaithful wife in fiction) he could easily have made it look like a crime of passion like murder/suicide. However, Karla is not an active participant in <em>The Honourable Schoolboy</em>, and in both <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</em> and <em>Smileys People</em>, Smiley is retired and not a factor as far as Karla knows. In Le Carrés books, much like the real world (at least at the time) murder is a <strong>big deal</strong> and something that he would use only under desperate circumstances, such as those of <em>Smileys People</em>. Theres no good reason for him to try and have Smiley killed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity">Relativity</a></em>, a villain named Rasmas manages to trap all of the heroes in a typically elaborate deathtrap.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Florius manages to escape by taking Petro hostage and leaving him in a death trap so that the heroes must spend time rescuing him instead of pursuing Florius.

The Tleilaxu follow a code of honor that mandates that whenever they plan to kill somebody, they must always leave the victim some kind of opening to escape if only they're smart enough to notice it. This is due to their strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> beliefs, the logic being that if the victim is smart enough to escape the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, then they deserve to live.
</li><li> Many of the villains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a></em> series fall victim to this; Dr Grief plans to dissect Alex alive in a science class the following morning, giving him a window of opportunity in which to escape, Winston Yu hands him over to his snakehead to harvest his vital organs with similar results (albeit with the justification that Alex destroyed a large amount of extremely expensive equipment whilst attempting to escape, and this will allow Yu to recoup his losses), and Desmond McCain leaves him to be torn apart by crocodiles. However, Razim of <em>Scorpia Rising</em> (the final book in the series for many years, before writer Anthony Horowitz had a change of heart and decided to revive the series) manages to justify the trope in an unusual way: his plan not only requires Alex to be kept alive up until a certain point, it is <em>absolutely vital</em> that he is completely unmarked and unharmed until then.

He never realized, that under the influence of the <em>kindness</em> ray, his monster would be absolutely unwilling to harm anyone.
</li><li> Lampshaded and justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, when Taylor is teleported into a burning building, shot and left for dead while gunmen surround the building to make sure she doesn't get out. Afterwards, Taylor wonders why the villain responsible went to all that trouble when he could have just teleported her to a bomb and detonated it. Justified in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she asks Coil why he didn't do this, he admits that he tried to use a bomb repeatedly, and even teleporting her into a vat of acid, but the teleporter was built by Leet and went wrong whenever a bomb or acid was involved due to Leet's power actively sabotaging him, forcing Coil to keep changing the parameters of the scenario until he found a combination that wouldn't set off the inbuilt malfunction of the teleporter, and then Coil ran out of time due to the narrow window of opportunity and had to go with the burning building plan</span>.

At one point in the season, Jones Hodges manages to frame Jack Bauer for the death of a man he tortured by tasering, but could've just as easily killed Jack Bauer in the process. A bit of context: the incapacitated man was lying in the hospital bed recovering from the aforementioned torture when Jack Bauer sneaked back into the room (Bauer wasn't allowed to see him, but had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">interrogate him...again</a>).

</li><li> The explanation for the frequency of this happening in Victory Games's <em>James Bond 007</em> RPG is as a result of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">Surrounded by Idiots</a>.

</li><li> Many a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> villain will happily allow heroes to escape unharmed, only for it to come back and bite them later in the adventure. However, this is nearly always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, as the villain may be playing some elaborate game with both the heroes and their own lives or using the heroes as a distraction to cover up their own escape.

However, for the past 20 pages, there have been allusions to the idea that the leader of the vampires, Addison Payne, has a brilliant scheme to defeat the zombies at some point, even once captured. So instead of letting him live and risking utter victory just for the sake of torture, the lead zombie simply stakes him through the heart, no suggestion necessary. Despite this stroke of brilliance, he still winds up losing it all when he decides to keep one of the human women as his presumed concubine, and goes to embrace her, at which point she promptly stakes him in the heart, killing him and turning his zombies loose.

Instead, they just pass on a message that Chang has kidnapped the rest of the Teen Titans and will kill them if Robin interferes with Chang's plans.

</li><li> In one episode, Slade blackmails Robin into being his apprentice by infecting the other Titans with nanomachines that can kill them literally with a push of a button. Robin gets around this by infecting HIMSELF with the nanomachines, thus giving Slade the choice between killing all the Titans thus removing them as a threat but losing Robin as his apprentice, or potentially getting Robin as his apprentice at a later date, but leaving the Titans around to get in the way of his plans. Naturally as per this trope, he does the latter instead of the much more sensible former.

It started out like a good idea; Cobra Commander thought he'd attack the Joes' headquarters on Christmas Eve (worked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, right?) and it actually worked - he and his men took the whole team of Joes hostage. Then the Commander got a good idea, <em>maybe</em>. He had his men handcuff the prisoners and lock them up in their own meat locker, suspended from the hooks by their cuffs, then decided to take the Joes' vehicles for a joyride and attack a nearby city, maybe get the Joes in trouble. Then, however, Cobra Commander's last attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a> ruins the plan royally. He tells his prisoners he's leaving them a "Christmas present" and <em>puts the keys to their handcuffs on a hook by the door</em> before he leaves to taunt them, confident they can't possibly reach it. Unbeknownst to him, Shipwreck has already partially freed himself, getting down from the hook (he leaps up and grabs hold of it when they hear the Commander coming) so when the villain leaves again, freeing himself and the other is a simple matter. Even worse, when the villains leave with the Joes' vehicles, they <em>leave their own vehicles behind</em> (and apparently leave the keys in the ignitions, for that matter). Did the villains think the Joes wouldn't shoot down their own crafts? Wild Bill <em>did</em> say he felt "like [he] shot his own horse" when he did, but he still did, and so did the others. (So all this botched plan accomplished was to prove that C.O.B.R.A. can't claim that the Joes have better equipment as an excuse for their failures...)
</li><li> Ironically, during the five-part "Arise Serpentor Arise", when the villains took Sergeant Slaughter (likely one of the biggest thorns in their side) hostage, Cobra Commander was the smart one, wanting to kill him right away. Unfortunately for him, he had little control of the organization at the time, and Dr. Mindbender wanted to use Slaughter's DNA to supply the fighting expertise of his creation. It turned out <em>very</em> bad for them, and would be the biggest factor in the experiment creating just another failure of a leader.

</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em>. Wander realizes that the reason Lord Dominator keeps succumbing to Bond Villain Stupidity and letting the heroes escape is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">crippling loneliness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">an inability to connect with others</a>. She desperately seeks companionship but doesn't understand how to make it work, so she goes around bullying and dominating people as a supervillain, desperate to feel a connection. When her victims inevitably flee or fight back, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">she lets them do so</a> because that means she'll get to fight them more later</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> cartoon, Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters have several moments where he could easily have destroyed Mega Man and/or his friends, but fails due to opting for an excessively elaborate plan:
<ul><li> In "20,000 Leaks Under the Sea", after pulling off a clever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, he managed to trap our heroes in a fake laboratory building that was in fact an enormous robot which then took them underwater. We later find out that he had a self-destruct for the building that he could've just used right at the start to kill them all before they even realized anything was wrong. Instead, he trapped them in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam">Agony Beam</a> while gloating about his plan, eventually leaving them to their fate, enabling them to make their escape. Not only that, but he apparently left some tools behind that Dr. Light was able to use to help them escape.
</li><li> In "Showdown at Red Gulch" the Robot Masters had Mega Man completely at their mercy after they knocked him out, but instead of finishing him off, they tied him to a horse and sent him off into the desert.
</li><li> In "Campus Commandos" the Robot Masters had Mega Man at their mercy, twice. The first time they locked him in a closet and the second time they tied him to gears in a clock and left him alone.
</li><li> In "Brain Bot" they handcuffed Mega Man to the floor and were going to crush him, but left him alone instead of staying to make sure he died.

<ul><li> Allegedly, the Emperor Nero tried to kill his own mother firstly by rigging the ceiling above her bed to collapse on her as she slept (the idea never got past the planning stages), then settling on rigging her boat so that it would sink with her on it — this worked, but Nero didn't count on his mother being able to swim. When he heard that she had survived, with two elaborate death traps having failed him, he decided to have the messenger arrested and framed as an assassin, then just sent his guards to stab her to death.
