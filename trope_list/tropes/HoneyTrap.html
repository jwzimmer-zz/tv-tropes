Usually female, sometimes even a heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a>, the uniting thread is that there is one target and this one target is to be seduced.

Then the pictures are sent to the man with a demand for money; no money, and the wife gets sent copies of everything.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> franchise has had a few of these, including Bond doing it himself on a couple of occasions.
<ul><li> The most notable example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove">From Russia with Love</a></em>, where the aim of SPECTRE is to kill Bond and embarrass MI6.

</li><li> The KGB and Stasi used this method - in fact, the KGB even had a special school of seduction (or so the rumour went) to train agents.Well, they tried to use this method anyway. With mixed results. For instance
<ul><li> Sometimes the targets gleefully enjoyed the, errr, "ministrations" of the ladies in question while not giving up secrets. Often people who were warned. Or did not have as much information as thought.
</li><li> They were, however, often pretty successful in targeting the secretaries, wives, and daughters of Western officials and personnel. Women who would have access to information. They were, curiously, unable to repeat the success to the same level against male aides of such people. The fact that women are more susceptible to traps of this kind (contrary to popular and conventional views) has also been noted by other agencies. It was likely due to noone expecting women to be targets at all, or if so, weren't expecting them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">fall for it</a>.
<ul><li> The most common theory is that women are usually on their guard against men hitting on them, so if an agent managed to get past that, they were a lot more open. While in the case of men, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchlubPubSeductionDeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchlubPubSeductionDeduction">the fact that a girl well out of their league was paying them such rapt attention raised alarm bells.</a>
</li><li> One alternative theory is that the reason this has been observed is since men were specifically warned about the chances of this happening while the women were not.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Defense contractors and other firms handling sensitive or classified data warn their employees about this very clearly. They will put up conspicuous workplace posters that say, in effect, "If she's a 10 and you're a 2, be careful." They also constantly warn employees, that disclosing sensitive information could get them not just fired, but serious prison time.
</li><li> A method used by men to force women into prostitution is to seduce the woman, and then use the established relationship to press her into prostitution with emotional blackmailing. A variant, used by pedophiles, is to initiate cybersex via Skype, and then use the data material to blackmail the teenager into doing more and more explicit things in front of the webcam.
</li><li> In the '50s, the KGB wanted to gather blackmail material on Indonesian president Ahmed Sukarno. They had a group of young women pose as stewardesses on his flight, then take him back to his hotel room for an orgy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire">It didn't go as expected</a>: When the KGB showed Sukarno the film, he thanked them for a lovely night <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/kgb3.html">and asked for a copy of the film to take home with him.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Murder victim Bobby Kent went out with his "friends"/killers because he was promised sex with one of them.
</li><li> Luring gay men down to Africa and then blackmailing them (because homosexuality is very illegal in most countries) is a common form of romance fraud.
</li><li> Honey traps were one of the most common missions for female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> or <em>kunoichi</em>. They would be sent to seduce an important target, and either interrogate him via pillow talk, use the threat of revealing the thing to blackmail him, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">assassinate him during or after the deed</a>. <em>Kunoichi</em> were trained, like all ninja, in the creation and use of a wide variety of drugs and poisons, and many were trained in the use of a special kind of concealed dagger<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ddct');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ddct" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ddct');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">hidden as a ring</span>, making them deadly assassins even when naked.
</li><li> Similarly, in ancient China, beautiful women were often sent as peace offerings — even if they didn't act as spies, they often did at the very least distract their targets from their usual duties and inspire jealousy among the other men (and women) of the court. (It's why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems">The Thirty-Six Stratagems</a> advises the utility of such women.)

</li><li> In the '70s and '80s, the Children of God got their female members to use a method called "Flirty Fishing" which means using their sexuality - anything from flirting to full sex - to convert men to the cult. They kept exact records of their "fruits" (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been "fished". The cult also used Flirty Fishing to curry favours with local men of influence such as businessmen, politicians or police.

</li><li> One very bizarre incident involved Frenchman Bernard Boursicot, who attempted to woo Chinese opera singer Shi Peipu, who also happened to be a spy for China and convinced him to engage in low-level spying for the Chinese government; only for (several years later) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">Peipu to be revealed to be male</a> and the child that was supposedly fathered by Boursicot having been purchased from a doctor. This incident ended up inspiring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly">M. Butterfly</a></em>.
</li><li> Rose O'Neal Greenhow. She was a Southern socialite and spy for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. She was hugely successful because men seemed incapable of refusing her anything. On multiple occasions, she seduced Union officers and politicians to where they were willing to betray their duty (and left a few suicides in her wake).
</li><li> A young woman Nancy Michelle Mendoza stood trial for entrapping wealthy businessmen this way for a San Diego gang to hold hostage.
</li><li> During the investigation into the horrendous murder of single mother Rachel Nickell, London cops tried to frame up a local man called Colin Stagg, their preferred and only suspect. The problem was, while Stagg was undoubtedly the sort of oddball loner with a slightly tarnished past who <em>might</em> have graduated to sex murder, nothing tied him to the crime, he had an alibi, and he repeatedly refused to confess, even under heavy pressure. So a WPC was recruited to be a "whore for the law" and to befriend him, first by mail and then in person, and to do all it took to get him to confess. Stagg was convicted of the horrendous murder on very dodgy evidence. This echoes police practice in the Barry Bulsara case, where another loner oddball was fitted up for the murder of TV presenter Jill Dando. A lot easier to frame a local oddball than to go out and find the real killer, eh, Met? Unfortunately for the Met, an appeal court threw out the charges against Stagg and he received compensation for false imprisonment.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatNorthernWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatNorthernWar">The Great Northern War</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex">Charles XII</a> of Sweden overran Saxony and decided to keep his army there for a year of rest. The Elector of Saxony<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5p0vg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5p0vg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5p0vg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">incidentally also King of Poland, another place the Swedes were hitting pretty hard</span> sent his Swedish-born mistress to meet the King at his headquarters, hoping she could induce him to end the war and get out of the Elector's land. Charles absolutely refused to see her.
</li><li> In a minor scale, it's not uncommon for some thief gangs to have pretty women as their members - with the specific "mission" to distract male victims while the others rob them silly.
</li><li> In the old Soviet Union, there was a division of the KGB known as the "Sparrow School" that would train female agents to use sexual manipulation for information gathering purposes.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AugustoPinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>'s dictatorship in Chile, it's said that there was a group known as the "Brigada Rosa" (Pink Brigade), made of female celebrities who would use sexual favors to get information for the CNI (the dictatorship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>, whose top agent Alvaro Corbalan had ties with the local jet set).
</li><li> Used in the assassination of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">the Red Prince</a>", Ali Hassan Salameh. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mossad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mossad">Mossad</a> knew about Salameh's love for women and sent an agent posing as a British national who was working for the British-based arms of welfare organisations supporting Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The agent supposedly started an affair with Salameh to gain his trust. This eventually led to Salameh's assassination by detonating a car outside the agent's apartment as his convoy drove by.

</li><li> The sisters <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/teenager-nazi-armed-resistance-netherlands-876?utm_source=vicenewsfb&amp;utm_medium=vicenewsfbuk">Freddie and Truus Oversteegen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">of the Dutch Resistence</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and they specifically flirted with Nazis to then kill them as soon as they lowered their guards.
</li><li> This was echoed in the early stages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a> when British soldiers on local leaves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StrokeCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StrokeCountry">Stroke Country</a> were seduced by girls pretending to be from sympathetic parts of Northern Ireland. When the girl got the lonely squaddie "home", he ran into Provisional IRA terrorists who shot him, having used her as bait. British soldiers were ever after warned about this sort of thing. The tactic has also been used by Protestant terrorists, angry about having their legitimate and understandable right to chastise their Catholic neighbours being constrained by unsympathetic security forces: in this case humiliation rather than murder was the objective.
</li><li> The Taliban used young boys as honey traps against the Afghan police. The Afghan police refused to give up their boy lovers.
</li><li> As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FidelityTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FidelityTest">Fidelity Test</a>, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">clingy jealous girls</a> will have their hot friends attempt to seduce their boyfriends. If the seduction attempt succeeds, things could get dramatic. Even if they pass, the boyfriends could get quite angry that their partner didn't trust them.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Special Operations Executive would use 'decoy girls' to chat up trainees to see if they were vulnerable to this approach. If the trainee revealed anything about their secret work, they failed.
</li><li> Fear of this technique being used on gay men during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a> prompted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to screen them out of the Canadian civil service using the "Fruit Machine" - a device that supposedly tested whether a man was gay by measuring pupil dilation when exposed to photos of nude men.
</li><li> The <em>Heidi and Frank</em> radio program in Los Angeles had a recurring segment called "Put Your Man Where Your Mouth Is" in which women would volunteer to have model Dani Matthews flirt with their boyfriend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">test his fidelity</a>. Several days later, Dani would appear on the show and tell the story of how she approached the man and gave him the number of a burner phone. The hosts would then check the phone to see if the man had left her a message, thus failing the fidelity test.
