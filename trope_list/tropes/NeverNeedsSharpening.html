<ul><li> Juicero:
<ul><li> The "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oHp-VvhDE">Making Juice is Easy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" ad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket">went to great lengths</a> to make the old juicing method of "buy produce, wash it, chop it up, put it in a juicer, enjoy your juice, and then clean the juicer" seem hopelessly difficult before introducing the simpler Juicero. This is because the Juicero was a "juice press" that could <em>only</em> produce juice from expensive ($5 USD at minimum) pre-made packets (you couldn't even use your own produce if you wanted to) that only last a few days and were demonstrated to be able to be squeezed out just as effectively <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lutHF5HhVA">by hand<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as with their $400 device.
</li><li> The device needs to connect to your wifi and sync with an app on your phone to read the QR code on the bag before you can put the pack in the machine and have it press your juice into your cup in minutes. Yes, they put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DigitalRightsManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DigitalRightsManagement">DRM</a> on <em>juice</em>. This annoying "feature" was described as practical and as a way to prevent using out-of-date or recalled packets, but in practice was simply forcing the use of the brand's subscription-based packet delivery, with the cheapest options (5 packets a week, using the cheapest flavors) still coming out at over $1600 a year and preventing use of any potential cheaper alternatives.
</li><li> Another commonly-mentioned claim was that the Juicero could press with up to four tons of force. This is because the Juicero had a pretty massive design flaw: the press it uses is very wide, and it distributes the force evenly across that press. If it pressed down over a smaller area, it would need only a fraction of the force and get similar results—hence why people found they could press juice out with their fingers. Essentially, they were advertising the fact that their device was so inefficient that they needed custom-machined parts to squeeze out a cup of juice.
</li></ul></li><li> Dysons:
<ul><li> An infomercial contained a testimonial from a young man who looked to be about thirty years old, stating that "every Dyson he'd ever owned" worked great. He was on his fifth Dyson and he loved it. Sounds like a great testimonial, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">think about it for a moment</a>: a thirty-year-old man who has owned five vacuums must be replacing his vacuum every <em>two years</em>. This is not a mobile phone or a laptop that needs to be upgraded regularly because newer versions are explicitly faster and more powerful; it's a vacuum, the exact same model as the last one. All it does is suck up dirt. There is no reason to buy a new one unless the old one breaks down and can't be repaired. A vacuum costing what a Dyson does should last between twenty and thirty years. So <em>why is this guy on his <strong>fifth</strong> vacuum by the time he's hit 30</em>?
</li><li> Dysons "never lose suction!" as long as you don't overfill them (which admittedly is user error, as the dirt tank is see-through for this very reason). There is nothing but "cyclones of air" protecting the motor vents; if you overfill, then dirt will suction directly onto and into them.

Not to be outdone, a just-as-clever pink salmon company started advertising with the tagline "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsbestosFreeCereal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsbestosFreeCereal">No bleach added in processing</a>."
</li><li> A commercial for a brand of tea touts the health benefits of drinking more water, then lets its viewers know that women who drink their tea get more water than those who drink the leading brand. How one brand of tea can <em>contain more water</em> than another is left as an exercise to the reader. Perhaps anyone who drinks their tea feels the need to wash it down with water afterwards. If it's bottled tea, as opposed to bags or an instant tea mix, it is presumably rather diluted.
</li><li> The Orangina drink had an unfortunate habit of separating out into two unappealing looking layers. Hence its advertising slogan "Shake the bottle, wake the drink".
</li><li> Some boxed chocolates come with the candies still in the plastic factory moulds. This is not announced on the packaging (nobody wants chocolates they have to squeeze out of moulds) but is touted as "stay-fresh" on the inside of the box. Very embarrassing if given as a gift.
</li><li> Some cheaper beers have began to market the fact that they use clear glass bottles and countless more certainly exploit the aesthetic without making any claims about its superiority. After all liquors are usually stored in a clear bottle and doesn't that clear glass look so nice? Except beer can be damaged by ultra violet rays, to the point it will eventually smell like a skunk. As neat as clear glass looks, it's actually cheaper than colored glass. Thus most decent manufactures will use brown or green (if they feel fancy) glass but it doesn't stop cheap beer manufactures from marketing the pure clear glass their product is contained in.
</li><li> A flyer for Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches proudly touts that they only deliver within five minutes of the store as a feature to keep your food fresh and get it to you fast, but what this claim <em>actually</em> means is that the only people who can get delivery are the ones for whom in-store carry-out would be the most convenient.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Gambling </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Atlantic City casinos are advertised as 'the place where the most winning is done'. The odd wording intentionally masks that despite how much 'winning' is done, there isn't a margin of profit from the wins. If they are merely boasting exceptionally high player traffic, it may also be accurate to say those casinos are the place where the most <em>losing</em> is done. And here's an alternative interpretation: they never say that the winning is being done by the <em>customers</em>.
</li><li> Some lotteries — namely scratch-offs higher than five dollars — advertise that winning is guaranteed. They fail to mention that the vast majority of the prizes are under the sales price of a ticket, so most "winners" make a net loss.
</li><li> The UK's Premium Bonds scheme — a combination of bonds and lotteries, where instead of a small but regular dividend, the reward is the chance to win a (possibly huge) prize each month — was once advertised as "you never lose your stake". Some commentators pointed out that this was false, since your "stake" is not the money you paid for the bond (which indeed you can regain by cashing-in the bond at any time) but the dividend you would have earned if it had been a regular investment bond.
</li></ul></div>
<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Kitchen Gadgets </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Any kitchen implement that "cleans up in a snap - a quick rinse and you're ready to go!" is probably not dishwasher-safe. If it were, they'd say "just stick it in the dishwasher and you're ready to go!" One review on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> of the Ove-Glove specifically points out that if you get the glove dirty enough that it needs to be washed, there's not much you can do - water alone won't remove any grease stains, and the glove falls apart in the washing machine.
</li><li> The Pasta Pro, a big pasta pot with a lid that doubles as a colander, proudly advertises that the lid locks on tight so you won't scald yourself due to the lid falling off. Sounds like a great idea — one less dish to wash — but some reviewers have reported that the lid isn't "locking on" so much as it's <em>warping</em>. It sticks so badly that it won't come off when the pot is hot. Of course, attempting to pry the lid off carries a very high risk of burns. Other manufacturers have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">improved upon</a> the idea with better results.
</li><li> Eggies were designed to eliminate the difficult and time-consuming task of peeling hard-boiled eggs. It's true that pouring raw eggs into individual plastic molds and boiling those does eliminate peeling, but oiling and assembling each Eggie by hand (each is made up of four fiddly little pieces), getting the raw eggs through the small holes on the top of the Eggies, and cleaning them afterwards takes twice the time that peeling the eggs would have. Reviewers also found that the Eggies aren't really nonstick (you have to wipe each individual piece with an oil-soaked paper towel before assembling them), plus they leak egg white into the water, meaning the user has to scrub out the pot. Dang, if only eggs <em>came</em> in waterproof, individual cases...<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gw5f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gw5f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gw5f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Apparently, the people who invented this had never heard of egg coddlers.</span>
</li><li> Another device that was trying to get funded at the time of the Juicero disaster, was "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2e1x5IaO7k">SMALT - The World's First Interactive Centerpiece and Smart Salt Dispenser<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". No, your eyes are not deceiving you. An internet connected salt shaker/dispenser with companion smart phone app. Rather than play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket">Too Incompetent to Operate a Blanket</a> route, they instead take it in the opposite direction by bragging about all neat features it has compared to your average container of table salt. The average container of table salt that most people can use to season their food in less time than it takes to pull out their phone, turn on the app, select the dispenser setting and amount, set the mood lighting color, and have a conversation about the device that the company behind it advertises that it wants you to have with your dinner guests. Yes, really. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">Now we don't have much room to talk here</a>, but if this device is the highlight of your dinner table conversations, then you may want to re-examine the choices in this life that you've made that has brought you to holding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">riveting conversation</a> about a freaking <em>salt shaker</em>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Knives </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The granddaddy of all such products was the Ginsu Knife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">which was advertised as "never needs sharpening".</a> The implication was that they never went dull, which was only technically true - most Ginsus broke or rusted <em>long</em> before they dulled. And if they did last long enough to go dull (about a year), they were so heavily serrated that they literally <em>couldn't</em> be sharpened, or at least not without much more difficulty and expense than simply buying a new knife.
</li><li> Miracle Blade uses the same phrase for the same reason. They also spin the thinness of the blade in an attempt to muddle the concepts of sharpness and thinness in viewers' minds. Chef Tony can slice food more thinly than you can because he's more experienced and practiced doing that for the routine, not because his knife is thinner than yours. Thin blades wear out more quickly and can even snap during use, sending shards of sharp metal flying around the place and possibly into your food (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">if not worse places</a>).
</li><li> Ceramic kitchen knives also fall under this category. Depending on the quality of the ceramic used, they can very easily shatter, especially when attempting to flatten something using the blade turned sideways (garlic cloves are often prepared this way), though the packaging and/or the care instructions usually mention that you really shouldn't be using it for tasks that require lots of bending (like cutting cheese or smashing garlic cloves) or going through bone. The cutting edge can also be easily chipped and nicked. It's not that they never need sharpening, but that <em>they can't be sharpened</em>, at least not without a diamond-impregnated grinding wheel that's difficult to find outside of a machine shop, though better manufacturers will provide sharpening services on their blades for a small fee (usually shipping plus a minuscule labor charge).
</li><li> For cheap pocket and/or utility knives, it's not uncommon to see "surgical steel" used as a selling point. Obviously, the intended takeaway is that the knife is great because it's made from the same type of steel as a surgeon's scalpel, but savvy buyers know to steer clear of these knives because a scalpel is strictly used for the low-torque job of cutting soft tissue, and most modern scalpel blades are designed to be single-use and disposable. As such, they use very inexpensive, brittle steel; not the sort you'd want any practical utility knife to be made from.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Media </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> After the Internet and news media exploded over a bad case of research failure on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a>'s quiz show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MillionDollarMoneyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MillionDollarMoneyDrop">Million Dollar Money Drop</a></em>, FOX promoted the show saying "the airwaves and Internet were on fire" and that it was "the most talked-about show of the season." They intentionally neglected to point out that most of that talk was either "How did your writers come up with the wrong answer to a question when it takes one minute to look up the answer online?" or "Why are you stalling with five minutes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">padding</a> when it takes one minute to look up the answer online?"
</li><li> Murder mystery reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whodunnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whodunnit">Whodunnit</a></em> did something similar, proclaiming in its finale that it had generated a lot of internet buzz. But that buzz centered around viewers that thought the show was actually killing contestants instead of just fake-killing them, and the show was unremarkable otherwise.
</li><li> The advertising for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">MST3K</a>-riffed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeginningOfTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeginningOfTheEnd">Beginning of the End</a></em> proclaimed loudly how "No stop motion animation was used to create the giant grasshopper effects!"... when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slurpasaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slurpasaur">zooming in on regular-sized grasshoppers climbing over photographs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">works about as well as you might expect.</a>
</li><li> Any fan-books, photo-guides, or biographies that proudly announce that it is "100% Unauthorized". Meant to imply that it'll have juicy details that celebrities don't want you to know, more likely it's that the publishers didn't want to pay any residuals that might allow them access to any information or pictures not available through a quick Google search, while at the same time, being inoffensive enough not to draw any actual legal action.
</li><li> Similarly, a film advertised as "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition">Unrated Edition</a>" or "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut">Director's Cut</a>" might have saucy material too risque for theaters... or it might have five minutes' worth of deleted scenes no more or less extreme than what was already in there tossed back in, but the distribution company didn't want to go to the trouble to send the almost-identical new version back through the MPAA ratings process.

</div></li><li> Manufacturers add tingling agents to acne and dandruff medications mainly because consumers expect these products to tingle. Unfortunately, tingling is a sign that the product is irritating the skin and, in the process, making the underlying condition <em>much</em> worse. Menthol is by far the most common culprit.

</li><li> Some generic pills boast that their bottles have "easy-to-open caps". This is basically a fancier way to say that they couldn't afford to give their bottles the child-proof caps (which need to be pushed down at the same time as they are turned, making it harder for unsupervised kids to get the bottle open and potentially overdose on the drugs inside) that brand-name versions often have. This is a legitimate benefit, however, for a medically impaired consumer without small children in the home (e.g. senior citzens or sufferers of arthritis), who would otherwise have an extremely difficult time opening a childproof cap.

<ul><li> Sellers of leather product often advertise their products as having "genuine leather." It's easy to believe that genuine leather is a mark of quality indicating the product is made from real leather. However, genuine leather is a specific grade of leather, and it's actually the lowest quality of all animal leathers, apart from bonded leather. They make it by artificially finishing the top of low-quality leather to make it look and feel like high-quality leather.
</li><li> The term "top-grain leather" can be confusing to some. One might assume that "top" means "best", but it actually means it only uses the top of the hide (the other half is turned into suede). While top-grain is still higher quality than the aforementioned "genuine leather," the highest quality grade of leather is full-grain leather, which uses the entire hide.
</li><li> Natural fiber yarns are dyed in "lots". Knitters have to be careful that all the yarn they buy for a specific project is from the same dye lot or there could be a noticeable difference in colour after washing. Manufacturers of cheap scratchy acrylic yarn are now advertising that their product is superior because it has no inconvenient dye lots. That's because acrylic isn't dyed per se: the manufacturers simply add the dye to the petrochemical goo they make the yarn from. Also, in some cases, no-dye-lot yarn is still dyed in lots: the manufacturer just doesn't bother to keep track of them. Hope you like your blue sweater with one green sleeve.

</div></li><li> The Highland Titles website assures potential buyers of a "souvenir plot" in the Scottish Highlands that their purchase does not need to be registered. It doesn't say that this is because the Scottish Land Registry does not consider this to be a genuine sale of land, and that legally, the plot remains with Highland Titles.
</li><li> The Laphroaig distillery does a similar gimmick, but are cheekily up-front about the purpose: After "registering" your plot, customers are welcomed to visit the distillery and claim their "ground rent" of a free dram of whiskey.
</li><li> The International Star Registry runs a similar scam, offering to name a star for your loved one and record the name in the Library of Congress for posterity. They really will do that for you, because the Library of Congress couldn't care less either way; so long as you pay the requisite fee, you could rename every star in the galaxy "Soiled Underpants" and register it with them if you wanted, but it would have no bearing on what the International Astronomical Union officially designates as a star's name. To their credit, the Star Registry website <em>does</em> admit as much if you poke around in their FAQ.
</li><li> Timeshares. Many an infomercial will tell you that the way to get rich is to buy and resell timeshares. What they don't tell you is, having a timeshare isn't <em>exactly</em> like owning real estate. What you're literally buying is time at a resort (touted as a "share" of the property), not anything tangible - think of it less as having a vacation home and more as having a guaranteed reservation at a resort. So they don't appreciate in value the way that homes do; if you later resell that timeshare you bought, you will <em>almost certainly</em> do so at a loss. Also, you may not get to choose the week you want, depending on the resort, and if you fail to keep up with the maintenance fees (which are set by the resort, and not subject to any caps or restrictions, meaning they can go up at any time), you could be on the hook for the entire cost of the unit if you were actually buying it as a condo or house. That's not to say don't <em>ever</em> buy one; they <em>can</em> be a good investment in the kind of things money <em>can't</em> buy, such as happy memories and time spent with people you love at a place you love, and they <em>can</em> be good for people who would like to have a vacation home but don't want to deal with the expense and maintenance of buying and maintaining a second or third home. But they are <em>not</em> a good monetary investment, and they have a lot of fine print you need to be aware of before you buy one.

<ul><li> Any game that claims "X Hours of Gameplay!" but falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">Fake Longevity</a> under closer scrutiny. Parodied on the box of some versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> (one playthrough of which is about the length of a feature film in a bid to avoid that problem) which claims some overly specific three-digit number of hours of gameplay.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Open-world games</a> that make a big deal in advertising about how big their sandbox is also usually fall under this. The implication they <em>want</em> you to take away is something like "we had so many ideas to put in the game that the map can't possibly be any smaller than this". What more often seems to be the case is that the size of the map was set in stone in the first meeting, simply to one-up whatever game from last year had the previously-largest playable area, <em>before</em> actually thinking up anything to fill it with - ending up with an impressively-massive game world that's a chore to navigate and, outside of the city you begin in and some pre-placed enemy encampments, is almost entirely boring and lifeless. <br/><br/>This problem goes back to at least 1984, and <em>Xavior</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">Spectrum</a>; the blurb boasted "4,096 screens" and "32 great level designs", carefully omitting to mention that these two combined meant that (1) all those screens looked pretty much the same and (2) slogging through them rapidly became a chore. It thus took over 20 years for the game to finally be completed — and for it to be discovered that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">the end-game routine doesn't work</a>.
</li><li> Commercials for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP Go</a> touted "download-only" as a selling point. What this means is that the PSP Go lacks a UMD drive: if you "upgrade" to a Go, then your entire existing PSP library is useless, apart from whatever games you've already bought for download. In addition to forcing you to buy your physical games a second time, the vast majority of PSP titles never became available as downloads, leaving... unauthorized firmware as your only option to play them on a Go.
<ul><li> Compounded by the use of Memory Stick Micro (M2) which only went up to 16 GB max in cards released, same as the internal storage of the console, despite theoretically able to have up to 2 TB with the XC standard used elsewhere in the Memory Stick range, which would limit the amount of games you could store on it and the console, meaning that even if you got games ripped from UMD as implied above, you may not be able to store your whole library on both console and card.
</li></ul></li><li> In the world of software, you might hear the phrase "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" or "unintended feature." Though occasionally there are actual features which some people misinterpret as bugs. For instance, a clunky interface may be organized better in an update, which is good for most people but bad for the old-school types that already memorized the clunky version. The latter group may complain of a "bug" that changed the interface. Anyone who has ever worked in computer tech support can tell you stories of people complaining of bugs or "bad hardware" that was simply caused by one option incorrectly set in a program. Sometimes the "bug" you experience is the computer doing <em>exactly what you told it to do</em> without understanding <em>precisely</em> what you asked it to do.
</li><li> Procedural generation in general gets a lot of this. For instance, some games tout that their levels are procedurally-generated from playthrough to playthrough, meaning that every time you play the game again, you'll have a new level to explore that's unique to you. What this actually means most of the time is "this game's levels were created by a random number generator, meaning either that they're so bland and samey that even a computer couldn't screw up making them, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">the computer did screw up</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">the game is now unwinnable</a>." Most often, it refers to survival games that randomize the locations of their resources - this is technically a new experience, yes, but the only real effect it has on gameplay is that you can't look up where to find specific items online (but can still look up where items will appear in general). Two specific examples:
<ul><li> A big fuss was made about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> before its release regarding it "always having something new" so you can "play it forever" because of its procedurally generated worlds and player-made content. In the released version, the procedural generation does not have any tangible effect on gameplay, so "playing forever" really just entails doing the same things over and over again as you would in any other game, but with different models and a lot less depth than others like it so as not to risk doing anything with those models that the spline system couldn't handle well. Yes, you could play it forever and always see new things... but they never promised that doing so would be <em>fun</em>.
</li><li> A similar can of worms was opened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> touting the exact same thing.... and having the exact same result.
</li></ul></li><li> A trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheRobots">Rise of the Robots</a></em> boasts about the game's allegedly complex AI. All the points it made about the AI learning and adapting to its opponent turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>, but the mention of the computer "reading your moves" turned out to mean "On hard mode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is A Button-Reading Bastard.</a>"
</li><li> One of Nintendo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductFacelift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductFacelift">revisions</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> is cheaper than the standard version, but at the cost of not having the 3D capability that the system is named for. Nintendo compensated by advertising the "2DS" as for children, as the 3D effect of the regular 3DS could damage young eyes and the 2DS carries no risk of that. Fortunately for them this totally worked, though more so due to the lower cost making 3DS games available to people who didn't want or care about the titular aspect.
</li><li> 3DFX marketed its Voodoo line of graphics cards as not requiring users to throw out their old graphics cards. In reality, this was because the Voodoo had no 2D rendering support, and required a 2D card for that purpose, unless not being able to do any non-gaming task (such as actually <em>starting</em> those games) wasn't a problem for you. This was less of an issue than other examples, as most users already had suitable cards, and its 3D performance was world-class at the time. Most recognized the technique as a "piggyback" card, similar to MPEG-2 DVD and VideoCD accelerators at the time (the late '90s). As the technology caught up, single cards capable of doing both 2D and 3D competently - including 3dfx's own Voodoo3 line and beyond - started appearing.
</li><li> A series of ads for speech-to-text software spouts how much more convenient it is than typing by showing actors doing chores or similar while dictating a document. Then one of the ads shows a man who's writing a saucy romance novel - then closes and hides it when his family comes home. The software frees your hands - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">just make sure you're alone first</a>.
</li><li> The television ad for the NES game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">Fester's Quest</a></em> marketed it as "one tough video game", such that "if you make just one mistake, you start all over again!" While this may appeal to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeGamer">Challenge Gamer</a>, it's odd to market "you have only one life and go back to the beginning of the game if you die" as a feature.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/if-you-die-in-this-game-you-can-never-play-again-ever-1690928265">Upsillon Circuit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> takes the harshness of <em>Fester's Quest</em> one step further: You can only play once. <em>EVER.</em> When you die, <em>you are never allowed to play again!</em> And this is marketed as the ultimate hardcore challenge. An indie game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YouOnlyLiveOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YouOnlyLiveOnce">You Only Live Once</a></em> also made this a feature.
</li><li> The mobile messenger app WhatsApp does not use usernames, instead requiring the user to add another user's phone number to their contacts list in order to IM them. The app description touts the lack of usernames as a feature, stating that it means the user doesn't need to add users by username since in-app friends are automatically synchronized with the user's contacts. However, this means you can't add other users without either giving away your own phone number or asking for other users' numbers, and some users may not be comfortable giving away their phone number for a variety of privacy-related reasons, at least compared to a proprietary username. Competing apps like LINE and KakaoTalk have usernames, but also allow contact syncing.
</li><li> A lot of smartphone games use an ad that has some variant of "NOOB", showing a player doing unimpressively, and "PRO", which shows a player doing very impressively. The implication is that these are games that reward skill - in reality, most of the time, the "PRO" is doing impressively because they're higher level, and higher level in these games requires nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> (or, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">more realistically</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">spending lots of real-world currency)</a>. They did tell you there's a big difference between someone who's been playing for five minutes and someone who's been playing for five years, but they didn't say that difference was actual skill... This is especially obvious in ads for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame">Idle Games</a>, where the "PRO" literally <em>isn't even doing anything</em> (since by the higher levels in such games, the only thing the player can do most of the time is watch their cash accumulate until they can buy something).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76">Fallout 76</a></em> was heavily advertised with the statement "Every character you talk to is a real person!" This is a very polite way of saying "this game has absolutely no human NPCs in it." Sure enough, by far the most common criticism of the game was that twelve-year-olds in voicechat shouting racial slurs didn't offer much in the way of interesting character work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> advertised itself as having over 240 perks: an impressive accomplishment, when <em>3</em> had only 61 standard perks in its base game and <em>New Vegas</em> had 90. However, this advertisement left out two facts. First, the above listing included every individual rank of perks that could be upgraded; without that qualifier, it clocks in at a much less impressive 70. And second, in the prior games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> abilities like flat increases in weapon damage or healing item efficiency were governed by skills rather than perks, but in <em>4</em>, the skill system was effectively gutted and merged (more properly replaced wholesale) with the perk system—meaning that this number was now bolstered by perks that were less "neat tricks your character can do" and more "things you have to pick up to ensure your character is competent." The intended message is "just imagine what kind of amazing tricks you can pull with so many perks at your disposal!"; in practice, between the small number of genuinely unique perks and the need for them to pull double duty, you won't be doing much you couldn't do in earlier games.
</li><li> Apple's "new" Liquid Retina display. It's just their new term for the liquid crystal display (LCD) that was in every iPhone before the iPhone X, and it's inferior to the newer OLED technology also used by Apple.
</li><li> In the early 1980s, a high-end and expensive graphics card offered the "feature" of "hardware anti-aliasing", which consisted of pixels wobbling in place. Users of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> were familiar with this effect, only they called it "dot-crawl".
</li><li> The NES's Aladdin Deck Enhancer advertised itself as upgrading the game experience with more RAM and graphical power. What it didn't let on was that it was only compatible with a handful of games, and in the case of said handful, the Aladdin basically <em>was</em> their RAM and graphical power. Compatible games don't function in a standard NES without the Aladdin, due to it containing those components, and nearly all of them were also available as regular NES games no different from their Aladdin-compatible counterparts. It's less like upgrading cartridges, and more like breaking them in two and selling the parts separately. It's technically an upgrade, but in the sense that a functional but average game is an upgrade over a game that's missing its parts and doesn't fit in your NES. The actual reason was that the Aladdin was an attempt to keep costs down by taking shared components of their cartridges (including one to bypass NES copy-protection) and selling them as a separate part that consumers would only have to buy once.
</li><li> PC games sometimes advertise themselves on how hefty their filesize is, with the implication that they're insanely powerful or expansive, suitable for letting the strongest rigs show off what they can do. Most of the time, this actually owes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">their files not being coded well</a>, and the parts that deal with actual gameplay make up a small fraction of that while everything else is just random audio files that haven't been compressed properly and textures comparable to earlier games bloated out to 4K resolutions for its own sake. RAM requirements are a frequent sign of this; if the recommended amount is, as of 2020, anything higher than 8 gigabytes, then the game is probably forcing your system to pick up the slack for poor optimization on the developer's part.

What this leaves out is the mechanics of rateup; it's not that five-star characters become more common, it's that <em>if</em> the lottery decides you'll get a five-star, it is more likely to be that character. It's technically true that you're more likely to get that character on that campaign, but that's because the odds beforehand were basically zilch—the odds of getting <em>any</em> five-star is 1%. The rateup just means you have a pretty good feeling what you'll get, assuming you get one of those 1% instances. Needless to say, "RATE-UP IS A LIE" remains a fairly popular curse in the community.
</li><li> The infamous "What Can You Do With A Terabyte?" commercial by Comcast, which came in the wake of their adding a 1-TB cap to their service. The video focuses on how many cool things you can fit in one terabyte of data, ignoring that a) most of those "cool things" are things like photos or snippets of text that don't eat up much bandwidth, as opposed to actually consumptive things like games or streaming, and b) you could do all this already; Comcast is just declaring that you now have to pay them extra if you want to do anything else.

This was spun by Atari's marketing department as the two chips actually making it a 64-bit system, far outclassing others on the market. In theory, the Jaguar did indeed have some pretty impressive tech for the time, but most developers couldn't or didn't access its full potential, using alternative methods that left its games lagging behind even 16-bit titles. Other console developers would altogether abandon using their consoles' bit sizes as indicators of how "powerful" their systems were in part because of this.

However, conversion packaging is a euphemism for "not having the original packaging and instead shipping the toy in whatever they have to cut down on shipping costs." Depending on the consumer, this could either be a boon ("yay, less packaging that I need to throw out and it lowers shipping") or a deal-breaker ("boo, I can't display the toy mint in box").

It also had a slight problem in that the heat from the engine exhaust could damage the body of the car, thus requiring ceramic tiles to protect it, much like those used for the heat shielding for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere on the NASA space shuttles. Ford actually <em>bragged</em> about this "feature" by citing its need with that powerful of an engine, and the use of space-flight technology.

</div></li><li> The characteristic vibration of a Harley-Davidson engine. Harley claims that it's due to the power of the engine, and specifically calls for you to "feel the power" in their advertising. In reality, it's due to the fact that any v-twin with a v-angle less than 90° will vibrate a lot, with the effect increasing the narrower the angle. This also incorporates a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">The Coconut Effect</a>. Some Japanese-made motorcycles are faster and/or more powerful than American-made ones, but because they don't roar as loud or vibrate as much, they're seen as the "inferior" products.
</li><li> Various micro-car manufactures have made adds about how deceptively strong the frames of their cars are. SMART ran an add where an SUV was placed on top of a SMART car doing very little cosmetic damage. The SMART car was then placed on top of the SUV and did serious damage to the roof. However, few manufacturers mention that this wouldn't really be a good thing in a standard sized car, the modern theory of accident survivability being geared toward introducing weak points in the car frame to decrease deceleration. The problem with micro-cars are that there is very little, if any, room for these crumple zones. As a consequence, micro cars have to be sturdier in order to bounce off impacts rather than be crushed. Normally bouncing is <em>really</em> bad as it results in a lot of trauma to the body, but it's better than being outright crushed in this case. Still, a driver of an SUV can often walk away from a crash that sends a micro car driver to the hospital or worse.

<ul><li> When first issued to troops in Vietnam, the original M16 was described as a 'self-cleaning' weapon (this only actually applied to the gas system) which led to its notorious unreliability, until the military introduced the improved M16A1, issued cleaning kits for it, trained the soldiers how to maintain the rifle like they should have done in the first place, and made modifications to the powder used in the cartridges (to help prevent undue fouling) and the rifle itself (to resist fouling and actually facilitate cleaning and maintenance; the earliest version could only fix issues via near-complete disassembly). It didn't help that the chrome-plated bore on the prototype weapons was eliminated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">to reduce cost</a>.
</li><li> In a rare version to come out of a communist country, recruiting posters before WWII advertised how easy to use the Red Army's new toy, the SVT-38, was. They especially mentioned how easy it was to disassemble, ignoring that this claim was because the gun could actually come apart on its own. Worse, "easy to disassemble" does not necessarily mean "easy to put back together". After the Cold War, some gun shops advertised that the SVT-38's successor, the SVT-40, used a nifty pinless disassembly system. They of course neglected to mention how much easier the gun would be to take apart if it was held together by pins rather than spring pressure. Red Army grunts who were lucky enough to be issued one<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7agjm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7agjm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7agjm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for all of its faults, the average soldier would still probably want to learn how to use an SVT-40 properly than use a bolt action, or worse, nothing.</span> joked that if you needed to take the thing apart, you needed to find a willing comrade to help you.
</li><li> Be wary of any cheap sword or fantasy weapon made with "historically accurate practices." Usually it will only be some historical practices, like the use of lower quality metal (and minus the tempering to fix that) or the lack of modern techniques like quality control.
<ul><li> A sub-example of this is "folded steel." Yes, it was used to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">katanas</a>... but that's because it's a technique to remove impurities from and increase the durability of low-quality metal. Simply using good-quality metal would have the same effect, so the maker is either using bad steel, using unnecessary forging methods, or flat-out lying, none of which bode well.
</li></ul></li><li> Claims to be made of "stainless steel", when dealing with medieval weapons. It sure <em>sounds</em> high-quality, but stainless steel isn't just "regular steel but better", nor is it more expensive than regular steel. It has a number of downsides that make it really unfavorable for the purpose of being a weapon, including being far less flexible and resistant to wear compared to, say, carbon steel. It does have advantages, mainly the fact that you don't need to really worry about rust, advantages that come into play if you just want something to hang on your wall and look nice, and there are cases like armor or short blades where stainless steel does have its place. But in the case of swords, the big-ticket item, try to use it like an actual weapon or even just swing it around experimentally, and there's a not unlikely chance it'll fall apart. But then, "MADE OF HIGH-GRADE CHROMIUM STAINLESS STEEL" sounds a lot more appealing than "FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY".
</li><li> In the rifle market, many manufacturers sell guns advertised to be as close to military-grade as possible while still being legal. Few mention that this isn't really a good thing unless you happen to be a collector. Military rifles have loads of features basically useless for civilians (bayonet lugs for example) and often lack features civilians would find handy (cheek rests, adjustable stocks, higher and more consistent accuracy). This is because they are either making the guns from the same machines they use for military orders or building them from surplus parts, slapping in a semi-auto-only trigger group, then jacking up the price on the assumption that the buyer won't know better. Back in the day when stocks of military surplus rifles were high, it was common for them sell about half the price of civilian rifles of similar capabilities. Now it's common to find military style rifles that sell for twice as much as a "sporterized" version of the same platform. Keep in mind as well that these are weapons designed for use by the military - the military that wants to save as much money as possible when they're buying weapons to arm hundreds of thousands of soldiers. There's an important distinction between military-spec and military-grade in regards to this - military spec means you can generally build your own Frankenguns out of parts from several manufacturers without worrying whether they will fit together, since they're designed to fit identically so replacement parts are easy to get and painless to use; military <em>grade</em> means "made by the lowest bidder", so civilian weapons will be a better investment.
</li><li> Several weapons based on designs from the "Combloc"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note804qn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note804qn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note804qn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is generally how the Eastern Bloc plus China and Yugoslavia (the communist countries where one can actually find guns and gun parts from) are referred to in firearms circles</span> are advertised as made from genuine parts kits. This is even worse than the above "military spec" guns, as it's a fancy way to say "used." It means not only are the guns assembled from random parts from actual militaries, it also generally means that these parts are from the guns these countries <em>don't want</em> anymore, usually because they are worn out from being in constant use since the '50s and '60s. If a manufacture does take the time to make sure it's using quality second-hand parts, they will usually advertise the weapon as being made from refurbished parts, and their efforts will generally be visible even to an untrained eye.

</li><li> Those commercials for Goldline that you see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GlennBeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GlennBeck">Glenn Beck</a> advertising insist that, since the entire world will soon be descending into poverty-driven madness, you should trade in all of your soon-to-be-worthless cash for their delicious, shiny gold. They don't bother mentioning that since they're taking in all the paper money, they're driving <em>themselves</em> into the future, gold-driven poorhouse. That's because actually, they're making money by pretending to be gold brokers who are trading cash for gold near the current rate, when they're really selling gold at a <em>huge</em> markup. There's been some Senate inquiries into this. While the price of gold probably is going to go down and isn't that great an investment, if you wish to buy gold anyway, check the current price of gold online so when you go to buy it, you aren't suckered by someone offering it to you at three times what the market says it's worth. <br/><br/>One has to wonder if they have a partnership with the exact opposite companies like "Cash 4 Gold" who are urging you to send in your unwanted gold, silver, platinum, or whatever jewelry and get cash in return... with, of course, the company you're sending your jewelry to deciding on exactly <em>how much</em> cash you get in return. It's actually quite hilarious on the occasions when commercials for these two types of companies air sequentially. <em>South Park</em> played that exact scenario in one episode. It also relies on people buying into the misconception that gold has an inherent value, so that in a potential post-apocalyptic scenario they will have reliably precious gold on hand instead of "worthless paper". In actuality, should civilization go belly-up, gold could be just as worthless<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note97k3y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note97k3y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note97k3y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Currency are only valuable insofar as society accepts their value. In the event of some kind of economic crash that results in currency becoming worthless, then the default method of trade would switch to the barter method: "I'll give you this in return for that." Currency evolved as an intermediary for determining value (instead of "I'll give you one cow for two loaves of bread", it became "I'll give this other guy one cow for $5, then use that $5 to buy two loaves of bread"), but has no intrinsic value beyond that. Similarly, gold is valuable only as long as <em>we say</em> it has value: it can't be used for anything in and of itself by most people. On the other hand, it is beautiful, rare and does not rust. But also notes and base metal coins are quite pretty and as they will be rarer and rarer, they may become valuable.

They neglect to mention that while some local industries might grow, it's probable that more will wither away because their international market becomes reduced and they can't obtain raw materials as cheaply. Taking an economic hit that puts hundreds of thousands of people out of work in exchange for a few thousand new jobs is a net loss. Note that if sanctions were good for any country, they would be the ones the imposing the sanctions, not having them imposed upon. (Of course, countries sometimes do this regardless, like Russia itself with "counter-sanctions".)

Industrial diamonds are far cheaper than diamonds for jewelry, so to try to push them into the more lucrative jewelry market, there's been a push to marketing them as "chocolate diamonds." This had been done once before, in the '70s, when they were marketed as "cognac diamonds" and pushed as the more masculine alternative to white diamonds and better suited for men's jewelry. Now the target audience is women, and anything called chocolate supposedly feels more feminine. The irony is, brown diamonds can be <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_diamonds#/media/File:National_Museum_of_Natural_History_Gold_Colored_Diamonds.JPG">quite lovely<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> even without the marketing spin.

This is because their wands are mass-produced crap that is liable to stop working within months. Compare Ollivander's wands which are expected to (and usually do) last a lifetime.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation">Alien: Isolation</a></em>, Seegson constantly touts the advantages of its android line, "the working Joe." Compared to the Weyland-Yutani androids we see in other material, the working Joe has a really creepy crash-test-dummy appearance as opposed to looking completely human, is hooked up to a central mainframe (which can be hacked or corrupted) rather than being self-contained, and seems to have no sense of morality or doubts about following even the most murderous orders as opposed to requiring modification to even consider taking a life. The advertisements instead claim that this inhuman appearance is obviously better because it (supposedly) avoids the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> or fears of androids disguised as humans, and their total lack of morality, independence, or decisionmaking is better because it means it'll always do what you tell it. (Needless to say, it has nothing to do with both of these things being far cheaper than the alternative.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FrankAndErnest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FrankAndErnest">Frank and Ernest</a></em> occasionally has fun with this in Sunday strips, with Frank looking over an advertisement Ernie has written, pointing out issues or missed points regarding his advertised item along the way, and Ernie promptly explaining how his advertisement has spun these issues into alleged positives. For instance, a run-down theater whose roof is missing is referred to as "the place to see the stars" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">because you can see stars through the open roof at night</a>).
</li><li> In one random event in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a>,</em> the Seawater Refinery <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">works way too well</a>. The player can choose to send the excess to farms for boosted food production, or to the town reservoir for free upkeep. Either way, this becomes "A feature, not a bug."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest">Deltora Quest</a></em>, a huckster advertises a kind of "wheel of fortune" game called Beat the Bird. The wheel has a 50-50 shot of giving the player no money back, with an effectively worthless wooden figurine of a bird as consolation, and a few options that do give the player money only let them break even (and on top of that, the game is fixed). To cover this up, he proudly declares that "every player wins a prize!", even though a comparatively small percentage will get a prize that isn't a ripoff.
