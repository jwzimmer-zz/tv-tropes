</p><p>This is the sort of character that goes by doctrines along the lines of "Don't cling to pain. Don't expect happiness. Don't fear loss. Accept reality as it is. Enjoy the good. Endure the bad.

</p><p>The Anti-Nihilist is very likely to adhere to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utilitarianism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utilitarianism">Utilitarian</a> morality to work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness">For Happiness</a>, although this isn't a universal rule; there are Anti-Nihilists whose morality might border on self-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>.

After all, if the future is set in stone, they're already going to do what they plan on doing, <em>so it doesn't matter anyway</em>. Might as well have fun with it and do some good. This very attitude may even make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFate">Immune to Fate</a> by simple virtue of not giving a flip about what the normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecies</a> say.

See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Übermensch</a> for the type of person who believes in creating their own meaning and morality, but may not be quite as caring or considerate of others in the process. May choose to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero">Small Steps Hero</a>; though they don't believe there's any real "Bigger Picture" to fight for, that means the little pictures are more important.
</p><p>May overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a>, who is character that, besides his cynical views, decided to be a good guy not because of the beliefs that it can change the world for better, but just because is the right thing to do.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm">I Am What I Am</a> is the process of embracing the Anti-Nihilist worldview.

During one very close battle against an Angel that appears to be the final moments before the end of the world, he is watering the melon patch he is growing, with the battle being visible in the distance. If the world does not end on that day, then the melons need to be watered. If it does, then it won't matter what he is doing in the final moments anyway. Either way, he can't do anything to change what's going to happen in the next ten minutes.

The victim of a seemingly random and meaningless tragedy, young Bruce Wayne could have decided that life itself was meaningless and succumbed to depression and nihilism. But instead he chose to focus on what his parents meant to him and to Gotham, re-inventing himself as a force for order and justice, which stands in direct opposition to The Joker's strain of chaos and destruction. There's actually a surprisingly deep (if unsubtle) quote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> which captures the existential nature of Batman's character.

The Joker firmly believes that "one bad day" is all it takes to shatter a person's perceptions of morality and order, driving them just as crazy as he is. To prove it, he shoots and paralyzes Barbra Gordon (while Commissioner Gordon watches), then kidnaps the elder Gordon and drags him to a dilapidated amusement park, where he's stripped naked, beaten, and forced to view gigantic photos of his daughter's nude, crippled body. When Batman arrives, the Joker delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">long speech</a> about how, by driving Gordon insane, he's proved that all of humanity's struggles are ultimately pointless—life is simply a "monstrous, demented gag." But as it turns out, Gordon is <em>fine</em>—he not only managed to resist going crazy, he even insists that Batman capture the Joker "by the book" to make a statement about law and order still working. Batman, for his part, remarks that he's heard the Joker's "gag" interpretation before (presumably when his parents were killed), and still doesn't find it funny. In short, both Batman and Gordon acknowledge that life <em>is</em> sick and twisted, which means that imposing structure on it through principles like justice and kindness is all we <em>can</em> do.

They may also seek to "escape" their reality, either through overactive imaginations (some of Alvy's childhood memories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall">Annie Hall</a></em>, for instance) or more mysterious, generally unexplained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDevice">Plot Devices</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis">Midnight in Paris</a></em>).

Two elderly women are at a Catskill Mountain resort, and one of 'em says, "Boy, the food at this place is really terrible." The other one says, "Yeah, I know; and such small portions." Well, that's essentially how I feel about life—full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly." <br/><br/>This, however, is turned around when Alvy shares another joke at the very end of the film<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ubsd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ubsd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ubsd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy; he thinks he's a chicken."

Do that if you wish, Whie. Do that if you wish. To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night, Padawan: but choose!

As such, Meursault considers everything as pointless and doesn't care about his image, his relationships or love, and always speaks his mind truly.

Once imprisoned and deprived of all his immediate pleasures (swimming in the sea, liying on the sand, women, smoking cigarettes, etc) and his freedom, Meursault quickly learn to adapt and be happy with this life as well, occupiying his time between sleeping and minutely re-examining his memories.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> has a variation as its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a>. The mythology teaches that the gods are in constant battle to keep the universe intact. They all know it's doomed, yet continues to fight and are going to continue through Ragnarök until they have died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">It's better to try to win even if futile, than simply surrendering.</a> Moreover, some prophecies of Ragnarök (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>) claim that although civilization will collapse and the vast majority of humans and gods will die, the very fact that they fought to exist will allow <em>some</em> kind of new cosmos to be rebuilt from the wreckage. For this reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> considered Norse religion the noblest form of paganism, and wrote that if God told us he was dying, it was better to die nobly with him than to join the forces killing him and "win." Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em> states: "Cattle die and kinsmen die, thyself too soon must die, but one thing never, I ween, will die,—fair fame of one who has earned." Though the Norse believed in several afterlives, they did not consider the deeds done in life as the key to a certain afterlife like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Valhalla</a>, but the manner of death. Instead they spoke for giving oneself a good reputation because that was the only thing that would be left of them in this world.
</li><li> Traditionally considered the writer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">the biblical book</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfEcclesiastes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfEcclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>, King Solomon is perceived as this by some, even to the point that some argue it inspired Buddhism to a degree. The book doesn't downplay the existence of God, but doesn't shy away from detailing the futility of human life or the acts of humanity as a whole, noting that the good can suffer and the wicked can prosper. However, it also recalls the joy to be found in various aspects of life and in doing good. Ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a>; in the end, Solomon finally declares that man does, in fact, have a duty: to fear God and keep his commandments, because in the end, he will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">bring all good and evil deeds into account</a>.
<div class="indent">This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. Anyone who is among the living has hopeeven a live dog is better off than a dead lion! <br/>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten. Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun. <br/>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sunall your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
</div></li><li> Usually, this is the classical response of agnostics, atheists, deists, Epicureans and the like to accusations of nihilism and hedonism; since some theists think that if there is no god or gods (or the god in question is apathetic) who will give us a meaning in such a miserable life, everyone would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>.

<ul><li> Merle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheAdventureZoneBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheAdventureZoneBalance">The Adventure Zone: Balance</a></em> summarizes his general life philosophy as being one of finding happiness and making others happy because "no one's getting out of this life alive anyways."
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The Bleak Cabal is canonically an example of this. Life is meaningless and cruel so hey, no need to add more meaningless cruelty to it by your own actions. The Bleak Cabal runs Sigil's soup kitchens and asylum, and are at a whole a rather decent bunch even if most of them are insane to one degree or another. Sure, their actions won't make any difference in the long run (but in their view, <em>nothing</em> does anyway), but it helps <em>today</em>. They may be the only example on the page that exist <em>in the afterlife,</em> surrounded by evidence of gods, and still hold to this philosophy. Of course, beholding a being of divine power and acknowledging it as an <em>empirically</em> superior being are two different things.
</li><li> A 2nd Edition <em>Planewalker's Handbook</em> described three "archetypes" for Bleakers, of which the middle one fits this trope well (and the first not at all):
<div class="indent"> Perpetually depressed: "Nothing means anything, so why bother doing anything?" <br/>Perpetually cheerful: "Nothing means anything, so why not do anything?" <br/>Perpetually mad: "Nothing means anything, so anything means anything!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> The more idealistic characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. Sure enough, the world is gangbanged from all directions by undead, Wyld mutants, demons, and other awful things. The folks in charge of defending it are too busy politicking. Heaven is a sham and a scam, and the patron god of heroism is a crack addict. But—and this is a massive <em>but</em>—you're a hero, possessed of a power to drastically change the world. And by "hero", it's hero in an archaic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Übermensch</a> sense: you get to decide what is right or wrong, answerable only to your own conscience (or the lack thereof).
</li><li> Nurgle, the Chaos God of disease and despair in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> is, surprisingly enough, like this. Yes, all things will eventually die and rot, and you will most likely never achieve your dreams, but does that matter? Instead of angsting over it or spending you life trying to reach an impossible goal, you should just be happy with what you have. Nurgle loves you no matter what you do. Of course he is the god of disease, so while he genuinely does care for you, his idea of caring involves "gifting" people with terrible diseases...
<ul><li> Well of course. Diseases are made out of millions of lifeforms. Someone needs to love those too.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the Bleak Cabal above, this is also canonically the attitude of the faithful of the Sovereign Host in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>. People of Khorvaire know for a fact that the afterlife is a dreary, gray wasteland known as Dolurrh where the best they can hope for is for their soul to slowly fade away into nothingness. The gods are unresponsive, and even angels and fiends can't say whether they even <em>exist</em>. Despite that, the Sovereign Host teaches that life is for living and people should find meaning in creating the world they'll leave behind. Nearly every other religion's teachings have a hard time with this truth and include some idea about how <em>their</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">faith will</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">let them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">escape Dolurrh.</a>

<ul><li> Arguably, the Abzan clan, from the Plane of Tarkir. Yes, life is tough and food is scarce... but that just means it's all the more important to look after each other and what little nature exists in the desert that they live in. They prioritize family, and every family has a tree that they protect with their lives. This stems from their colors: primarily white (emphasizing community) with some green (emphasizing nature) and black (emphasizing pragmatism).
</li><li> The more sympathetic interpretations of the Black color in general fall under this. All the other colors focus on ways to shape the world to one end or other, but Black encourages its followers to live the best lives they can in a harsh, cruel, unreasonable world that cannot be meaningfully improved or changed.
</li><li> The Aetherborn, introduced in Kaladesh, take Black's stand on this (above) to its extreme. They are born with the knowledge that their lives are very short, and so are determined to live life to the fullest. This even extends to their deaths, as rather than holding a funeral, an Aetherborn near death will hold a party, with mandatory attendance of friends and associates.

The game setting is described as apocalyptic, with the world falling apart, and there being no signs of positive outcomes, no matter how much you preserve and struggle, but despite the bleak circumstances, the character carries on anyway, because in doing so, they carve meaning out of meaninglessness.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> himself expresses such a view at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Black Knight</a></em>. As he puts it, every world will eventually end; the only thing you can do is live your life to the fullest in the time you have. This exact outlook of his, unknowingly to some, was established all the way back in the very first game in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline">Tagline</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">on the Japanese box art</a>:

At the end of the game, Kefka declares that everything lives only to die, and that most people will live lives devoid of any genuine meaning or impact on the world, then die and be forgotten one day. To him, all life is meaningless and insignificant. The party, particularly Terra, tell him it doesn't matter; the day-to-day struggles and triumphs, the love of friends and family, and the hope to improve one's lot in life, give life a meaning all their own and make it worth living.

The main difference between his and Shirou's outlooks is that Shiki sees everything as meaningless because of his Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, which force him to see the world and everything in it as being as fragile as cardboard, and as such can derive meaning for himself simply from living a good life in what little time he has (and he has even less than a normal person, also as a result of his powers).

Incidentally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> would later go on to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a>.

<ul><li> Søren Kierkegaard's "Knight of Faith", one of the major influences to the Existentialist trope. You fully accept that following such stuff about God and ethics is ultimately an absurd goal in this life, but in contrast to the aesthetic "nihilist" and the otherworldly "knight of infinite resignation", you still prefer to make the most of it.

It should also be noted that he pointed out that a way to make life suck a little less could be through charitable acts (note that he didn't say that it would make you happy, just feel less angsty/guilty/whatever).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertCamus">Albert Camus</a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStranger">The Stranger</a></em>. In his essay <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus">The Myth of Sisyphus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> he argues that the absurdity (desire for man to find meaning and the Universe's indifference to this desire) of life is in fact an invitation for human beings to experience revolt, freedom and passion and not in fact a valid reason to commit suicide (which he argues is even <em>more</em> absurd than life itself), concluding with the thought that "The struggle itself [...] is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

He was determined to stamp his life with his only meaning. By playing the first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">maxing out his character's levels</a> to level 99.

<div class="indent">Life does not have inherent meaning; to say that our lives are pointless and our achievements meaningless is to state the obvious. No matter how grand our achievements or how broad their scope, time turns all to dust and death destroys all memory. But that does not mean we cannot ascribe our own meaning to what we do. It is because nothing has meaning unto itself that we are free to create meaning, to make metaphor, and in doing so reflect on ourselves and our world.
</div></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thelastbrokenhome.com/life-is-meaningless/">This guy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who during a philosophy class in college, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllDieSomeday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllDieSomeday">realized he was going to die like billions before (and after) him</a>, and that nothing could prevent it. While he briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">ranted about the shortness of life, concluded that every choices taken in human existence were totally devoid of meaning, and that nothing will remain of us when we are gone</a>, he quickly adopted a much more positive set of mind: if death is inevitable, then 1) It renders all our fears obsolete and 2) It should make us even more happy to be alive. Camus sure would have approved this guy's way of thinking.
<div class="indent">That life is limited and finite that it holds no real reason or meaning, does not mean it is not worth living, that its not worth trying, that its not worth enjoying. For we are here already, and will continue to be until whatever time God or nature determines we ought not to be. Till then  till our deaths  we are here. Were here anyway. Were here because  in some weird way  were meant to be here. And so, by whatever luck, we have days left to live. And in that class on that day, the seeds of a very important lesson were sowedthat to live the rest of my days, as I had lived the many days before that day  as a sad and sorry kid, weak of mind and body, and scared of most everything  seemed, wellstupid. Cause whatever the meaning of life, of this much I was certain That on that day, and on this day, I stand above that ground rather than lay below it. And thats not a thing to waste. And everything that scared me, and everything that worried me  some test, some cute girl, some misfortune or future I had no control over  all of it meant nothing. So, fuck that. It was time to be free.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt">Patton Oswalt</a> described his late wife Michelle McNamara (a true crime writer who specialized in cold cases) as <em>loathing</em> the platitude of "everything happens for a reason", and countering with her own philosophy of "It's chaos. Be kind." He urges his audiences to do the same.

After all, it does stand to reason that if nothing in life has any intrinsic value, that does technically include all forms of hierarchy and government too.
</li><li> Luther Burbank hated religion and stated he didn't believe there was any afterlife.
