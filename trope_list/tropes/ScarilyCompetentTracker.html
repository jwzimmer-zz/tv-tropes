<ul><li> Subverted in a car commercial where a hiker, hearing a car coming, demonstrates his scary-competency in tracking to his friends by putting his ear to the ground and identifying the approaching vehicle as a high-end sports car. The car that eventually passes by isn't a sports car, of course, but the point of the commercial was supposed to be that you shouldn't be able to tell the difference.
</li><li> A British car commercial had a tribesman observing vibrations and identifying the animals causing them from a great distance. He then spots a car passing in the distance and seems to think it must be a ghost because it's so quiet that nothing is vibrating.
</li><li> Another series of car commercials had random people placing their ears on the ground and managing to identify the brand, model, various specifications, <em>and even the color</em> of the car.

Only one problem: the Nobuseri are giant mecha. That fly.
<ul><li> The vibrations from the sounds of their propulsion systems would still vibrate the ground, allowing him to hear something.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> has a preternatural sense of smell, keener even than Shippo's, though not as keen as his older brother Sesshomaru's. It's still keen enough to track someone by scent <em>while running</em>, detect the clash of magical auras, and detect Kagome's arrival through a trans-temporal portal from at least half a mile away, especially jarring, since it is simply not possible to smell something unless the air that carries the scent comes all the way from there to you. He also has heightened sense of hearing, once shown comically when he overhears what Shippo is whispering about him from a distance of a couple hundred feet.

</li><li> Shampoo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> managed to track Ranma for over a thousand miles, across at least two countries, and the Sea Of Japan.

Her sense of smell is even better than Logan's, and she's demonstrably been able to locate individuals in a crowded city <em>hours</em> after they were last there. In one case it even allowed her to completely reconstruct a crime scene  including the movements of <em>dozens</em> of individuals  <em>by scent alone</em>. Combine that with her extensive espionage and intelligence training.

Unfortunately, Rantanplan is there as well, and seeing that it isn't food, goes the other way. The Mexicans believe they'd split up and follows Rantanplan. Luke knows better, though.

It went to the point that Elias Van Dahl used <em>time travel</em> to escape him, going from Meridian at the end of the twentieth century to Earth in the seventeenth century... And then one day <em>Cedric barged in with his men</em>. It's implied he had actually been there for a while and had just waited for the eve of his wedding out of sheer sadism.

<ul><li> Aragorn does this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em> (book and film), first tracking the Uruk-hai, then later explaining how Merry and Pippin escaped them during a battle. That latter example is interesting because it takes him no effort to find the traces of both hobbits over a battlefield. To be fair, Aragorn discovers the footprints by accident while mourning them. Everything else he does after he chances upon them falls under this trope though.
<ul><li> Far more realistic in the book, where Aragorn is only able to notice signs because the hobbits had dropped their cloak-clasp as a sign on the way before they escaped and had been carried away from where the main battle was. Even then, Aragorn is only able to deduce fairly basic information from the signs and outright admits that a lot of what he sees doesn't make sense unless he acknowledges that a few pertinent facts will have taken place elsewhere, or will otherwise have left no visible signs. Nevertheless, he does have impressive tracking skills, which is justified by having been raised and lived as a Ranger of the wilds of Eriador. He does mention having limits, being unwilling to continue the chase across the plains of Rohan at night, as the trail is harder to see compared to when they were in the forest and the risk of losing it in the dark is too great. Also, the only reason he finds Pippin's lorien leaf clasp in the book is because Pippin ran from the Orcs to drop it away from them, so the clasp wouldn't be trampled and hidden. In the movie, Aragorn finds the clasp after it's been trampled and buried in the ground. At another point, he's completely baffled by what he sees, because he's never encountered Ent-tracks before.
</li><li> The original novel also mentions how he tracked down and captured Gollum, one of his most impressive feats. It had been decades since the only solid clue of Gollum's location had gone cold!
</li><li> For that matter, Gollum himself; following tracks and rumours allowed him to trace a lot of Bilbo's journey despite not starting to look until a year after it happened. He was able to pick up the trail of the Fellowship while they were all stuck in Moria, and maintained a pursuit of them all the way out of it despite their taking refuge for a while in Lorien, and then going by river. Even Aragorn admitted that he couldn't figure out a way to shake Gollum's pursuit once he was firmly on their trail. He even managed to track down Sam and Frodo again in the middle of Mordor. Part of this is implied to be a preternatural sense for the Ring, although Gandalf also once stated that long exposure to the Ring sharpened his senses in a way that made him good at things such as sneaking and following and finding secrets.

He does it again on the location of the fight between the Man in Black and Fezzik. And then again at the Battle of Wits site, where he is able to identify the colorless, odorless poison as iocaine powder by <em>smell</em>, though this one was intended as a bit of a joke for observant audience members (though finding a man who'd been killed by ingesting poison and figuring out that it must be a colorless and oderless toxin based on the goblet lacking any discoloration or scent does make sense).

</li></ul><div class="indent"> "A favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread in the tracks of the moccasined enemy, and thus hide his own trail. Cooper wore out barrels and barrels of moccasins in working that trick. Another stage-property that he pulled out of his box pretty frequently was his broken twig. He prized his broken twig above all the rest of his effects, and worked it the hardest. It is a restful chapter in any book of his when somebody doesnt step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds and whites for two hundred yards around. Every time a Cooper person is in peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is sure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to step on, but that wouldnt satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn out and find a dry twig; and if he cant do it, go and borrow one."

When asked what's going on by his more mission-focused partner, he deems the object he's chewing cinnamon, and when yelled at, notes that the heroes have been through the area, because all of the broken branches and twigs.

The FBI remain unconvinced, so he proceeds to tell one of them about his own weight, eating habits, and ankle holster from footprints. When the FBI agent sarcastically asks how much change was in the man's pockets, the sheriff gives that information too. Given that Crow Horse is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>, one assumes that he's joking.

<ul><li> This trope is parodied in the following joke:
<div class="indent"> A small group of hikers are walking along a narrow mountain road in the Rocky Mountains. Along the way they come across a man lying on the side of the road with one ear pressed to the ground. "What is it?" one of the hikers asks him. The stranger replies, "A horse-drawn wagon, traveling east. One of the horses is chestnut, the other black with a white spot on its forehead. The driver is a young man in a blue flannel shirt, and he has a passenger, a blond woman in a yellow cotton dress." "Wow, you can tell all of that just by listening to the vibrations in the ground?" the hiker asks. The stranger answers: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No, they just ran me over half an hour ago.</span>"
</div></li><li> In a variation on the joke, an Indian presses his ear to the ground and says "Buffalo come." The non-Indian members of the party, impressed, ask him if he can hear the vibrations. "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No. Ground sticky</span>."
</li><li> In another joke, a group of hunters come across tracks in the woods. They argue about the details of the animal that left them until one mans leans down and claims he's determined the animal's age and zodiac sign.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> did this <em>a lot</em>.
<ul><li> In the very first story, "A Study in Scarlet", he provides this description of the murderer:
<div class="indent"><strong>Holmes:</strong> There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long.
</div></li><li> His explanation to Watson follows shortly:
<div class="indent"><strong>Holmes:</strong> The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morningI have Gregson's word for thatit follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house... Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride... I had this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child's play. <br/><strong>Watson:</strong> And his age? <br/><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. <br/><strong>Watson:</strong> The fingernails and the Trichinopoly. <br/><strong>Holmes:</strong> The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey — such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes.
</div></li><li> At the story "The sign of the four", Sherlock notices that a suspect has stepped on tar, so he uses a hound called Toby to follow him. He brags to Watson that he could have used "thousands" of ways to do it, but this is the most fast.
</li><li> At the story "The devil's foot", Sherlock claims to have shadowed some suspect. When the suspect says he didn't see anyone, Sherlock answers that nothing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert">is all he will see when Sherlock tracks him</a>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Vimes:</strong> The trick is to know the correct answer beforehand.

</li><li> Hurin in general has a paranormal sense for violence that he describes as having a scent. Even the Aes Sedai don't know how he does it. It's known to not be Channelling, so he's assumed to just be a Talent.

He finds the crashed tour car after the T-Rex kicked it, the last known place where Tim and Lex were known to be. After finding Tims watch left behind, he notices that while the face is cracked, the band is uninjured, deducing that given the toughness of watch face crystals, it could have only broken during the attack, but the uninjured band means that the T-rex didnt tear it off the kid. So Tim must have taken off the broken watch after the attack, meaning he survived.
<ul><li> The paragraph before, though, Muldoon subverts this. He remarks that its usually very difficult to track anything after an animal attack, and while most people assume the aftermath of such encounters are filled with blood and gore, the truth is that theres usually nothing, since a predator can easily kill a child just by shaking them to snap their neck, making it look to the detectives as though the child just walked out.

Vampires have some sort of weird instinct that lets them always accurately guess which direction someone has gone or if somebody is near by. Werewolves have heightened senses of hearing and smell, and since they also possess human minds, they're basically tracking dogs that can make well thought out decisions and predict where a target they lost the scent of has gone based on human behavior.

Usually the Master has to run all the way until they bump into the person they're trailing; the more focused they become on the trail, the more oblivious they are to anything else - which means they're vulnerable to attacks and should never work alone. A common side effect from a gifted Master of Pursuit being on your trail includes mood shifts: Lady Melamori Blimm gives her victims terrible weakness and depression, while another (posthumous) character was able to fine-tune his target's sensations in line with the seriousness of their crime.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Druids in cat form</a> can track humanoids. Warlocks can track demons.

</li><li> Through a certain combination of class, profession choice, and quests, it is possible to be able to track <em>everything</em> in the game. This is only possible if you roll a Hunter (Track Beasts, Humanoids, Dragonkin, etc, etc) who is an Herbalist (Track Herbs) and a Miner (Track Minerals), and who has also managed to fish up a "Weatherbeaten Journal" which, upon reading, allows you to Track Fish.

You know how, in some games with Time Trials, you have the option to follow a "ghost"? Exactly like that. Oh, and if you're a guard who is on patrol with a set path, he can also see the paths you are <em>going</em> to be walking, and where you tend to stop. And where your path intersects with other guards. <br/>His Eagle Vision can also pick out concealed doorways and passages, along with being able to find the <em>one person</em> in a crowd who has what he needs. Fifty guards wandering around, and only one of them has a key, which is hidden in a pouch where no one could possibly spot it? Disguised as a hooded priest in a monastery full of men dressed <em>exactly the same way</em>, from whom you are indistinguishable to the point that your own mother couldn't pick you out of a line-up? If Ezio turns on his Eagle Vision, you will be lit up like the Holy Grail. Good luck escaping this man.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Connor Kenway</a> fits into this category as well, though in the traditional sense of tracking rather than Eagle Vision.
</li><li> Connor's grandfather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Edward</a> has this as well, although lacking Connor's Native American upbringing. One would wonder why a privateer/pirate would need such skills, but they appear to be exclusively based on Eagle Vision rather than training. Once he's caught a glimpse of you, he'll even see you through a building.
</li><li> Interesting enough, this is averted with Altair, who is acknowledged as the greatest in-universe several times. He had the simplest version of Eagle Vision (you couldn't even walk with it like you could with Ezio and the others) but was apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">the most competent of them all</a>.

Charles Smith, a fellow member of the Van Der Linde gang of mixed black and Native American descent, gives him a quick rundown of how to track and hunt animals in the prologue (teaching the player how to use the ability), and is implied to be much more skilled at both. Interestingly, if the player activates the ability while in the gang's camp, the trails of individual gang members become visible and identifiable by name, implying that Arthur (like real life examples listed below) can recognize his fellow gang members by footprints alone.

Ustanak at least has support and Intel from Neo Umbrella to help him out, but The Nemesis' ability to find Jill wherever she goes in Raccoon City is near supernatural.

According to some accounts, they're even able to identify people by name only by looking at their footprints.
<ul><li> The Lipan Apache of North America could also do this, plus more, such as identifying various psychological states, body positioning, specific injuries, and fullness of stomach and bladder.

</li><li> From <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borshay_Lee">Richard B. Lee's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> book on the Dobe Ju/'hoansi:
<div class="indent">...both men and women are able to identify an individual person merely by the sight of his or her footprint in the sand. There is nothing mysterious about this. Their tracking is a skill, cultivated over a lifetime, that builds on literally tens of thousands of observations (see also Liebenberg, 1990).The Ju hunter can deduce many kinds of information about the animal he is tracking: its species and sex, its age, how fast it is travelling, whether it is alone or with other animals, its physical condition (healthy or ill), whether and on what it is feeding, and the time of day the animal passed this way.
</div></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Wolves">Shadow Wolves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a law enforcement group composed largely of Native Americans that falls under the Department of Homeland Security, largely rely on traditional methods to track illegal aliens and drug smugglers who try to cross the U.S. - Mexican border. Their track record is quite impressive indeed, as they're often able to track and catch their quarry using only the slightest of clues as to their presence.
</li></ul></li><li> Terry Grant from the Canadian reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mantracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mantracker">Mantracker</a></em>. Each episode consists of him using his expert tracking skills to hunt down the "prey" (contestants), such as immediately identifying a stump that was freshly cut by observing that the dirt used to attempt to camouflage it included a small pebble that couldn't have gotten there naturally.
<ul><li> An extreme example: About every other group will try to "trick" Mantracker by doing something sneaky, like walking backwards through mud, or attempt to double back on their footprints. And almost without fail, Mantracker will take one look at their work and <em>instantly</em> spot the deception.
<ul><li> Even accounting for the time he spends explaining to the camera how he spotted the trick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">it still takes more time for the prey to set up the trick than for the tracker to see right through it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The show also provides a demonstration of the part of tracking that isn't usually mentioned: not merely looking at the tracks, but anticipating <em>what</em> your target is likely to do, so you know where they are likely to go or have been and can pick up the trail after you've lost it.
</li><li> He also explains using other environment clues such as the behavior of the local wildlife in reaction to people walking through. In one episode he notices a pack of wild horses NOT walking his way to investigate him and his horse, thus deduces that something <em>else</em> must be holding their attention. He quickly finds his prey surrounded by the horses.

He could tell how old tracks were, as well as the sex, size, and condition of the animal that made them. He could even identify individual tigers he had observed before.
</li><li> As shown in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzkB4QNGrMI">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Behind the scenes segment for Lone Target/Manhunt, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FilipinosWithFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FilipinosWithFirearms">Philippine Army Scout Rangers</a> are an <em>entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a></em> of trackers that can operate with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">nothing more than their wits, determination and a couple of jeeps</a></em>.
</li><li> More generally, human beings. Our large brains are very good at taking in details, and in turn tracking. Couple this with our impressive endurance, and we can literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">chase things to death.</a>
</li><li> While we can talk a lot about specific humans, the real scarily competent trackers are Bloodhounds. All they need is a little of your scent and then it becomes basically impossible to get away from them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a> even busted a myth that's it's possible to baffle one even through ridiculous circumstances.
<ul><li> Pureblood (and trained) Bloodhounds are one of the few non-humans that can be used as witnesses (instead of as evidence) in a United States trial and, along with their trainer, are considered expert witnesses.
</li><li> Dogs in general. The reason why humans and dogs get along so great is both are persistence hunters, who require this trope to work properly, and both could track in ways the others could not (Humans do have a good sense of smell, but nowhere close to a dog's, which in turn do not have the visual senses a human has, notably lacking tricolor vision).
