</li><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES">Older Than the NES</a> example, many old text adventures (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction">Interactive Fiction</a>) games allow you to easily recover from death (sometimes by simply "walking out" of the afterlife, sometimes with an "undo" command) but have some exceptions where that doesn't work if you <em>really</em> screw up, such as by wiping yourself from existence through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a>. Examples include:
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a></em> trilogy always cut to a prompt allowing you to "RESTART, RESTORE, or QUIT" upon death. The notable exception was if you died in <em>Zork 3</em> while using the time machine to travel to the past  the game simply and immediately quit to the system command prompt, due to the historical paradox making your character cease to have ever existed entirely. This becomes particularly jarring for people playing the games on emulators on modern systems.
</li><li> Another example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a></em>. If you are in the forest, in just the right spot, and throw the knife or golden egg at a tree, it bounces back, hitting you in the face and killing you instantly. The game then tells you that you seem like a good guy, so it will give you another chance and automatically restarts for you. You then appear, alive, in the forest, right where you were before, but without any of your belongings. In front of you, whatever you used to kill yourself will be right in front of you. You pick it up, throw it at the tree again, it hits you in the face again, killing you again. The third or fourth time you do this  or kill yourself in any way three or four times in a row  the game gives you the message "You are obviously unstable" and gives you the game over message.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">notoriously cruel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> text adventure also does this if you, as Ford Prefect, negate the events of the game by not saving Arthur Dent from the Earth's destruction in the first place. It is particularly notable for causing chaos and consternation among players by actually quitting the game in MID-SENTENCE.
</li><li> Quitting the game became a less acceptable option over time at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a>, but the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter">Enchanter</a></em> Trilogy, sequel to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a></em> Trilogy, kept up the tradition of having special ways to die. In all three games, it is possible to take actions that not only cause you to fail your mission, but make the world substantially worse off than it was before. Thus, your score displayed at the game over prompt, which normally would be some score taken out of a total (100 out of 400, say) and give you a rank dependent on your score (from "Charlatan" to "Enchanter" to "Sorcerer" to "Archmage"), would instead become a score of -100 and your rank would be "Menace to Society". In the original game, <em>Enchanter</em>, one earned this rank for releasing a powerful Lovecraftian demon upon the land; in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a></em>, one earned this rank for successfully tracking down your demon-possessed mentor and allowing the demon to transfer itself to your far more powerful body; and in the finale, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spellbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a></em>, it was revealed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">entire plot of the game was a cunning trap</a> and that actually succeeding in your goal would grant you this rank if you didn't see the ruse in time.
</li></ul></li><li> In the computer game version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a>'s <em>The Fourth Protocol</em> (in 1984), you have to uncover a Soviet plot to explode a nuclear bomb near a US Air Force base in Britain, to influence the upcoming British elections and lead to the election of an anti-NATO, anti-American, anti-nuclear, pro-Soviet government. Usually, if you take too long or don't get anywhere with the plot, you get a memo telling you you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">being reassigned to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandIslands">The Falkland Islands</a>, until you get far enough. When you find the bomb, you have to defuse it, and if you mess it, up you are told the plan succeeded: Britain fell to the Soviets, and they started working on Europe from two fronts. But sometimes a different ending appears: the bomb leads to a limited nuclear war, destroying both sides and making the northern hemisphere uninhabitable. This comes "From the annals of the Australio-Indonesian Empire..."
</li><li> Failure during the finale of any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> installment from <em>Trial by Fire</em> through <em>Dragon Fire</em> will lead not only to the hero's death, but a scene of the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> breaking free to lay waste to the world.
<ul><li> This can happen several times in the second game, <em>Trial by Fire</em>. The main city is beset by four elementals over the course of the story, and three days after they individually show up, if they haven't been defeated, then you get a cutscene of them destroying the city. In addition, the final portion of the game, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> gets the sealed evil but before it is released, <em>any</em> failure or waste of time will result in the above mentioned non-standard game over.
</li><li> In the third game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">the Fighter</a> must become initiated into the Simbani tribe as part of the plot, and this means competing against your new friend and the chief's son Yesufu at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InitiationCeremony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InitiationCeremony">Initiation Ceremony</a>. The competition includes a number of events, including running, which Yesufu will always automatically beat you at until a pre-scripted moment where he is injured. If you leave him there, the Simbani, who rely on complete trust and cooperation within the tribe to survive in a harsh environment, will be horrified by your selfishness and refuse to initiate you, leading to a game over.
</li><li> In <em>Dragon Fire</em>, you can sacrifice yourself to weaken the Dragon of Doom so your companions can slay it and save Silmaria. This gives you a Game Over screen that tells you how your sacrifice won't be forgotten. Another way, if you're a mage, is to cast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Thermonuclear Blast</a> spell. This will kill you, your companions, and the dragon, and probably blow away a chunk of Silmaria in the process, but the game over screen says you did save Silmaria from destruction from the Dragon of Doom.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny">Shadow of Destiny</a></em>, when you die, you are generally given a couple of hints, and automatically continue; without the option to game over. However, it is possible in at least the first chapter to meet yourself  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheSelvesShallMeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheSelvesShallMeet">by coming into contact with yourself, you create a time paradox which erases you from existence.</a> It also fails back to the title screen. You also unlock one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> by inducing someone else to do it.
</li><li> The Interactive Fiction Game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Anchorhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Anchorhead">Anchorhead</a></em>, has a large number of grisly ways to die, but the character can go insane in true <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em> fashion by either fully reading the black tome in the church or by attacking and killing your husband during the game's finale. The character can also suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">"Endless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Torment"</a> by being sucked into the womb at any point.

However:

</li><li> Normal game overs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em> are caused by being unable to save your subject's life before time runs out. However, there are two instances where you can actively cause the subject's death.
<ul><li> If you recline the seat while the van-driver is driving, he will lose control of the vehicle and crash anyway.
</li><li> In Chapter 15, if you replace the bullet with the hard-hat, rather than the soft knit hat, it will still crash into the victim's face and crush his skull (even more brutally than the bullet would have). His ghost isn't very pleased, but it's hilarious to watch.
</li><li> In Chapter 15, if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">try manipulating <em>any</em> object in view of the killer</span>, he will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">notice you because he's also a ghost and knows of ghost tricks</span>, and will immediately shoot the victim.
</li></ul></li><li> In the video game version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>, you play most of the game as King Arthur, but the "Knights in Kombat" mini-game allows you to play as Arthur or the Black Knight. If you play as the Black Knight and win, the game immediately cuts to the Game Over screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWhiteChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWhiteChamber">the white chamber</a></em> has a full eight endings. Four are standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a> you get by getting killed before completing the story (end up in outer space, get electrocuted, die from toxic air, or decide to stay in a quarantine bay until you expire). Completing the story nets you an ending depending on how many points you've gained by certain deeds until then: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">five points nets you the Redemption ending, in which you leave the station. Less, you get the Damned ending in which you have to do everything all over again since you didn't learn.

If you don't make it through the doors fast enough, then a cutscene plays where your character of choice is trapped by the doors and the water reaches them.

Losing to Geese, the last boss, however, gives you a cutscene where he kicks you off of Geese Tower. The "Continue?" screen likewise shows your character plummeting to his death.

If you lose even one match in the "Title Defense" mode, it will say that you are no longer the champion and you must now retire.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em>'s normal game over is you serving SHODAN well, as a cyborg.

The latter is represented by a storm of pixels slowly filling the screen. If the AI wins, the pixels fill the screen to form a picture of her empty, emotionless, Gigeresque face</span>.
</li><li> If you die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em>, you will usually just watch Kyle die in a slow motion sequence. However on one level, you are required to be stealthy. If an enemy raises the alarm, you will see a cutscene of Kyle in prison just before being tortured.

<ul><li> If you shoot an instructor, the screen goes black and then transports your character to a prison cell in Leavenworth.

</li><li> And similar to the <em>America's Army</em> example above, you can attack/kill an instructor during the tutorial and get yourself court-martialed.
</li><li> In the <em>Opposing Force</em> Chapter "Friendly Fire", you can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">damage the rocket the nuke that will eventually blow up Black Mesa came in, to the point where it explodes!</span>
</li><li> Similar to the <em>Opposing Force</em> tutorial example mentioned above, this can also occur at the start of <em>Blue Shift</em> before you officially report for duty. You're given a pistol at the practice-firing range, loads of comrade security guards are around, no need to guess what happens if you decide to shoot someone.
</li></ul></li><li> Refusing the G-Man's offer at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> might be a case of this, or a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>. He expresses his regrets, and then it's not pretty.
</li><li> There's also a much earlier <em>Half-Life</em> non-standard game over during the <em>Questionable Ethics</em> level where you need to bring one of the three hiding scientists to the eye scanner to unlock the front door of the building. If you decide to kill all three of the scientists, get them killed by the malfunctioning surgery saws, or otherwise let them die before the door is unlocked, you end up trapping yourself. The game will then fade out like the G-Man endings after the last remaining scientist dies.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>, crashing a vehicle into a location that the player will not be able to recover will result in you getting terminated for "failure to preserve mission-critical resources". This also happens if a key ally like Alyx Vance dies (which is rare since they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a> and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a>).
<ul><li> Jumping off the cliffs on Highway 17 will fade to black with the note that you "demonstrated exceedingly poor judgement".
</li><li> In <em>Episode Two</em>, the G-Man's endgame reports have been replaced with Vortessent messages, the most amusing of which comments that "the Magnusson's misgivings about the Freeman were completely justified" if the player fails to protect the base.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em>, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Griffin</a> dies, you will get a special message saying "Your failure to protect Griffin doomed the rebellion, etc'', followed by just "Game Over" instead of "You Have Died". A similar thing happens if Capek kills Eos during his boss battle.
<ul><li> In <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em>. if you kill your brother during the tutorial, the Game Over screen will appear, saying "WTF, you killed your Brother!!!". Yes, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wz7_n-1AF0">with that wording<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">Tron 2.0</a></em>, if you kill any non-hostile and/or "Civilian" Programs (like Ma3a, Byte, or any character that you can talk to), you hear a voice say "Illegal program termination." Five seconds later, you get a screen with the same message.
<ul><li> If Ma3a is killed during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionMission">Protection Missions</a> or a stray shot takes out Alan when you're running your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> with him in the latter part of the game, the message is "You failed to protect Ma3a / your father." Ma3a proves difficult to defend; Alan (being possibly the most rational character in that universe) has the good sense to duck when the discs start flying.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TargetTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TargetTerror">Target Terror</a></em>, if you directly shoot the final terrorist instead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch">Dead Man's Switch</a> he's holding, the plane blows up. If you run out of lives after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoContinues">Point of No Continues</a>, the plane is shown crashing into the White House.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>: "You are a traitor to the motherland!" if you kill a Commissar in the Russian campaign, "Friendly fire will not be tolerated", if you shoot a friendly elsewhere, or "You were killed by a grenade, exploding vehicle, lethal pocket of radiation, etc."
<ul><li> If you fail the helicopter jump in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>, you get "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">Nobody makes their first Jump...</a>". If you miss your shot in the flashback level "One Shot, One Kill", "Zakhaev escaped unharmed".
</li><li> In <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, in the early mission "Team Player", if the player chooses to run in on foot rather than go into the convoy, you are promptly taken down by sniper fire with the notice "It would probably be safer to ride in the convoy."
</li><li> Failing to move past certain events in recent installments will replace the quotes with whatever you are supposed to do. One is reminded to "Hold on for dear life" after falling to death while ice climbing.
</li><li> Dying to an attack dog in <em>Modern Warfare</em> or a Banzai charger in <em>World at War</em> has the game tell you when to press the melee button/key to save yourself.
</li><li> In <em>Call of Duty 2</em>, there are two instances, one in "Red Army Training", and one (appropriately enough) in "Prisoners of War", where the game will display the message "Killing prisoners of war will not be tolerated" if the player attacks captured German soldiers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf">Operation Wolf</a></em>: Aside from "sustaining a lethal injury", the game will also end if you run out of bullets and grenades ("Since you have no ammunition left, you must join the hostages.").

But sometimes something else happens...
<ul><li> The corpse run back Blackrock Depths (or Molten Core) in Blackrock Mountain leads you past another ghost NPC, Franclorn Forgewright, whereas normally the ghost world is completely empty, even of other dead players. When you stop to talk to him, Forgewright's ghost gives you a quest that's unobtainable in the living world.

It is however, an ambush, and by attacking her illusion, she will call out the Seventh Legion to aid in killing the queen. It then becomes an ambush, and you're then asked from the top of a cliff to provide assistance and protect the queen. If her health drops to zero at any point during this mission, the screen will fade to black while Septima Tharn relishes in her victory. Despite the fact that it just reloads the mission from the point of the ambush if you fail, a Nonstandard Game Over doesn't usually happen in an MMORPG. But this is one of few instances where failure to protect an important ally will result in one.

If triggered, the machine displays "SLAM TILT" (not to be confused with the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">TILT</a>) and <em>all</em> players get a Non-Standard Game Over, <em>plus</em> any credits left in the machine are voided (newer games 80's and on don't void credits). However, modern pinball machines usually don't even have Slam Tilt switches, since modern coin mechanisms aren't vulnerable to the old exploits that Slam Tilt guards against. That said, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></em> at least has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">unique quote</a> (from the player character's girlfriend) if it happens:
<div class="indent"> "That's it! Take me home right now!"
</div></li><li> Many older electromechanical pinballs (usually ones that only support a single player) would immediately end the game rather than just the current ball on a (non-slam) tilt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/OperationThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/OperationThunder">Operation: Thunder</a></em> is infamous for abruptly <em>ending</em> the game if the player successfully completes all eleven missions and completes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode">Final Assault</a>.

Depending on the circumstances of the player's death, the game's nonstandard endings include the Panther King's minions turning Conker in as either a bag of soggy squirrel (drowning or otherwise dying underwater), bloodied chunks (gibbed), or black char (burned or electrocuted), or just a shot of Conker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOnAMilkCarton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOnAMilkCarton">Face on a Milk Carton</a> (falling down a bottomless pit).

</li><li> A number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad endings</a> are effectively this, since many games that offer them don't have "routes"; getting the bad ending is often a matter of performing a certain action and then having the consequences play out immediately (or at least with one boss fight beforehand) in the form of said ending before showing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen:

The first is that Daffy is beaten up by his superiors and kicked out of the office as he's told to look for another job, the second shows Cadet Porky given the job to defeat Marvin while Daffy is given the duty of being a janitor. Both of these end with Daffy walking down the street as "Game Over" pops on the sceeen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a></em> has exactly <em>one</em> of these. There's a quest in which you have to locate a healing elixir in the Cave of Bad Dreams. After completing the cave's obstacle course, you are offered massive sums of cash. If you accept this, you will find yourself sitting on a luxury yacht with a pile of cash the size of a small building. The implication is that Rayman lets his greed get the best of him and decides to simply let the pirates enslave everybody while he lies around enjoying his money. The game snaps you back immediately instead of ending the game though, and will cycle through until you pick the right option. In some ports of the game, Rayman just takes the potion automatically, though.

In <em>Abe's Oddysee</em>, if you fail to save over 50 Mudokons, Abe will be sliced and diced through a meat saw in Rupture Farms. In <em>Abe's Exoddus</em>, again, failing to save enough Mudokons, will leave Abe in the hands of the Brewmaster, who will strap him down and pass electricity through his body to extract his tears. Eventually, the electricity gets turned up too high and he will be electrocuted. In <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>, failing to obtain a certain level of Quarma will leave both Munch and Abe to be mauled by Fuzzles, who also alert the Vykkers as to their whereabouts. Abe will be killed and his head hung on a wall which Munch has an even worse fate: He is strapped down, while his lungs are forcibly removed <em>while he is still fully conscious</em> so that they can be given to the ailing Glukkon queen.

The US and NATO several times considered and rejected proposals to move to no-first-use (most recently in 1999 on a motion by Germany). In contrast, the USSR actually <em>did</em> have a no-first-use policy from time to time (although they never announced it). This shows in their respective targeting: US missiles were targeted counterforce (aimed at known Soviet missile sites) while Soviet missiles were targeted countervalue (aimed at US and other NATO cities and sites of economic value).</span> (Conversely, when playing as NATO, your goal is to defend yourself for a requisite number of turns; if you ever enter the Warsaw Pact territory, the enemy will start a global nuclear war.

<ul><li> The game has the famous opera scene that Celes takes the lead in. As she sings her lines, you have to choose the next set of lines for her to sing, and if you choose the wrong set, she botches the play. If you screw up 4 times, the game mocks you for failing and you get a game over.
</li><li> In the World of Ruin, after meeting Sabin in Tzen, failing to save the child from the building within the time limit causes the house to collapse with Celes still inside.
</li><li> The optional dungeon inside Zone Eater's belly in the World of Ruin, one room has a collapsing ceiling which you must move to an open gap or you'll be crushed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, if you don't get out of the reactor in the opening mission before it blows up, it simply blows up with you inside it.
</li><li> Quite a few in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>.
<ul><li> Failing to complete either the Fire Cavern dungeon or the escape from Dollet before the expiration of the time limit imposed in those missions will result in a Game Over.
</li><li> When escaping the D-District Prison, there's a scene where you have to walk Squall across a bridge. If he falls off the bridge, the game ends immediately.
</li><li> At the Missile Base, failure to alter the coordinates of several missiles results in a scene where your home is promptly obliterated by said missiles without even so much as a time limit. Also, the obvious Non-Standard Game Over of not taking out the boss of the dungeon before the Missile Base blows up.
</li><li> Also, failing to rescue Rinoa in time leaves her floating off into space forever, and in the boss fight with Adel, she uses Rinoa as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a>, draining HP to heal herself. Killing Rinoa through attacks that hit all enemies or by letting Adel drain all her HP results in game over.
</li><li> It is even possible to botch the train hijacking mission early in the game and result in the two trains colliding, although you are given the choice of not taking the Game Over by retrying the mission. However, you lose the opportunity to raise your SeeD rank, and if you fail enough times, your SeeD rank will actually drop.
</li><li> Same choice scenario with the paratrooper punching match in the Battle of the Gardens at the end of Disc 2, except there's no penalty for retrying. Not only that, but you have the option to try again with +200 HP and each time you fail, the game gives you a tip that could help you win that time, though some are more useful than others.
</li><li> Same with the Laguna scenario when he's fighting the Ruby Dragon. If the Ruby Dragon takes all of his HP, then you can chose either "I'm done for" or "Not yet!" If you choose the former, it's a Game Over, but "Not yet!" allows you try again. There's no penalty and you can do it as many times as necessary.
</li></ul></li><li> There are two instant-lose conditions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> at the start of the Evil Forest section. Garnet and then Vivi get abducted by a monster, and you have to kill it to free them. During each fight, the monster sucks up Garnet and Vivi's HP, and if their HP hits zero, they die and the game ends. Also, in the fight against Black Waltz #2, it will not attack Garnet. However, if all the other party members are KO'd, it will cast Sleep on Garnet and spirit her away, ending the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you take too long during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final fight against Sin</span>, it will unleash its Overdrive "Giga-Graviton," which will destroy the airship you're standing on, instantly killing your party. You can't even use an Aeon to take the hit for you.
</li></ul></li><li> Take too long to destroy Vegnagun in the second-to-last battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, and you get to watch Shuyin fire it, obliterating Spira.
</li><li> This is actually the <em>only</em> way to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, by running out of time left for the world. The player is then given the choice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">start over with all of their accumulated power and equipment</a>.
</li><li> And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> you have a few choices, such as crashing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar">Regalia</a> during take off and landing, falling down from the bridge (in case of Regalia Type D (monster truck) in 1.12 update)or failing to keep up with Ardyn's car. Fortunately, this game offers a friendly warning whenever an NSGO is imminent.
</li><li> In the latest DLC, <em>Episode Ignis</em>, there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">alternate path</a> called the Extra Verse, which you unlock by beating the episode once. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This scenario takes Ignis to the keep where the Crystal is being held, should you choose the "Play Along" option which wasn't available before. Ignis still tries to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield">Ring of the Lucii</a> to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ardyn</a>, and should you choose "Give Up" or lose the battle, a short scene plays out in which Ardyn gloats about his plans, taunts the badly wounded Ignis, and walks away. Ignis dies, lamenting how he was unable to save or even die with Noctis—giving you a bad ending and the Game Over screen</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em> has a case of a Nonstandard Game Over that's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad ending</a>. A still screen depicting an army of demons taking over the world can be seen in one of two ways: either by choosing not to unseal the gate to the final dungeon, or failing to break out of the final boss's paralysis spell.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em> also has a case of a Nonstandard Game Over, which doubled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad ending</a>. It was achieved by submitting to the final boss and relinquishing Ryu's powers instead of fighting against her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIV">Breath of Fire IV</a></em> also has a case of a Nonstandard Game Over, which (again) doubled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad ending</a>. It featured Ryu ultimately agreeing with Fou-Lu, merging with him instead of battling him, and caused the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">control the final boss</a> against the entirety of your former party. Destroying them was quick and brutal, and afterwards the game left no doubt in the player's mind as to the fate of humanity (it was blown up).
</li><li> Continuing this tradition, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter">Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</a></em> has one when you max out your D-Counter and select The End.

</li><li> In the <em>Blood and Wine</em> expansion, choosing to seek out the Unseen Elder vampire and angering him by asking too many questions leads to him killing Geralt before he can draw his sword.

You're then given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen reading "You have died in prison."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreasureOfTheRudra">Treasure of the Rudra</a></em>, you get one when you are at the bio tanks and input the wrong combination to stop the pollution.

The credits abruptly begin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardGag">sped up</a> and ends with "Thanks for playing...?", with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">angry face next to the message.</a>
</li><li> Abusing Data Hack in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games">.hack</a></em> tetrology causes the game to glitch and malfunction as your rate of viral infection increased. Allow your infection rate to exceed 100%, and risk the possibility of suffering a <strong>SYSTEM ERROR</strong>. The bonus dungeon in <em>Quarantine</em> required you to risk this, as almost every single enemy is infected and requires a data drain just to give a chance to kill it, and you will almost always be at 100%.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, the protagonist is immortal... with a few exceptions. Making the Lady of Pain angry can do this. Do it once, and she punishes you by sending you to a special Maze. That's the lenient punishment, and her way of saying, "this is a warning". Make her mad a second time, and that's it. Game Over. Lothar, the master necromancer can do this too, as he's mastered the arts of death just that well, and he has an even shorter fuse. By plot, you are bound to resurrect each time you are killed, often with little more than a snarky comment from one of your party members. There are two "deaths" from which you can't recover, though: sitting on the throne of the Silent King, which dooms you to rule over the Catacombs forever, or pestering a Gorgon enough for her to get pissed and petrify you.
</li><li> Signing a ceasefire with a major enemy group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a> 3</em> results in a sequence of events over several missions in which the situation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">degrades until your army dies a horrible death</a>. In the same game, should a particular character be defeated in action, its defeat causes the end of all existence, complete with a special game over screen.
</li><li> Several of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> games have non-standard bad endings if the player ever abuses the vampiric side his character is cursed with in later parts of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSaga">Metal Saga</a></em> features several Nonstandard Game Overs, usually for humor and initiated with a single conversation. The very first appears before the game even begins, when the player character's mother asks if he'd like to stay and work in the family garage instead of embarking on a quest for fame and fortune. If the player agrees, an epilogue detailing the rest of the character's life (which is entirely un-noteworthy) begins and the game ends. The player character may also marry his first prospective party member at any time simply by asking her, at which point they both quit adventuring to start a family.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestI">Dragon Quest</a></em>, when you finally face the Dragonlord, he offers you a chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">join him and rule half the world</a>. Smart players select "no" and get on with the battle, but if you choose "yes" (and confirm it): "Then half of this world is thine, half of the darkness, and... If thou dies I can bring thee back for another attempt without loss of thy deeds to date." Then the screen turns red. "Thy journey is over. Take now a long, long rest. Hahahaha..." Then you're dead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">It's been rumored</a> that this also erases your game data, but that is not correct.

As with before, refusing his offer commences the final battle. If you accept the offer, on the other hand, the Dragonlord will give you the deepest and darkest recesses of the world to reign over...in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">your subterranean tomb</a>. Afterwards, the game returns to the title screen.

However, one can earn a Non-Standard Game Over simply by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">choosing not to interfere with Euphemia's special administrative region, which goes off successfully, avoiding the slaughter from the TV show completely</span>.

Refuse twice and the screen fades to a sepia tone, accompanied with the text "And so, the world drifted towards its fated destruction." You are then given the option of continuing from the beginning of the conversation. This is ironic because the destruction it is describing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is the slow erosion described in the second game, due to alchemy not being unlocked, but you assume it is because alchemy WAS unlocked that the world ended.</span> <em>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</em> justifies it, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after lighting three out of four lighthouses, the world's erosion at the hands of Alchemy gets direr until the fourth one is lit.

If you choose to pay in Macca, but don't have enough of it, he'll let you come back to life anyway, but if you die again before getting enough Macca to pay off the debt, you're treated to a unique sequence in which Charon notes that he can't revive you and has your soul thrown aside. You can also choose to not be brought back to life, but instead to wait in line like the many other (billions) souls. He then points out that you'll be waiting for eons, if not longer, to be resurrected, and come on, it's just a little money, right? If you still choose to wait, he tells you to get in line and the game ends.

If the deadline passes and you didn't save the person, said person will die when the fog is at its heaviest. Your hero collapses and you are then given the option to exit to the title screen or flash back seven days to try again. The stated in-game reason for this Game Over is not because the person dies (though that's obviously the motivation), but because the death frustrates any further attempts by the hero to investigate the murders due to lack of clues or information. And the very last person — if you fail, instead, one of the characters calls the hero to tell them that shadows are coming out of the TV, and suddenly cuts off with a scream.

</li><li> Getting caught by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paper Macho Chain Chomp</span> at any point during the Green Streamer quest results in you and/or everyone else with you getting eaten and instantly ends the game.
</li><li> Failing the final "Sudden Death" minigame during "Shy Guys Finish Last" results in Mario getting shot out of a cannon into the horizon as Olivia panics in the studio.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> RPG for the SNES, there is one battle where you're pitted against your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind controlled</a> friends. Defeat them, and you get a screen telling you that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">you're a bad friend</a>, and a game over. Losing to any of the final dungeon's bosses gives you a Nonstandard Game Over as well; each boss has a different one.

Saying "yes" results in a short (and usually somewhat comedic) ending, then puts you back on the world map.

<ul><li> During Archangel's recruitment mission, you can side with the mercenaries hunting him down. Doing so results in Archangel's death and a Critical Mission Failure.
</li><li> During Samara's loyalty mission, you can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">recruit Morinth instead of Samara</span>. Once aboard the Normandy, you then have the option to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seduce Morinth</span>. Doing so causes things to end about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">as well as you'd expect</a>.
</li><li> Joker will meet an untimely end at the hands of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Collectors if you rush too quickly during their attack and abduction of the Normandy crew</span>.
</li><li> Not unlocking the valves fast enough for your chosen Tech expert during the Suicide Mission will lead to an abrupt Game Over.
</li><li> If you take too long to defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">David</span> during the final boss fight in the Overlord DLC, it will upload to the Normandy and infect EDI.
</li><li> Wait for the Arrival Countdown to hit Zero during the second scene and Shepard will experience what is a rapid glimpse of Reapers coming down on the galaxy to cleanse all life.
</li><li> You can technically win the game, yet still get one of these. A normal win allows you to continue playing in the aftermath for missions you didn't do or play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> as it comes out, and will give you the option to upload the storyline into Mass Effect 3. But if you didn't bother to prepare at all for the suicide mission <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(not getting certain ship upgrades, or doing any loyalty missions)</span>, all of your party members die by the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>, along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Commander Shepard</a></em>. That's just not very conducive to epilogue play, but you <em>did</em> technically win the game (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">if you want to call that "winning"</a>). However, it still counts as a nonstandard game over since a save game with an ending where Shepard dies cannot be imported into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, and is pretty much the <em>only</em> story-possibility or choice that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> directly contradicts.
</li></ul></li><li> There's many more in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any time an objective with a health bar is destroyed.
</li><li> If you take too long to use the laser designator on the Reaper-Destroyer during Priority: Rannoch, it'll end up destroying the quarian fleet.
</li><li> If you're unable to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convince the Illusive Man to shoot himself</span>, failing to take the Renegade interrupt(s) provided results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him</span> shooting and killing Shepard.
</li><li> Taking too long to make the final decision results in the destruction of the Crucible.
</li><li> In the Omega DLC, taking too long on the final segment will result in Aria's death.
</li><li> During the Citadel DLC, you're required to infiltrate a party at a casino. Being detected is a Critical Mission Failure.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteSpace">Infinite Space</a></em>, you wind up in some sort of negative space where it's unhealthy to stay. You are presented with three options, and in two of the options you slowly drift around, with the situation getting worse and worse. You think you will get rescued or catch a lucky break, but instead your party poofs into nothingness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> uses this trope often:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em>, Tinto City gets overrun by zombies, and it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">at this point</a> that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">poor kid</a> just decides that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">he can't handle it anymore</a>. This can result in him (and his adopted sister) deciding to cut their losses and make a mad dash for safety. Of course, the core of your several-dozen-strong entourage comes after you once they realize you're gone. If you persist in leaving, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the leaders of your army will die. From here, if you change your mind and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">decide to go back</a>, said dead person will be replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">his son.</a></span> The hero's second-in-command will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">Bright Slap</a> him and ask him to come back one last time. If you leave the town to the south, the screen will fade slowly and be replaced by a still picture of a log cabin, indicating that the hero and his sister have chosen to live away from society, in order to have a so-called 'normal life' without wars or fighting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> you can elect to stay and make a life for yourself and your two companions on a deserted island as opposed to looking for a way to escape. This is a particularily insidious one since it never ends; you are placed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> repeating the same actions over and over, leading some players to think that they are still playing the game and are stuck. It does hint that something's different by replacing the character portraits with black and white sketches and removing the local save point. Also on the scene if you don't use the Rune of Punishment and let your flagship get rammed by the enemy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you accept Salum Barows' suggestion of taking the throne for yourself instead of rescuing the rightful heir, you'll get a cutscene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">said heir is informed that you were assassinated</a>.
</li><li> If you fail to defeat Roy in a duel, you're put into a coma from the injuries, and your group forces Roy to take your place, but soon the army's overrun. "Perhaps it's a good thing that he won't wake up."

But during two points of the main quest (the battle at Bruma and the final mission in the Imperial City), he loses his essential status, and if he dies, it shows a few lines of text and prompts you to reload. Made worse by a glitch that prevents him from equipping proper armor during the former event, forcing you to exploit another glitch to keep him alive.

The only way in involves passing through a pacification spell. You are warned about this several times and told to go get a potion to protect yourself. However, nothing stops you from simply walking in whereupon you fall unconscious.

</li><li> Normally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">the Death Star blowing up</a> is something to celebrate, but in the <em>Rogue Leader</em> bonus mission "Triumph of the Empire", you play as Darth Vader during the Death Star assault and your objective is to destroy the Rebels under a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">time limit</a>. Take too long and the Death Star explosion becomes your Mission Failed cutscene.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1985 game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BalanceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BalanceOfPower">Balance Of Power</a>,</em> pushing too hard in international negotiations would result in an immediate end to the game, with a black screen displaying the message: <em>"You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure."</em>
</li><li> In <em>F/A-18 Hornet</em>, if you land or eject in enemy territory, you get captured and are listed as "Missing in Action". If you cause any collateral damage, you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtMartialed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtMartialed">Court-Martialed</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingVsTieFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingVsTieFighter">X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter</a></em>, if you fail at a mission (rather than just dying, ejecting, or hyperspacing out of there before the mission's done), you'll be treated to some tragic music. Depending on how well you did, you might be the sole survivor, or your enemy might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomp</a> you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease">Papers, Please</a></em>, there are a few ways that the game can end instantly, booting you back to the title screen without an ending. These include:
<ul><li> Failing to disarm a bomb on day 15
</li><li> Touching the poisonous powder on day 20
</li><li> Getting hit by a grenade from a suicide attacker on day 21
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Failing to kill the EZIC rebel attacking your booth on day 31, if you did not sufficiently cooperate with EZIC</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrikeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrikeCommander">Strike Commander</a></em>: Failing to keep the mercenary squadron you are in charge of in the black financially will lead to the bank foreclosing on your base and putting it up for sale. The squadron disbands and the game ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacificStrike">Pacific Strike</a></em>: If you are inept enough to let enemy Japanese planes sink both the <em>USS Enterprise</em> and the carrier assigned to replace it the game immediately ends in defeat for the US Navy and Hawaii is ceded to Japan as part of the terms of the peace treaty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em>:
<ul><li> In both games, jumping out without being authorized to do so will result in a court-martial for desertion.
</li><li> In the second game there's a mission in which you go undercover among NTF, and you are ordered to destroy a civilian transport. Regardless of if you comply or not, your cover is blown and the other pilots will turn hostile. Once you've eliminated them, reinforcements will arrive to get you out. If you destroyed the transport, the mission will be considered as a failure and you will be court-martialed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pilotwings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pilotwings">Pilotwings</a></em>: In both of the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">helicopter missions</a>, your craft is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. Get hit once, and your chopper is instantly busted and plummets to the ground, abruptly ending the game. Since you don't even get any message from your instructors, the disturbing implication is that the player character <em>perished</em>.
</li><li> <em>Space Shuttle Project</em> had it possible to get a game over before the game even begins. The first thing you have to do is input a password that the game gives you, either the one it shows you, which starts a new game, or a password from a previous game. Every time you fail to put in a proper code, you lose a life. Lose all your lives on this screen, and the Game Over newspaper has a headline that declares "Impostor Astronauts Arrested."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1">The Sims</a></em>: At the very start of the "Get a Life" mode in the console versions, you can explore your dream house as you see fit before you join your mate in the tub.

<ul><li> <em>Super Bases Loaded</em> for the SNES. In this particular sports game, you end up getting the Non-Standard Game Over screen, should the CPU completely blow you out by getting 9 runs straight. It will not even wait for you to make it to 9 innings. Instead, it will briefly freeze, then show someone from your team kneeling in defeat, with the word "Blowout" over their head, with some sad music. From there, it will go to the scoreboard, and the words "Blowout Game" will appear. From there, it will promptly go back to the title screen.
</li><li> <em>Baseball Stars</em> uses a similar "mercy rule", ending the game if either team is ahead by ten or more runs at any point. So did Sega's <em>Sports Talk Baseball</em> for the Genesis. It was explicitly called a "10-run Rule", and the talking commentator would say the team won "by domination".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioSuperstarBaseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioSuperstarBaseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioSuperSluggers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioSuperSluggers">Mario Super Sluggers</a></em> have a rule (which can be disabled in normal game modes, but is always active in story mode) where being 10 runs or more ahead at the end of an inning ends the game; however, if the visiting team is 10 runs ahead in the top of the inning, the home team still gets the bottom of the inning to reduce the deficit under 10 (for example, 15-0 to 15-6) before the rule kicks in.
</li><li> In <em>Blitz: The League 2</em>, getting Franchise injured in Prison Ball will end the game, as you have ruined your career. Unlike in other modes of the game, Prison Ball will not let you perform triage if an injury occurs.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a>: Double Agent</em>, if you fail the final minigame-for-a-boss, you are treated to a very disturbingly realistic portrayal of emergency services and news helicopters flying over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Manhattan as a smoking ruin after a nuclear blast.</span>
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a></em> game, you are on a training facility, and at a certain point you get a gun. If you turn back and kill an officer, you get fired. You also get fired if you attack Grimsdottir in the beginning of the level. Same for any level with friendlies or other NPC's you are required to keep alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> used the Nonstandard Game Over as a plot device on one occasion, being told before a possibly-fatal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Minigame">Minigame</a> that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">there are no continues, my friend...</a>". And, of course, dying results in a non-standard game over screen — with no CONTINUE option. A player would have to quit the game and reload before they could try again. The game can go even further to psych out the player here. If you haven't saved in a while, the game will detect this and call you out on it. "You really wanna travel down that long road again?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, during the Tanker chapter, if Snake gets caught sneaking around in the holds during the Commandant's speech, the player is shown the soldiers in whatever room he's in taking Snake into custody before "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>" is displayed.
</li><li> MGS2 uses a <em>completely different</em> "Game Over" screen for the solo Raiden missions that's unlike the "Game Over" screen when playing as Snake or even as Snake/Raiden later in the game. Around the time both characters join forces, the player learns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">why this is.</a>
</li><li> Also from <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> late in the Tanker chapter where you need to escort Otacon's younger half-sister Emma.

He's supposed to survive the events of the game, but in one occasion you can kill him after he's been knocked out in a cutscene. If you do so, you'll have Colonel Campbell, from the <em>future</em>, shout "Snake, what have you done? You changed the future!! You've created a time paradox!", and the words "OCELOT IS DEAD" will appear, instead of the usual game over text, before gradually changing into "TIME PARADOX". This also applies to other characters whose actions affect the rest of the series, but Ocelot is the most notable. You even get a achievement for this in the HD Version.
</li><li> There's a few cases in <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and its sequel, in particular, where you get a wildly different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformalEulogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformalEulogy">Informal Eulogy</a> depending on the circumstances. Crash into the tripwires surrounding Baker, and Ocelot will call you an idiot/fool depending on if you're playing the remake or not. Fail the torture, and not only will your CONTINUE option be missing, but you'll get to hear Liquid yell at Ocelot for getting carried away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and botching another interrogation</span>. Die during the final battle in <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> after your "support" team has dropped their façade, and they'll laugh at your failure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, die during the final battle &amp; you will be given the choice to "Continue" or "Exist". Choose the latter, and you will hear Ocelot tell you "It's not over yet, Snake!" and you will have to choose again, only "Exist" will have returned to the traditional "Exit".
</li><li> If, in the VR missions centered around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Gurlugon</a>, you get hit by one of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> while wearing the BDU, you get <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ker0WQAIf88">possibly the most bizarre game over sequence in the entire series<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Rather than Snake dying, there are other ways you can get a Game Over. If, for example, you kill Johnny in <em>MGS4</em>, Otacon will shout "Snake, what did you just do? Have you lost your mind?!", and as soon as the Game Over screen appears, Otacon says "Oh no! What are we going to do now, Snake?"
</li><li> There's a few ways to get one of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>.
<ul><li> If Ishmael dies in the tutorial level, you'll get a "Time Paradox" message <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">foreshadowing the fact that he's the real Big Boss</span>.
</li><li> You'll also get one of these if you kill one of your own men while on Mother Base by throwing them into the ocean/off a high enough ledge that can kill them, where Ocelot screams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">"Boss, have you lost your mind?!"</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Maybe you're not the Big Boss we hoped for after all.".</span>
</li><li> In Mission 1, where you have to rescue Miller, Ocelot tells you he only has about 3 days to live. If you wait 3 days, either by using the Phantom Cigar or simply by taking too long, he will be unresponsive when you trigger his cutscene, and when Snake lets go of his face, it will stiffly lull to a downward position, causing Snake to scream in agony and Ocelot to solemnly inform you that Miller has died from extensive blood loss due to his severed limbs. This also results in a "Time Paradox" message.
</li><li> Killing any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> in Africa causes the screen to flash red and the camera to focus on the corpse before going to the normal game over screen.
</li><li> Killing Eli in Mission 23 will also result in a Time Paradox message. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Liquid Snake</a>.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> has quite a few of these. If you let Zsasz see you when he has the guard in the electric chair, true to his word, he electrocutes him. If Batman is in Joker Venom for too long, he laughs himself to death. If Batman doesn't set off his trap for Killer Croc, we are treated to a first-person shot of Croc lunging at his head, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">along with the sound of bones getting crushed</a>. There are several more examples, but one of the more humorous ones is when Zsasz has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Young</span> trapped in his arms; if you are seen, miss your Batarang, or if you wait too long, Zsasz kills her, with the Joker mocking you.

</li><li> <strong>Arrested</strong>: Ayano left too much evidence behind, and the police arrested her.
</li><li> <strong>Expelled</strong>: Ayano behaved badly in front of the teachers once too often, and the Guidance Counseller lost patience and expelled her.
</li></ul></li><li> Less common game overs are the following:
<ul><li> <strong>Apprehended</strong>: You killed someone in front of the wrong person, and paid for it.

</li></ul></li><li> And then there's SNAP Mode, which can best be described as a playable game over (thus far only unlocked if one gets the 'Heartbroken' Ending, but planned for some of the others): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in which Yandere-chan, your player character, having, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">snapped</a>, finds a knife and proceeds to kill Senpai and then herself, beating anyone who's in her path to death with her bare hands in the process</span>.

Waerjak is given the option of attacking them and claiming their garrison; if he does so, his followers will turn on him, proclaiming his philosophy of community to be a lie. This is a recurring element throughout the campaigns, made easier by the fact that all events are narrated instead of animated, resulting in various different scenarios that you wouldn't normally see in a game. If Lysander, for example, were to attack Glen Garrison to rescue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s mother (instead of finding a way around it), the commander would notify him that he sent his men to execute her. If Elwyn takes the red ship instead of the blue one, Shaera would commit suicide, believing that he died (granted, this is an unnecessary complication of the gameplay, since Harke will bribe the crew to switch the sails, and Elwyn arrives just in time to save the girl anyway, making the outcome pretty much the same).

For one quest in the main storyline, you end up working for two nobles simultaneously, and your actions during the quest require you to betray them both. Treason is a crime punishable by death, and that might make you worried. However, in each case, there are no witnesses and no evidence pointing to you, so neither of them would even suspect you unless you actually confessed. Believe it or not, there's an option that lets you do that when you finish the quest and report back to them.

If you present it too early, i.e. before the real murderer admits that he was hiding it, you're told that the trial was unwinnable from that point onward, and the word "Guilty" appears on a black background.
</li><li> In <em>Justice for All</em>, right near the end of the 4th case, you're given a chance to show a particular piece of evidence to a particular person.

<ul><li> Under some partners rules variants of Spades, getting a "Boston" run on your team (losing all thirteen tricks) is an automatic game loss.
</li><li> In Blackjack, if any player or the dealer gets a hand worth exactly 21 in just their first two cards (a "blackjack"), that player automatically wins. Their opponent(s), as a result, all automatically lose (multiple players with blackjack tie).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, the standard loss condition occurs when your opponent brings your life total to zero. However, there are other ways to lose the game:
<ul><li> If you are forced to draw a card when there are no cards remaining in your library, you are "decked" and lose the game.
</li><li> Creatures with the Infect ability, rather than dealing life damage to a player, inflicts that player with poison counters. A player with ten poison counters loses the game.
</li><li> Certain cards cause you to win or lose in unusual circumstances; for instance, the Near-Death Experience card, which allows you to win if you have exactly 1 life remaining in your upkeep step.
</li><li> There's a story out there that said that when <em>Time Walk</em> was still in development, its ability was phrased as 'opponent loses next turn'. It was <em>intended</em> to make an opponent skip his turn... but playtesters interpreted it as 'opponent loses <em>the game</em> on his next turn'. Suddenly, you could immediately lose the game because of a two-mana spell. The card text was quickly revised to clarify its intent, and later cards that give you instant wins usually have highly specific requirements (decking out, having 10 more life than your starting total, having only one life, and so on) or are extremely expensive to invoke, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=288992">Door to Nothingness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Except for the card "Divine Intervention" which makes every cleric go up a level, and <em>explicitly</em> states you can win the game this way (and lets you mock all the other players if you win).

A common "nonstandard" game ending involved a card called Writ of Accountability. If you exceeded any of the limits outlined by the card, and your opponent activated the card on you, you instantly lost the game, with a score of 0 (and if only one player remained—which nearly always was the case—that player scored the full 100 points needed to win). There were a few other cases where you could lose the game instantly (such as calling "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E26S6E1TimesArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E26S6E1TimesArrow">Devidian Door</a>", then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">being caught without a Devidian Door in hand when it came time to show it</a>), but that was perhaps the best known.

In the Core set, there are two cards that can circumvent this scenario:
<ul><li> There's one Dark Side objective ("Heart of the Empire") that has 10 Damage capacity and gives extra start-up resources, but when it is destroyed, the Dark Side loses automatically. Good to get late game, but an obvious target when opening the game with that objective.
</li><li> The Light Side has an enhancement ("Trench Run") that allows the player to attack that card for 10 Damage instead to win the game. Of course if the card doesn't come up early enough in the game there's no use in switching tactics when enough damage has already been dealt to the Dark Side objectives.

However even in its earliest days, Exodia existed as an alternative win condition. Since then several cards have been printed, most of which fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.

<ul><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books feature conclusions punctuated by something other than <strong>The End</strong>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">third book in the series</a>, <em>By Balloon to the Sahara</em>, has a few: <strong>A Chilling End</strong> for when your character is trapped under an avalanche, <strong>The (BLAT!) End</strong> for when aliens disintegrate you with a laser gun, and even <strong>The Beginning</strong>, among several others.
</li><li> <em>The Mystery of Chimney Rock</em> probably plays this trope the straightest:
<ul><li> One ending has you leaving the haunted house after encountering a ghostly creature who threatens you with his fate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookBack">if you ever look back at the house</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9jltq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9jltq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9jltq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Another equally bad ending implies he was a former inhabitant of the house who died after falling off the roof.</span> If you don't like that ending, you can choose to look back one last time anyway, the resulting page of which simply has a bloodcurdling scream down the page in giant letters followed by a <strong>THUNK</strong>.
</li><li> Another ending has your character accidentally breaking the resident witch's china cat and being cursed to pick up the pieces for all eternity, complete with <strong>There Is No End</strong>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf">Lone Wolf</a> adventure, The Caverns of Kalte, if you either confront Vonotar without finding Loi-Kymar or take too long to slay the Akraa'neonor, Vonotar sounds the alarm and alerts all of Ikaya to your presence, forcing you to flee. You escape and make it back to your ship unharmed, but without capturing Vonotar, and the adventure ends here. This is the only time in the entire series where you can fail your mission but you're still alive, free, and in reasonably good health and spirits, there are no obvious consequences for your failure for Sommerlund or any of the free kingdoms of Magnamund, and there is absolutely nothing preventing you from trying again at a future date. No attempt was ever made to explain what's preventing you, in this one instance, from going on later adventures.
<ul><li> Surprisingly, Aboard The Intrepid, the book 12 bonus adventure, has <em>two</em> of these. How it normally unfolds is that the stranger you recently rescued tells you about a fantastic treasure-filled island, you have to decide whether to search for this island, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">you end up searching for and eventually finding it regardless of your choice</a>, and the decisions you make from there determine how much treasure you obtain and how much of a human cost you pay for it. However, if you decide not to go, refuse to budge on this decision, and <em>then</em> survive the treachery of one of your crewmen (who really, <em>really</em> wants to go to this place for reasons that are not immediately clear), you can quietly return to Holmgard without ever seeking out the island, and the book will acknowledge it as a "successful completion" to your adventure. A second possibility is that you make some truly boneheaded decisions after your boatswain is found murdered, resulting in you fighting your first mate and a total of <em>twenty</em> sailors to the death. The adventure ends after this fight regardless of how it goes; even if you win (which is just about inconceivable), the book simply says "Your adventure is over".

In game show parlance, the Non-Standard Game Over is, in its broadest sense, a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>, where a contestant performs so poorly that he is either disqualified or causes a situation where the leaders score makes it mathematically impossible for him/her to catch up. In several game shows, the game is ended early, the losing contestant is given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">Consolation Prizes</a>, and the winner plays the bonus game early.
<p></p><ul><li> A number of quiz shows from the late 1960s and early 1970s — including the <em>Who, What or Where Game</em> and the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury">Sale of the Century</a></em> — had rules where falling below zero at any time immediately eliminated that player from further play. These games spotted the players a small bankroll ($20 for <em>$otC</em>, $125 for the betting-type <em>3 Ws</em>) and, like <em>Jeopardy!</em>, money was deducted for incorrect answers. But enough incorrect answers meant falling to or below $0 and, per the rules, meant they were eliminated immediately. The "$0 means goodbye" rule was eliminated for the more familiar 1983 <em>$otC</em> and the <em>3 Ws</em> 1990 remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChallengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChallengers">The Challengers</a></em>. With the earlier incarnations, the standard "game over" is at the end of the front game of <em>$otC</em> (we've just played the last question, here's the scores, here's our champion) or, on the <em>3 Ws</em>, after the day's final category is played with all three contestants participating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blockbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blockbusters">Blockbusters</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>, called "Gold Rush" (or "Gold Run"), required players to make a side-to-side chain on a game board by answering questions within a 60-second time limit; an incorrect answer blocked the progress and required the contestant to work his/her way around. The trope kicked into effect for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">just the first few weeks of the series' run</a> — if, because of enough wrong answers, there was no longer a way to make a side-to-side connection before the 60-second time limit expired, the game ended early. The trope no longer was in effect after the bonus round was tweaked; the contestant could still win <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">consolation cash</a> by continuing to answer questions until the time limit expired.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BodyLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BodyLanguage">Body Language</a></em>, a charades game show, was broken down into two parts. The first had a contestant guessing up to ten words at $100 per word in 60 seconds, followed by another 20-second round with three words played for 10 times the amount the contestant won previously. Giving an illegal clue (talking or using a prop) in the second part immediately ended the round in failure even if any words were left over; the bonus round was also not played if, by rare happenstance, the contestant failed to guess even one word in the first part.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CardSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CardSharks">Card Sharks</a></em>, the Money Cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> automatically ended prior to the Big Bet card if, while on the second row, the contestant busted - i.e., bet everything on an incorrect hunch. (On the NBC version, this was marked by a harsh buzzer followed by a truncated version of <em>The Price is Right</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingHorns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LosingHorns">losing horns</a>). Quite a few times, there were players who "two-card busted" (meaning they blew everything on the first card, then — with the card moved immediately to the second row and the player given a new bankroll — immediately lost everything on their next call of the cards). This was also originally possible if the next card was of the same value as the previous one; it was originally ruled as a loss, but on later episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">the next card being of the same value resulted in neither a gain nor a loss</a> (referred to in-show as a "push").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>: In the first four seasons of the current syndicated version, the game had no point goal and consisted of three rounds at normal point values with a fourth round at triple the points. This meant the game could end before one team had a chance to steal the bank due to the controlling team not coming up with enough points to win. It didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">teams had only one strike in the Triple Round</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImTelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ImTelling">I'm Telling!</a></em> usually consisted of six questions per show, the final one worth 150 points. However, if a team was leading by more than 150 when it came time for the final question, they would be declared the winners right then and there. This happened at least once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In its broadest sense, any player who has $0 or a negative cash score at the end of the "Double Jeopardy!" round ends his participation in the show early (i.e., he's not around for "Final Jeopardy!"). However, at least once on the original NBC series — the late 1960s, by most accounts — the trope truly kicked into full effect when all three players had negative cash scores and thus were ineligible for "Final Jeopardy!" No "Final Jeopardy!" was played that day, and Art Fleming spent the rest of the time talking with the contestants and the audience. The standard "game over" is with all three players participating in "Final Jeopardy!"
</li><li> A twist on the "nonstandard game over" trope is the "lock game" scenario, where the leading contestant's score at the end of "Double Jeopardy!" is more than double that of the second-place contestant ... assuming, of course, he/she does not bet more than what he'd be left with if he were incorrect and the second-place player was correct and bet enough (This is known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb">Pulling a Cliff Clavin</a>" thanks to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> episode "What is... Cliff Clavin?", when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowAppearance">Cliff goes on "Jeopardy!"</a> and loses after wagering his entire lock winnings ($22,000) in "Final Jeopardy!"). In this case, a standard "game over" is a competitive game, where the second-place contestant can still win if certain things go right (e.g., a correct answer and a wise bet, vs. the champion being wrong and forced to bet enough to cover the second-place player's wager).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple">Legends of the Hidden Temple</a></em>: The Temple Run at the end of the show had one team of two contestants navigating through the Temple to bring an artifact out in three minutes or less. If either player exited the Temple outside of the designated entrance (the stairs on the far right with the bottom of the Cave of Sighs serving as a second in Season 1 only), the team automatically lost. While this never happened, one contestant was so afraid of a Temple Guard that he jumped out of the Temple. It didn't matter since he only had half a pendant of life and needed the other half to give to the Guard for the run to to continue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em>: The 1970s version's two-part Super Match — the Audience Match followed by the Head-to-Head Match — required the contestant to match at least one of the top three answers in the Audience Match portion of the game to play the Head-to-Head portion; failure to do so ended this bonus round early. While not uncommon during the CBS and daily syndicated run, only one time did it happen on <em>Match Game PM</em> (where two Audience Matches were played back-to-back prior to the Head-to-Head round), forcing a modified front-game question to be played in place of that show's Head-to-Head match; the contestant won. Averted with later versions: The 2016 ABC primetime version instead gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">Consolation Prize</a> of $1,000 for the Head-to-Head round, which can be multiplied to $5,000; and when the show was married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a> in 1983-1984, the contestant was given $100 and could turn it into up to $3,000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NameThatTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NameThatTune">Name That Tune</a></em>: Most game shows' bonus rounds that were quiz-based allowed for incorrect answers; the game would still proceed and allow the contestant a chance to achieve the stated goal (guess 10 correct answers in 60 seconds to win). This game was one of the exceptions: With only seven songs to be guessed (in a 30-second time period), the contestant had to guess all seven songs correctly to win the day's top prize and be invited back to a grand prize tournament. This meant that even one wrong answer stops the game immediately and the player is left to take home <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">consolation prizes</a>. The standard game overs, then, come if the player guesses all seven songs or the time limit expires before all seven songs are guessed.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck">Press Your Luck</a></em>, the standard Game Over was whenever all three contestants had exhausted their spins, with victory going to the highest scoring player. A nonstandard game over could occur in one of two situations:
<ul><li> If the other two contestants had "Whammied out" (i.e., hit four Whammys, which takes them out of the game) and the remaining contestant still had spins, he or she could play "against the house" with the added option of stopping whenever he or she wanted, as opposed to using up all available spins.
</li><li> The alternative is if a contestant hits a Whammy on his or her last spin when his or her opponents have $0; unless one of the contestants has "Whammied out", then the game is declared a three-way tie and all three contestants return the next day.
</li><li> One episode of the sequel series, ended with one player winning with $0 and zero spins after both of her opponents whammied out. While she didn't win any money, she was allowed to return for another game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where she won again, this time earning actual money.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>: Several pricing games  those involving the pricing of groceries or small items  have this clause if the contestant is wrong with all questions or fails to meet any conditions on his/her given choices (usually three), and the contestant had to earn all picks. A few examples:
<ul><li> <strong>Bullseye</strong>: In this game involving pricing of groceries, the objective was to pick an item and tell how many was needed to  when multiplied by the price of the item  reach a target score of $10-12, which was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>. If the actual total wasn't within $10-12 <em>but</em> at least $2 and not more than $12, the contestant earned a mark on the board resembling an archery target, meaning they could still win if that item concealed a hidden bullseye; up to three turns were given. The trope kicks in, then, if the contestant fails to at least get one mark on the board  that is, he was below $2 or above $12 on every one of his three picks, meaning the hidden bullseye is out of play and cannot help; despite the instant early loss condition, the host often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened">will still show the audience which grocery item had the hidden bullseye</a>.
</li><li> <strong>5 Price Tags</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on all four true-false pricing questions. At least one correct answer was needed to be able to pick from one of the price tags they thought was the correct price.
</li><li> <strong>Master Key</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on both either-or pricing questions, meaning no pick of which one of the five keys. The contestant needed one or both correct answers to try to pick the right key and (attempt to) win at least something.
</li><li> <strong>Rat Race</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on all three pricing questions, meaning no selection of the rats (although the rodents may run anyway just for fun). At least one was needed for the contestant to have a stake in the race.
</li><li> <strong>Shell Game</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on all four higher-lower pricing questions, meaning no chips on the table; they had to have at least one correct to place a chip beside the shell they thought concealed the ball.
</li><li> <strong>Bonus Game</strong>: Like <strong>Shell Game</strong>, if the contestant is wrong on all four higher-lower pricing questions, meaning they won't have control over any windows, including the <strong>Bonus</strong> window; they had to have at least one correct to have a chance of controlling the <strong>Bonus</strong> window.
</li><li> <strong>Punch-A-Bunch</strong> (also known as the <strong>Punchboard</strong>): If the contestant is wrong on all four higher-lower pricing questions, meaning no punches to use on the board; at least one was needed to punch a hole and win something.
</li><li> <strong>Secret X</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on both small item prices, meaning no extra Xs to go with the first one they receive, at least 2 Xs are needed to be able to make a tic-tac-toe with the Secret X in the middle column.
</li><li> <strong>One Away</strong>: If the contestant is wrong on all five (previously four) numbers the first time; <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note105psf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note105psf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note105psf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This rule exists because if the contestant gets all five numbers wrong, then it would become clear that the 5 numbers the contestant didn't flip to were the correct ones, meaning changing to the other numbers would reveal the correct price. This scenario only happened once, in 1989, with the audience and Bob jeering the contestant for it </span> one correct number was necessary to attempt a second try. A nonstandard win occurs if the contestant gets all five numbers <em>right</em> on the first try.
</li><li> Originally the case with <strong>Pass The Buck</strong> on its first three or four playings, where three pairs of grocery items were used and no free pick was given, meaning a Non-Standard Game Over for the contestant if they were wrong on all three pairs, since it would result in no picks on the board. This was changed afterward to give the contestant a free pick, as well as reduce the pairs from three to two and the board spaces from eight to six (losing $2,000 and leaving two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy">Lose Everythings</a> instead of three.)
</li><li> Retired Games:
<ul><li> <strong>Hit Me</strong>: A la Blackjack, if the contestant picked grocery items with cards that brought their score to 22 or higher, meaning THEY bust and forfeit the game regardless of the house's score.
</li><li> <strong>Joker</strong>: If the contestant was wrong on all four small prizes, meaning they can't discard any cards, including the target Joker; at least one was needed for the contestant to have a chance of discarding the Joker, which was the goal of the game.
</li><li> <strong>Phone Home Game</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">If the home viewer on the phone accidentally read the product names instead of the prices on all three grocery items that they were allowed to play for, because the goal of the game was for the stage contestant to guess what product held the price that the home viewer selected.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">This would mean they forfeited the game, and it happened at least once.</a>
</li><li> <strong>Super Ball!</strong> If the contestant was wrong on all four balls (the last of which was the Super Ball), meaning they had no balls to play the skee ball game with; at least one was needed to play and win.
</li><li> <strong>Telephone Game</strong><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11lp1v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11lp1v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11lp1v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A rare game that was only played a few times, and had the misfortune of mostly appearing on episodes with fur coat prizes; these episodes were excluded from being rerun when then-host Bob Barker became a vegetarian and began his pet population campaign </span>: A one time form of the trope; if the contestant spent more that 90 cents of the dollar they were provided in the pricing round of this game, meaning they didn't have enough money to make a call in the second round; at least 10 cents (a dime) was required to make a phone call in the second round for the contestant to win.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the front game, after the first four categories are played, the fifth category is selected by the team that is trailing. If, after that fifth category, the team's score is still behind that of their opponents, the game is automatically ended (unless the remaining box is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace">7/11 or Mystery 7</a>, thus allowing for at least a chance at it). More than once, because the trailing team was behind by more than eight points (categories only have seven words, meaning a maximum of seven points possible per round), the game was ended after the fourth category. The standard game over, then, comes with the sixth category (either the winning team scores enough points to win, or if the trailing team is still behind when time expires). Theoretically, the earliest a Pyramid front game could end is during the playing of the first word of the fourth category; that is, the losing team is trailing 14-0 and they immediately get disqualified on the first word. Not enough words would be available to help the trailing team at least tie.
</li><li> This could also happen in the Winner's Circle. If all six subjects are guessed in 60 seconds or less, the contestant wins the large bonus. Giving an illegal clue on a category puts it out of play and the contestant forfeits the chance at the jackpot. However, if any categories are left, play continues until the rest are guessed or time runs out. If the former happens, the Winner's Circle just ends with no music and no flashing board indicating a bonus round win. You just see the lights come back on and the host explaining what went wrong. In this case, the standard game over is either getting all six in 60 seconds or time running out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Password Plus and Super Password</em> have an end game example similar to the above. The bonus round consists of ten passwords which must be communicated in order to win a large bonus. The standard game over is guessing all ten in 60 seconds or time running out. An illegal clue or accidentally reading a password or part of a password would put the password out of play and end the chance for the contestant to win the large bonus. If any passwords are left, the end game continues until the remaining are guessed or time runs out. In the case of the former, the round ends early with no celebration.
</li><li> For <em>Super Password's</em> <strong>Cashword</strong>, giving an illegal clue ended the segment in a loss right away, regardless of how many chances the contestants have left (up to 3). This happened at least twice.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenKeys">Seven Keys</a></em>, an early 1960s game show which married Q&amp;A to a Snakes and Ladders-esque game. The objective was to reach the end of a 70-space gameboard within an allotted number of turns (almost always 15) to win a key that the contestant hoped would unlock a large prize package (any given key could also unlock one of six other windows, showing smaller prizes worth up to $1,000); repeating the process seven times (ergo, winning "seven keys") won the main prize automatically. Anyway, contestants were limited to moving 10 spaces forward on any one turn, and if the contestant could not reach the finish line on his final turn (ergo, had more than 10 spaces to move before reaching the finish), the game automatically ended. A loss also served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy">Whammy</a>, as the contestant lost all accumulated keys and a chance at the large bonus prize.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SupermarketSweep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SupermarketSweep">Supermarket Sweep</a></em> has a scavenger hunt end game with a $5,000 prize for finding three products. Prior to 1992, if the winning team grabbed the last item or the $5,000 before finding the other product(s), the round immediately ended in failure. Afterward, this changed to an overhead announcement reminding the team to go in order.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Trashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Trashed">Trashed</a></em> featured a <em>Pyramid</em>-esque bonus round in which each of the two contestants had to guess the artists in three separate music videos via clues given by his or her teammate. Giving an illegal clue (such as a part of the artist or band's name, the title of the song, etc.) eliminated that video from play and forfeited the chance to win the grand prize.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodNewsWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodNewsWeek">Good News Week</a></em>: Several episodes of the Australian current-affairs comedy have ended with both teams losing to the studio audience. On one particularly memorable occasion during the show's original 90's run, the show was won by host/scorer/umpire Paul McDermott.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeakestLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeakestLink">The Weakest Link</a></em> has been known to do this a few times; while there is no unusual way to lose the game other than being voted off or losing the final round, contestants occasionally show such a lack of intelligence that Anne sends them off without even saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"You are the Weakest Link, goodbye!"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo">Lingo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series had this happen twice in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> during Season 1. At the time, the round consisted of guessing a string of five-letter words in two minutes with the first letter and another random letter revealed, with a ball awarded for each correct word. After time expired, the team was given a Bingo board with 13 of the 25 spots already covered in such a way that a 5-in-a-row could be achieved in as few as two draws, and the grand prize was won for completing said 5-in-a-row "Lingo" at any time; a standard game over was either winning the prize package, or running out of balls and receiving a consolation prize. However, one team in Season 1 won only one ball (which was drawn anyway even though it was useless) and another somehow failed to guess <em>any</em> words in the two minutes, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12h103');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12h103" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12h103');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It doesn't help that their last word was "Kazoo" with the K &amp; A showing; first, they misspelled "Khaki" as "Kahki", and followed that with Chuck's favorite, "Kazaa". Since these spellings resulted in fake words, no further help regarding the letters was provided, and they ran out of time on the third chance.</span> thus winning <em>zero</em> balls and <em>zero</em> dollars; the Bonus Lingo board didn't even appear, and they left with the same consolation prizes that the losing team won in the main game.
</li><li> Another example came after the tweaking began in Season 2. From that point onward, the teams were now given a few "bonus letters" that they could add to the words at any time if they got stuck; also, the board had only 12 spots covered, but a Lingo could now be made in only one draw, with a larger prize (either a trip or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveJackpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveJackpot">Progressive Jackpot</a>) for completing the Lingo in only one draw, and a smaller prize for doing it in two or more draws. A standard game over was still the consolation prize for failing to complete a Lingo before all the earned balls were used up. The <em>non</em>-standard came when a team who won 7 balls failed to make a Lingo in all 7 draws; host Chuck Woolery, incredulous over what just happened, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustSeeWhatWouldHaveHappened">reached into the hopper himself</a> to draw another ball and, against 99.9% odds, drew the only number that <em>still</em> didn't make a Lingo.
</li><li> In both scenarios, there's a non-standard <strong>win</strong> condition, which is in play if a team is able to win 10 balls; this is the max amount of pulls allowed and the spelling game ends immediately if it happens. While this allegedly guarantees $1,000, it actually guarantees the $5,000 standard bonus prize because the team will have enough picks to eventually get a Lingo regardless of what order the balls are drawn (9 balls guarantees a Lingo in the bonus round from Season 2 onward).
</li></ul></li><li> The scandal-era edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOne">21</a></em> invoked a permutation of this. The objective was to reach 21 points to win, but after each contestant has had two questions, the game is over if the contestant in the lead (he/she has to assume this as the scores of the opponents are not disclosed when both booths are opened) chooses to end the game can. If this occurs either way, the player in the leads wins.

<ul><li> The penalty shootout occurs in many sports games, where the players or teams are tied after a certain amount of regulation play, getting alternate turns shooting or trying to score from a set situation and the team who scores the most wins.
<ul><li> The most widely known example is in Association Football, where teams get a number of shots from the penalty spot with the team who score the most winning. 5 kicks is the standard practice. If tied they keep going until one team misses while the other scores. Field Hockey shares the same style of shootout.
</li><li> Ice Hockey has a form where one player takes the puck from the halfway line, skates towards the goal and has to try and score in a one-one one with the goalkeeper. The North American Soccer League introduced a variation of penalty kicks that took inspiration from Ice Hockey, where the player would start 25 yards away from the goal and have to dribble towards the penalty box and shoot past the keeper. The majority of these attempts failed due to the strict time 5 second shot clock which stopped players from getting anywhere past the start of the penalty box and thus a long way from goal.
</li></ul></li><li> At the high school level and below — and in some cases, the collegiate level and some non-major league level sports leagues — there is a "mercy rule," which serves to either end a game after a prescribed point in the game or kick into effect a rule that hastens the end of the game once the winning team's margin reaches a defined point. This is as opposed to playing out a one-sided game to its natural conclusion under normal rules. Common applications:
<ul><li> <strong>Baseball</strong> and <strong>softball</strong>:
<ul><li> Virtually all state high school associations have rules which end games after a prescribed lead after a certain number of innings have been played. In both sports, the rule is usually 10 runs after five innings; it differs by sport if the winning team builds a larger lead even earlier; for instance, in baseball, the common rule is 15 runs after four innings, while in softball teams need only to have a 12-run lead after three innings. College contests have variations of this rule, but since baseball games at this level sometimes go the full nine innings, the 10-run rule doesn't usually kick in until the seventh inning. Softball rules are typically similar to high school's "10 after five" rule.
</li><li> Child-based and junior high level baseball and softball, and some semi-professional leagues often have variations of the "mercy rule." For instance, a townball league for children may even have a rule where a team that builds a huge lead — say, 30-0 — after just one inning is no longer is allowed to bat, and the trailing team is given more than the standard three outs (usually six, or if they are the home team and haven't batted yet, nine) to give everyone at least one at-bat, with the game continuing only if in the game manager's judgement the losing team has sufficiently caught up.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Football</strong>:
<ul><li> Most states have a "continuous clock" rule, which means that if a team has a certain lead after halftime (it varies from 35-50 points), the clock runs continuously, not stopping on plays where the clock normally would be stopped, such as an incomplete pass or a play going out of bounds (although the clock does stop for quarter breaks, time outs, and any scoring). The clock continues to run in these games until the scoring difference falls below the prescribed margin (normal timing rules once again take effect), but then kick back in if the winning team once again exceeds the margin.
</li><li> Prior to the advent of "continuous clock" rules, some states had rules whereby the game would end at halftime or any time after if the winning team has a certain lead (usually, 50 points or more). In Kansas, an eight-man football game (or six-man game in Texas) stops once a team gets a lead of at least 45 points by halftime or at any point after that (The entire first half must be played out). This rule came into effect during the 1980s, when some games featured mismatches so great, the winning team was easily scoring 90 or, on some rare occasions, 100 points.
</li><li> In the NFL, most overtime games end with a field goal or touchdown, but on three occasions, they have ended in a safety (a defensive play where the defense stops the offense inside their own end zone).
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Basketball</strong>: Much like football, state high school athletic associations have implemented "continuous clock" timing rules if the winning team is ahead by a certain margin (usually 30 points) after halftime. There are currently no known states that end a game before the end of the fourth quarter if an even higher point difference is reached.
</li><li> <strong>Soccer</strong>:
<ul><li> Many states have rules where a team would automatically be declared the winner and the game ended if ahead by a certain number of goals at halftime or any time after. Usually, this difference is 10 goals. Additionally, a few states have provisions limiting the number of red cards a team can receive during the season before being disqualified from post-season competition. In a game situation, the trope kicks into effect if the disqualifying red card is given to a team, automatically  upon verification that indeed the "red card" limit has been surpassed  ending the game and awarding the game to the other team by default.
</li><li> In Canada, the Gloucester Dragons league briefly had a <em>reverse</em> mercy rule, in which a blowout by more than five goals counted as a <em>loss</em> for the winning team. This got such <a class="urllink" href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/01/win-a-soccer-game-by-more-than-five-points-and-you-lose-ottawa-league-says/">bad press<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the league reversed course within <a class="urllink" href="http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/sports/story.html?id=d39fef4e-6ffc-4c15-b2de-313001f987e8">two weeks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, adopting a standard eight-goal mercy rule. The reverse rule had actually been directed at coaches, some of whom had been letting their teams run roughshod over weaker ones, but it sent a pretty dubious message to everyone else — not to mention the obvious potential for abuse (score six own goals to win!).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The NCAA (particularly in football and basketball) and professional leagues such as the NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball <em>do not</em> have mercy rules, meaning they could score an unlimited number of points, runs, etc., without having special rules kick into effect to hasten the end of the game. Meaning unfortunate teams on the losing end would have no choice but to continue playing and trying to reduce the margin. (Which is not very fun for the loser.) That said, a continuous clock was used on at least three occasions in NCAA Division I football games, where the winning team ran up a large lead by halftime and agreed to a continuous clock for the entire second half; the winning team in all cases at least maintained the lead, with two of them increasing the lead. Aside from that, teams that have a very large lead over their opponents, especially a decidedly weaker one, will typically play reserves, run plays designed to take time off the clock (such as in football, run the ball up the middle and rarely if ever pass), use pinch hitters (in baseball, said roles going to non-starters and/or reserves) with low batting averages, or shoot the ball conservatively (in basketball).
</li><li> <strong>Boxing</strong>: At all levels, a boxer can be knocked down only so many times before he will be declared the loser by TKO — that is, a "technical knockout." It is also an automatic "game over" — that is, match over — if one boxer fails to answer a 10 count (that is, sufficiently get up in the referee's judgement) to continue the match. At some levels (though rarely at high-level bouts, since it rarely happens), the match automatically ends if a boxer is knocked down three times in a round.
</li><li> In the "8-Ball" variant of pocket billards, you win if you legally sink the 8-ball (no other balls of your pattern remaining, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">calling the pocket you're going to sink the 8-ball in</a> and then legally sinking the 8-ball there) before your opponent does. However, it is possible to <em>lose on your turn</em> instead, in the following ways:
<ul><li> Sinking the 8-ball when you haven't sunk every ball of your pattern yet.
</li><li> When you <em>are</em> allowed to sink the 8-ball:
<ul><li> Sinking the 8-ball in a pocket you did not call.
</li><li> Sinking the 8-ball in the correct pocket, but making a foul in the process (e.g. a scratch, hitting an opponent's ball first).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13da44');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13da44" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13da44');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that if you foul up, but <em>don't</em> sink the 8, the usual foul rules apply instead of an instant loss.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Knocking the 8-ball off the table</a>, although this is generally rare.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>, apart from the usual results of a win or draw over 90 minutes, or the 120 minutes of extra time, there are a handful of other ways to win or lose a game.
<ul><li> In a two match tie (used in knock-out competitions), the <em>away goals rule</em>, if the aggregate score is tied, then whoever scored the most goals in their match away from home wins.
</li><li> Most leagues have a statue in the laws that says when a team cannot field a certain number of players, (most often a team being down to 6 from a team of 11), the game is abandoned, although depending on the score or the laws of the league the game can still be awarded to the team with enough players. One example of this was titled the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bramall_Lane">Battle Of Bramall Lane<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where Sheffield United had their goalkeeper sent off in the 9th minute, followed by two players who had been substituted onto the pitch being involved in a scuffle with the opposition that resulted in both being sent off only minutes after coming on. This left them with 8 players. They went down to 7 players when one was injured in the 79th minute minutes right after their opposition took a 3-0 lead, followed by another player going off hurt in the 83rd. Reduced to 6 players, the referee abandoned the match, which was subsequently awarded to West Bromwich Albion.
</li></ul></li><li> Numerous sports have what is termed "Sudden Death", "Golden Goal" or "Golden Point" where after a draw, the game continues to be played in extra time, with the first team to score a point of any kind is immediately the winner. It was introduced for Association Football in 1993 but removed by 2004.
</li><li> A bizarre variation of the Golden Goal rule as part of the 1994 Caribbean Cup Qualification football tournament was that any goal scored in Golden Goal extra time counted as double for the league ladder in addition to winning the match itself. The final match for Barbados required them to defeat Grenada by 2 goals to qualify in first place and go through to the tournament itself. Barbados were winning the match 2-1, but were unable to score a goal to make the game 3-1. They decided to score an own goal which would tie the match and send it to extra time, hopefully allowing them to score a golden goal, worth double, to finish first. With only a handful of minutes left, the Grenada players cottoned onto the plan, and realised that they would finish first if they could score a goal at <em>either end of the field</em>. This resulted in Barbados defending both ends of the field and they succeeded in bringing the game to extra time and then scored a winning golden goal, winning the match 4-2 (despite only scoring 3 goals), and then qualifying in first place.
</li><li> Another development across word sports was the "Silver Goal" (although other sports use different terminology). It is a variation of Golden Goal where the instant win condition of scoring any point in extra time is removed to allow the opposition team a certain amount of time or plays to equal or better the opposition. In Association Football this Silver Goal period was one half of extra time. When used in American Football, the team who have been scored on get one drive to match or better their opposition result, which can lead to a team scoring a field goal, then losing because their opposition scored a touchdown.
</li><li> In <strong>Sumo Wrestling</strong>, if a wrestler's loin cloth falls off, they lose instantly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">For obvious reasons</a>, this infraction is extremely rare.
</li><li> <strong>Cricket</strong> test matches has 3 standard endings after the 5 days of play, with 2 innings per team, comes to a close: A team may either win, lose, or draw<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note143832');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note143832" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note143832');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">aka. No result was reached at the end of the match</span> the match. The non-standard ending is the tie, where the scores are exactly level once the team batting fourth and last has lost all of their batsmen. This has only happened twice in more than 2100 test matches. Should not be confused with the scores being level as the allotted time runs out, in which case it's a "We flippin' murdered 'em"-draw.

<ul><li> Chess: Resigning before you're put into checkmate. Often symbolized by deliberately knocking over your own king's piece, though this is not required. Both players may also choose to agree to a draw if they realize that neither of them can reasonably checkmate the other. Draws can also occur under the threefold repetition rule in which both players end up in the same position three times.
</li><li> <em>Any</em> tabletop RPG set in more modern times can have a non-standard game over in probably the most mundane way possible: Your character gets arrested. This is more likely in settings where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a> are just normal humans, and can be especially prominent when they are fighting any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that looks (or turns back into a) human after its dead. You may have been fighting to save the world, but to the police a corpse is a corpse after all, and while your character might get out on bail, or have their case thrown out due to lack of evidence, for all practical purposes you are out of the game for at least a little while until your bail hearing, the case has been to court etc. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Hunter: The Vigil</a></em> specifically mentions this as a danger hunters of any level face, and games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em> which feature the players fighting wholly mortal servants of some monster often at least imply this.
</li><li> Seeing as it is based on comic books, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a> features a few ways to cause the players to get a Non-Standard Game Over (the standard way of winning is to reduce the Villain to 0 HP)
<ul><li> If Baron Blade has 15 or more cards in his trash (i.e. discard pile) at the start of his turn, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam">Tractor Beam</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">plunges the moon into the Earth</a>, and everyone dies.
</li><li> Evil Alien Overlord Grand Warlord Voss takes over the Earth if he has 10 or more Minions in play at the start of his turn.
</li><li> The Dreamer turns the Standard win condition listed above into the lose condition in battles against her: If she dies, the heroes lose. Justified, for two reasons: 1) The Dreamer is the child version of the hero Visionary, who time traveled to the present to save her younger self from a government project, so if Dreamer dies, Visionary dies. 2) the Dreamer's psychic powers overloaded during a nightmare and the nightmares themselves but be destroyed to wake her up. In short, the battle is one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation">Hostage Situation</a>.

</li><li> The environments also have Non-Standard Game Overs occasionally. The most prominent is the Self Destruct Sequence in the Wager Mars Base. If the Sequence completes itself, the base blows up and everyone dies.
</li><li> Silver Gulch, 1993, has Lost In the Past. If there are no cards in the Environment's trash by the end of it's turn, the time portal the heroes used to get to Silver Gulch closes and thus, the heroes lose.
</li><li> The Mobile Defense Platform has the Propulsion Systems. If it loses all of it's 10 HP, the Platform blows up and everyone dies. Note that it can be removed or destroyed in other ways without invoking the everyone dying part.
</li></ul></li><li> As of the last couple of editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, if a game turn ends with one player having no models at all on the board, they are "tabled" and immediately lose. Doesn't matter if they have enough Victory Points in the bag to wipe the floor with their opponent, or if they have their entire army in reserve ready to drop in at the start of the next turn — if you get tabled, you lose everything. <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/gallery/V0gND">Read the story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a powergamer who lost by having his enemy deploy their models on <em>his</em> side of the board, thus preventing him to deploy his own model, and thus lost the game before it even started.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fluxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fluxx">Fluxx</a></em> has Goal cards — if someone meets the conditions on an active Goal card, they win.
