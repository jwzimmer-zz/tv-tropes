</p><p>For example, sending a fleet to fight a practice battle just off the coast of a country that's not giving you what you want is a classic example of gunboat diplomacy. The idea is to remind the target that you're stronger than they are, so if they don't do what you want you can always destroy their stuff and kill their people.
</p><p>If the power playing the Gunboat Diplomacy trope is (a great deal) stronger than their opponent, this trope is win-win for them - if the target attacks the military force you used to threaten them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">then you're perfectly justified in using force against them</a>. If they give in to your demands, no one dies and you get what you wanted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">And if they don't give in, but don't actually attack you, either?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">You can always make it look like they tried</a>.

Even in those cases, though, there's usually a thinly-veiled message being sent to <em>someone</em> that messing around in ways the dispatching nation doesn't approve of is going to mean trouble.
</p><p>Still pretty common today, even though the Cold War is over — chiefly involving the USA's dozen aircraft carrier battle fleets or tens of thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets">Russians with Rusting Rockets</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionMookMarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionMookMarch">a large number of soldiers marching in formation</a> by many countries (the largest ones routinely held by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport">China</a>, Russia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndiansWithIglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndiansWithIglas">India</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKoreansWithNodongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKoreansWithNodongs">North Korea</a>).

<ul><li> In just the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> Hacker finds himself faced with a tricky situation involving the new dictator of an African state who, for various reasons, they need something from, but who is threatening to cause an embarrassing incident. The foreign secretary muses jokingly that in the old days they would just send in a gunboat. Hacker then asks if that is, absolutely, out of the question, to shocked stares.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1h6c0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1h6c0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1h6c0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The problem is solved when the Brits realize that the dictator is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy">one of Hacker's old friends from uni</a>, who has changed his name and converted to Islam as a political move; they settle the whole thing over a nice cup of tea.</span>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesPrimeMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesPrimeMinister">Yes, Prime Minister</a></em>, Hacker (now PM), arranges for a full battalion of paratroopers to pay a goodwill visit to a small third-world country that may just be about to suffer from a Communist uprising, against Sir Humphrey's wishes.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Hacker</strong>: And the Americans say they have an entire airborne division standing by in case we need reinforcements. <br/><strong>Sir Humphrey</strong>: Of what?! <br/><strong>Hacker</strong>: Reinforcements of <em>goodwill</em>, Humphrey!
</div></li><li> Happens quite often in the various versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>. Captain Kirk does it well because he is such a Badass.
<ul><li> Federation Diplomacy seems to consist of sending two diplomats to discuss things in a patronising manner, then holding the talks on a massively over-armed starship in orbit above one of the party's homeworld.
</li><li> This is Lampshaded in the original script for "A Taste of Armageddon". Scotty protests "I haven't served 30 years in the engine room of a Starship to be accused of gunboat diplomacy!" In the episode, he actually says, "The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank!" One of the reasons why it happens so often is that the first contact goes violent often enough that you have to back it up with firepower simply to be safe — and as warp travel is generally too slow to get reinforcements there in reasonable time, that means the ships <em>making</em> first contact has to have that firepower. The ships simultaneously display the benefits of Federation friendship (access to amazing technology) and the downsides of enmity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">very very big guns</a>). End result: the Federation keeps making initial agreements with newly discovered species while a starship capable of wiping out a civilization hangs around nearby.
</li><li> In the episode "A Taste of Armageddon", Kirk is taken hostage by the people of Eminar, and obtains his release by ordering the implementation of General Order 24 in two hours: destruction of any city, military structure, and evidence or hint that something on the target planet may have the ability to tickle the ships' shields, and Eminar's anti-orbit weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">had precisely that effect</a>. He then ends the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between the people of Eminar and the neighbouring Vendikar by destroying the computers that calculate what effect the attacks would have on the enemy and order people to disintegration chambers (that's why they try to destroy the <em>Enterprise</em>: the computers had calculated the <em>Enterprise</em> would have been destroyed as collateral damage), thus forcing both sides to engage in peace talks rather than restart actual war.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, Janeway is not afraid to more or less punch her way through the Delta Quadrant, but she usually tries talking first. In the episode "Juggernaut", for example, B'Elanna complains about having to work with the Malon, who dump toxic waste in open space, and that Janeway's solution is always diplomacy. Earlier in the episode? Janeway telling the Malon they could help her fix their doomed ship or she would beam them back onto their escape pod, which was inside the blast radius. In Janeway's defense, she's operating several light-<em>millennia</em> outside Starfleet's jurisdiction, so it's understandable why she'd want to maintain a strong and intimidating hand in every alien encounter. As depicted in the below incident where Voyager encounters the Lokirrim, who don't like holograms (they're facing an AI hologram rebellion).
<div class="indent"><strong>Janeway:</strong> Your sensors should confirm [our holodecks have] been deactivated.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lokirrim Captain:</strong> You're still required to submit to inspection.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Janeway:</strong> Your sensors should also confirm that our weapons are ready to fire. We're both reasonable people. I suggest a compromise. Your vessel will escort us through Lokirrim territory. That way, you can keep an eye on us, make sure we don't reactivate our holodecks. The other alternative is, we destroy your ship.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lokirrim Captain (suddenly looking a bit uncomfortable):</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">Your proposal is acceptable.</a> <em>[Transmission ends]</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Janeway (sits back down in her chair):</strong> Sometimes diplomacy requires a little sabre rattling. <em>[Chakotay smirks]</em> Begin long-range scans.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>, this trope gets worked a few different ways in the series pilot. T'Kuvma, a Klingon leader attempting to rally the Empire against the Federation, argues that the Federation uses their peaceful exploration gimmick as a means to subvert and assimilate other races without having to fight them. Sarek notes that the Vulcans had previously gained the Klingons' respect by demonstrating that they were willing to engage them in battle, and when faced with a Klingon fleet gathering on the edge of Federation space, Starfleet rallies their own fleet of ships to face off with them before offering to talk things out peacefully (the Klingons don't trust the Federation's intentions, and a large space battle and an interstellar war promptly ensues).
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a>, a real estate agent refuses to do business with Tony, so he has some of his men park a boat next to the agent's beach house and play loud music.
</li><li> A fairly common tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:

The <em>XMC</em> class or <em>Glorious Heritage</em>-class heavy cruisers like the <em>Andromeda Ascendant</em> were built for exactly this purpose. They were the diplomatic flagships of the Commonwealth that usually operated without a task force for extended periods of time.

They may accept or refuse, depending on how powerful you are compared to them, whether you've made other demands recently, or whether or not you're simply asking too much. In <em>Civ V</em>, this is further expanded on with minor civs called City-States, from whom you can explicitly demand tribute in the form of gold or Worker units if you have a strong enough military near them. Doing so will anger the City-State and may also annoy major civs who are trying to curry favor with the City-State for the benefits it offers. There's even a late-game bonus called "Gunboat Diplomacy" which rapidly increases your influence with any city-state you have the ability to demand tribute from — this ability is available to those who pursue the Autocracy ideology.

<ul><li> At the height of its power in the 1800s, the British Empire became famous for this. It was said that the empire could quiet the whole of China by simply dispatching a single warship<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mdls');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mdls" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mdls');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Untrue, as the French found out in their 1884-85 Sino-French (mini-)War. France tried to take on China alone, and despite sinking half the antiquated Qing fleet was effectively fought to a standstill by modernised Qing Empire ground forces. The war reminded all the interested parties - France, Britain, Russia, Japan - that they needed each other's cooperation if they wanted to extract any more 'special concessions' (trade outposts, military bases) from The Empire Of The Qing - which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">despite supposedly being on its last legs</a>, was regarded with renewed caution (until the much larger Sino-Japanese War of 1895, which revealed that the Qing's refusal to adopt a modern logistics/command system complete hamstrung their forces despite their size and usage of uber-modern weaponry)</span>. Boastful hyperbole, to be sure, but hyperbole with a point. It was taken to ridiculous levels with the Don Pacifico affair when Britain's reaction to a British citizen in Greece being mugged was to send the Royal Navy over to blockade the entire country until the Greeks caught the man responsible and paid Don Pacifico compensation (although it should be noted that Pacifico was Jewish, and he was only the latest in a long line of British Jews to be abused in Greece, so the British did have, if you squint, a slightly nobler motive).
<ul><li> During the Second Opium War, the British and French sent what amounted to little more than three divisions (not even 60,000 troops) to escort their ambassadors to Peking - ostensibly in the hope that they would be recognised as equals rather than being made to do the kowtow and be officially recognised as vassals/servants. The Qing court umm-ed and ah-ed and eventually met them with armed force when they kept marching on the capital. However, their decently-armed but disorganised and ill-led force of 200,000 (which had zero experience of modern warfare to boot) was quickly routed and the Imperial Court fled the city still refusing to negotiate. The Allies stuck around and pillaged the place until they did.
<ul><li> Cleverly exploiting this was the way Russia peacefully and amicably acquired her Maritime Provinces in 1860. By negotiating a settlement and treaty to stop Allied troops from ransacking Beijing further, the Russian Ambassador established a certain rapport with the Emperor was able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">convince him</a> that the sparsely-inhabited (Han Chinese were prohibited to settle there by the Manchu Qing dynasty, whose semi-nomadic people were the only people living there) lands in question were not only economically useless but also impossible to protect. He actually had a point there, as just seven years later Russia sold her lands in North America (the USA's current state of 'Alaska') to the USA for the exact same reasons. From that point onward, Russian diplomats were always keen to point out that Russia's acquisitions of Qing territory had been by mutual agreement and not made under duress - criticising at great length the French and the Japanese for their own less subtle approaches.
</li></ul></li><li> The governor of Guangzhou tried this against The British East India Company, without appreciating the close ties between The Company and the British government or the extent to which two hundred years of nothing more than border-skirmishes with steppe tribes and mountain-kingdoms had left Qing Chinese forces woefully inexperienced and ill-equipped for waging a full-scale modern war of the kind Europe had been fighting for four hundred years very nearly non-stop by that point (chiefly the Hundred Years' War, Eighty Years' War, Thirty Years' War, Seven Years' War, War of American Independence, War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession, French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars).
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">Gunboat War</a>" between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom from 1807 to 1814. Because the Royal Navy had forced Denmark to hand over its battle-fleet through the 1807 bombardment of Copenhagen (i. e. a direct attack on the civilian population of the Danish capital), Denmark could only continue the unequal struggle with its smaller naval ships, i. e. gunboats.
</li><li> The USA's Central-South American Banana Republics were, as per the page image, kept in line by constant reminders of the threat of force and the occasional USA-organised/supported coup d'etat. From a little after the US Civil War up until relatively recently, this trope has been in force to some extent.
<ul><li> The page image also refers to a policy of gunboat diplomacy by proxy. The United States didn't want European warships intruding into the American sphere of influence; instead, the Europeans would ask the US to send a gunboat to apply pressure on their behalf.
<ul><li> Specifically, the page image is referring to the Monroe Doctrine - that the USA would resist all European attempts to interfere in 'their' zone of influence, i.e. the whole of the Americas. No-one took it seriously at the time, as the US was a third-rate power and it was clear that places like British Canada and Spanish Cuba were not part of the Americas, by this definition. Nor were places like Argentina, which was <em>Britain's</em> model Banana Republic. Anyhow, note how Roosevelt is aiming the gun at the monarchical European figure while the poor, defenseless Latin American cowers beneath him. The image doesn't actually show gunboat diplomacy as such but instead presents a benign ideal of it, as one would expect of a (biased) US political cartoon.
</li><li> Incidentally, they started taking it seriously during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">Spanish-American War</a>, when an American fleet in the Caribbean wiped out an entire Spanish fleet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">In an afternoon.</a> While suffering one casualty. From heatstroke. (American demands afterwards rapidly jumped from "get out of Cuba" to "give us all of your islands", especially when a second Spanish fleet in the Philippines fared little better.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em>SMS Panther</em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>, when it was dispatched by the German Empire to Morocco in 1911, during the Agadir Crisis. This incident popularised the phrase "gunboat diplomacy" and also contributed to the First World War.
<ul><li> The "Panther's Leap" also counts as a subversion of sorts, since the entire affair was a complete farce. She was ostensibly dispatched to Agadir to protect German citizens in the port, but this plan had one glaring flaw: there were no German citizens in Agadir. Realising this, the German government sent a telegram to the only German citizen in the area - a perfectly happy, unendangered man called Wilburg - and ordered him to travel 75 miles south to Agadir to be "rescued". The <em>Panther</em> arrived on July 1st, 1911, only to discover that Wilburg hadn't arrived, so the gunboat sat impotently in the bay waiting for him. When he finally did reach Agadir, he was so exhausted from his journey that his only priority was finding a hotel for the night. The next morning he awoke to discover that the <em>Panther</em> had been joined by a second German gunboat, the <em>Berlin</em>. Deciding it was time to go and get himself rescued, Wilburg made his way down to the beach and waved at the ships... who promptly ignored him. Frustrated, Wilburg began to jump up and down and throw a tantrum on the beach - only for the officers of the <em>Berlin</em> to assume he was a deranged native. It was only when Wilburg stood with his hands on his hips and glared at them in silent fury that it dawned on them that this might be the man they were supposed to rescue - because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">no native would ever stand with his hands on his hips.</a> Wilburg was duly saved from the terrifying prospect of a nice day on the beach. In truth, the entire episode had been intended to warn the French of trying to obstruct German colonization in Africa but backfired spectacularly when it drew the ire not just of the French, but the British as well.
</li><li> Worse yet, the incident demonstrated Austria-Hungary's complete unwillingness to back Germany up when push came to shove. Rather than seeking a new ally - i.e. Russia, a rising power with close economic ties to Germany - they tried even harder to enlist Austro-Hungarian support. Ultimately, German support for Austria-Hungary and fear of Russia's growing economic and military power impelled Germany to escalate a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">into a pan-European conflict involving France and Germany as well</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3m53y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3m53y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3m53y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> under the fatalistic logic that war was inevitable (largely because of French desire to retake Alsace-Lorraine) and the odds would only get worse as time went by and Russia became even more powerful - Russia had already matched Germany in artillery by 1914, to say nothing of the size of her trained reserve of manpower as a country with more than twice the population of Austria-Hungary and Germany put together </span>. Neutral but virulently Germanophobic Britain using the invasion of Belgium as a pretext to attack Germany and Germany staging a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> to bring The Ottoman Empire into the war against Russia were just the icing on the cake.
<ul><li> At the start, only Churchill and Gray were in support of intervention, and both the leadership and citizenry the U.K. were unwilling to get involved in the war. It was the (vastly exaggerated) atrocities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4c48e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4c48e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4c48e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's no denying the Germans behaved badly in Belgium; but their actions were vastly exaggerated in terms of number and awfulness as a propaganda tool, including British newspapers adding a lot of completely invented ones just to make sure. Exaggeration of German atrocities in WW1 was so notorious that many people in WW2 refused to believe reports of Nazi atrocities - considering their own press and politicians were lying again.</span> which the German army committed in Belgium which finally propelled them to act. Those atrocities were themselves propelled by the Germans not being familiar with the nature of urban combat, where every shot echoed, causing a false belief that the troops were constantly under threat of ambush by native partisans. By the standards of the time, partisans were considered war criminals so those atrocities were considered "appropriate" by the occupying forces.
</li><li> <em>Publicly</em> in support of intervention. Declaring war on Germany was a fantastic opportunity to destroy another Great Power and make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheIrishQuestion">The Irish Question</a>, women's rights, and labour unrest go away for a bit. Britain had fully intended to make war on Germany in the event of <em>any</em> Franco-German war, including one started by France, for at least three years (i.e. since the second Moroccan crisis of 1911) by then. Claiming it was all done to champion the cause of some foreigners nobody <em>actually</em> cared about was great stuff for keeping the common people quiet, but it would be a grave mistake to assume this was an <em>actual</em> reason. Britain showed what it <em>really</em> thought about 'neutrality' and 'atrocities' with their wartime occupation of non-aligned Greece, their handling of assassinations and rebellion in Ireland ('Black and Tans', anyone?), and 'Amritsar Massacre' of 1919. Reginald Dyer, responsible for the lattermost, retired a national hero.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The two Moroccan Crises of 1905 and 1911. Both also illustrate the major problem with the gunboat approach; you have to have the biggest stick around to pull it off, or you'll be slapped down by those who <em>do</em>.
</li><li> <em>USS Texas</em> earned the nickname "The Old Statesman" (think about it) after being used (along with several other ships) to exert diplomatic pressure on the Mexican government during whats now called the "Tampico Incident." She was actually one of the last ships literally referred to as a gunboat during her career to be used in this capacity.
<ul><li> <em>USS Iowa</em> has the nickname "the Big Stick" after Teddy Roosevelt's "speak softly and carry a big stick" quote. fittingly the Iowa class were the last battleships used to be used as a tacit threat in a similar idea to this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> There is the similar modern concept of "flattop diplomacy", flat top being the slang term for aircraft carrier. There is a bit more to it though. In flattop diplomacy, a carrier is docked in a foreign port where there are diplomatic tensions. The threat that the carrier poses is minor compared to the threat of starting a war with the carrier's home nation.
</li><li> American exercises off Libya in the 1980s, especially the Gulf of Sidra incidents.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marine Corps</a> hymn doesn't mention the Shores of Tripoli because of anything they did in the <em>20th</em> century.
</li><li> The Barbary Coast states were known as pirates and slave takers until visited in turn by the Americans, the British, and the French at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These three each persuaded them to turn to more gentle ways of life by the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">exceedingly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">strong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls">persuasions</a>.

The crisis also demonstrated the potential for gunboat diplomacy to backfire. The crisis was precipitated by the Chinese military conducting missile tests less than 40 miles from ROC-controlled territory as well as a mobilization of Chinese troops in Fujian province (the province closest to Taiwan) and several live-fire exercises. The actions were intended to scare the Taiwanese populace into not re-electing then-President Lee Teng-hui, who was seen by China as being pro-independence - the crisis actually <em>boosted</em> Lee's popularity in the 1996 election and gave him an outright majority in the polls as opposed to a mere plurality. China has since learned its lesson and hasn't tried anything so radical in subsequent Taiwanese elections.
</li><li> Perhaps most famously, the diplomatic mission of Commodore Matthew C. Perry (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">not that one</a>) to the Empire of Japan. His "diplomacy" involving the demand that Japan open its ports to trade with the United States, or else his fleet would sail all the way to Edo (now known as Tokyo) and burn it to the ground.
<ul><li> Subverted by his Russian equivalent, Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin who managed to open Japan for Russia <strong>after</strong> a tsunami destroyed his fleet.
</li><li> This was only the most famous of several rounds of this trope with Japan; Britain, after an English businessman was murdered for refusing to dismount and pay his respects to a passing noble, sent a squadron to bombard the towns of Kagoshima and Shimonoseki. Part of why Commodore Perry's tactics worked was because a growing faction in the Shogunate were going "Guys, we have <em>got</em> to get some of that for ourselves!"
</li><li> The final Japanese surrender in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was signed on <em>USS Missouri</em>, a battleship. Perry's US flag was brought along for the occasion as MacArthur was a blood relative of Perry's.
</li></ul></li><li> Defied repeatedly to its own ultimate detriment by Joseon Korea, which had seen what "opening markets" had done to China and wanted little part of it. The American armed schooner General Sherman was sent to Pyongyang in 1866, ostensibly to open trade relations, only to be destroyed by fireships when the crew refused to accept "no" for an answer. Later the same year, an estimated 800 French soldiers aboard six warships attempted to seize the mouth of the Han River and coastal access to the capital, only to be forced back by winter and overwhelming opposition. Talk of a joint French-American punitive expedition went nowhere, but in 1871, the Americans tried again with over 600 marines and five warships, taking five fortifications along the Han River and managing to only strengthen the regent's opposition to modernization, including new proclamations against "appeasing foreigners." It wasn't until their rapidly-modernizing Japanese neighbours threatened to fire on the capital Hanseong (today Seoul) itself that the Hermit Kingdom was finally forced to open its markets to foreign trade, with Japan, America, and Russia at the forefront.
</li><li> In order to construct the Panama Canal, US President Theodore Roosevelt encouraged the Panamanians to revolt against their Colombian rulers, promising assistance from the US Navy. The rebellion was successful mainly because USS <em>Nashville</em> just happened to be in local waters, discouraging the Colombians from sending troops to quell the rebels.
</li><li> Used without end by both sides during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> with various degrees of success. There were many versions, from troop movements around the border, military exercises that were either intentionally leaked or outright covered by the media, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear weapons testing</a>... The "who blinks first" attitude shared by both sides nearly led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">End of the World as We Know It</a>, multiple times.
</li><li> Inverted, after a fashion, by the British government in the 1970s when the Argentine government first made threatening moves against the Falkland Islands. Two frigates were quickly dispatched to Britain's own territory, as opposed to dropping into a major Argentine port to say hello, and were backed up by a fast-attack submarine that would have come as quite a rude shock if the Argentines had decided to press on regardless. Instead, they wisely took the hint and the invasion plan was shelved. Sadly, Mrs Thatcher's Conservative government was rather less on the ball regarding Latin America than the outgoing Labour administration under Jim Callaghan, and ten years later Galtieri had another go...
<ul><li> Britain is also prone to doing this by sending something to the Falklands every time Argentina starts making noises about 'Las Malvinas'. Until recently, it was usually a submarine (which after what happened to the <em>Belgrano</em>, Argentina is more than a little twitchy about), though in 2012 after a few particular noises too many, the <em>Dauntless</em> a brand new Type 45 'Daring' class Destroyer (equivalent of the US <em>Arleigh Burke</em> class) was sent to the islands.
</li></ul></li><li> Hilarious version: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Every time</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia">Malaysia</a> decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">taunt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a> about its territorial borders, Malaysia does indeed send a warship, only for Indonesia to send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">several</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish">bigger warships</a> (sometimes with an extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Cool Plane</a>).
</li><li> An interesting dueling version: During the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, the US sent in the Enterprise battle group to threaten India to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomping</a> the Pakistanis, only for the Soviets (who were sympathetic to India) to do the same thing. To prevent this from becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">Pretext for War</a>, the Americans stood down.
</li><li> The order of the day between North and South Korea: if you don't like how things are going in the diplomatic table, you arrange a "joint military exercise (with live rounds!)" near your neighbor's land or naval border. Sometimes the "training bullets" fly outside the exercise zone, too.
<ul><li> The US and South Korea habitually do joint training exercises near the hot area. When, in 2013, North Korea started one of the worst rounds of saber-rattling yet, the US sent a missile destroyer and a couple of B2 heavy bombers to play, in a show designed to say "careful who you mess with".
<ul><li> Unfortunately, due to peculiarities of the North Korean society (these guys tend to <em>believe</em> their own propaganda), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">it sends exactly the wrong message</a>.
</li><li> One <em>successful</em> account of this would be <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_axe_murder_incident">Operation Paul Bunyan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The background of the story is that the South Koreans had a tree on their side that needed to be cut since its presence prevented them from keeping an eye on a North Korean facility across the border. When they sent a small squad of Americans and their own soldiers to trim the tree, several North Korean soldiers crossed to the South Korean side and told them that the tree had been planted by Kim Il Sung himself, and trimming it was forbidden. When the Americans refused to stop their work, the North Korean soldiers attacked them with axes, killing several of them. The United States responded with the above-mentioned <strong>Operation Paul Bunyan</strong>, involving a more...aggressive trimming of the tree consisting of American combat engineering regiments, South Korean special forces, American AA and tank battalions, Cobra attack helicopters, F-111 attack aircraft, <em>B-52 nuclear bombers with fighter escort,</em> and enough naval and army forces on standby to reduce everything within a 5-mile radius of the tree to ash if given the word. The North Koreans were understandably alarmed about the sudden show of force (one intelligence officer monitoring NK radio communications at the time said that the sheer amount of firepower "blew their [...] minds") and deployed some machine gun teams on their side, but they wisely stayed well clear of the American forces as they chopped the tree down.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Shows of force are not limited to one's adversaries. They can just as much be messages to one's allies: "I will support you in the face of this third country threatening you" is more credible if you have your own skin in the game, like your own soldiers and ships.

Placing US troops in Europe was at least partly to assuage these fears - it would be far more difficult for Washington to politically justify not getting involved in a Warsaw Pact invasion scenario if American blood had already been shed.
<ul><li> The Berlin Brigade, a US Army contingent that was stationed in West Berlin (the UK and France also had similar contingents), can be considered an example of the previous on a smaller scale. Unification of Berlin was a prized objective of East Germany and the Soviet Union for reasons political<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6pake');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6pake" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6pake');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Having a unified capital that went back to the German Empire would give East Germany more legitimacy to its claim of representing all of Germany and allowed communist propoganda to portray the Bonn-based West Germany as an illegitimate puppet (and by extension shame the Western powers supporting it)</span> and pratical<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7xty7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7xty7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7xty7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">West Berlin, being so far behind the Inner German Border and having special rules that effectively became legal loopholes for emigration (not to mention how heavily guarded the Iron Curtain was), was a popular destination for many East German defectors</span>, and it wasn't like the Soviets wouldn't consider trying to strongarm the West into giving up West Berlin (c.f., the 1947-48 Berlin Blockade, the tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961) - in a hypothetical Warsaw pact invasion West Berlin would almost certainly be a target. The force wasn't all that large - about 3,000 for the US - and in an actual shooting war they would not have lasted more than a few days to any serious push by Warsaw Pact troops because they would be outnumbered by a ridiculous margin and be immediately cut-off from supplies behind the Iron Curtain. The real point was to make US citizens die in the defence of West Berlin and West Germany so that the USA's isolationists would be unable to oppose the war, and make NATO think it was less likely that the USA would abandon them if war broke out.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Both China and America have been sending their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">magnificent naval fleets</a> to the South China Sea. The PRC, to defend the undersea resources they claim to be rightfully theirs (which is to say, <em>the entire sea</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8emf6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8emf6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8emf6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> International law puts a country's Exclusive Economic Zone up to 300 km out from their coastline. The South China Sea doesn't align with the PRC's Coastline at all, and the sheer size of it means that the only way they could legally claim it all (as they do; their "logic" is apparently along the lines of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">it has China in its name so it obviously belongs to China</a>") is by controlling every bit of land that borders it - which is where the not-PRC countries of Vietnam, Malaysia, and The Philippines come in with their pesky independence and legal rights.</span>); the USA, to curb the PRC's claim by protecting the interests of her South-East Asian allies, who under international law have legitimate and universally recognised (except by the PRC) claims to it.
<ul><li> China's own attempts at gunboat diplomacy seem to actually be backfiring against them. By antagonizing their neighbors, China has actually pushed these to have closer ties to the US. The Philippines is already a given considering that they're already a recognized "Major Non-NATO Ally". More ironic however is Vietnam, a communist country and America's former foe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> are now moving towards closer ties towards their old foe. If China fears being encircled by enemies supported by the west, they surely aren't doing a very good job preventing it.
</li></ul></li><li> Employed by the USSR in the so-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">First Socialist War</a> (China's punitive war against Vietnam concerning the latter's incursions into China-friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia">Cambodia</a>). In 1979, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport">PRC</a> wound up its limited offensive upon Vietnam, the Soviet Union - Vietnam's ideological and Realpolitik backers - conducted one of the largest military manoeuvres in its history. More than thirty divisions were airlifted to the Sino-Russian border in less than a week, and the Navy burned through three years of its fuel reserves in the course of a month. Two divisions were actually left in Mongolia after the exercises, as doing so was cheaper than bringing them back. As far as the Soviets were concerned, not to mention the Vietnamese, the Chinese had been scared into submission. The Peoples' Liberation Army's desire to avoid the appearance of caving in to Soviet pressure actually made them want to continue to prosecute the war beyond the (limited and from a military standpoint, <em>stupid</em>) objectives they had been set.
</li><li> This trope is best summed up by the old maxim (source unknown) "Diplomacy works best when it's backed by credible threat of force."
</li><li> Iran, under pressure of embargo over their nuclear development, had threatened to blockade the Strait of Hormuz. The US responded by deploying their biggest aircraft carrier to patrol the waters.
</li><li> Northrop Grumman - the owners of the shipyards where US aircraft carriers are built - actually sell T-shirts and posters with the image of USS <em>Enterprise</em> from the front and the legend: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">90,000 tons of diplomacy.</a>"
</li><li> In 1825, Charles X, king of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>, sent a gunboat to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti">Haiti</a> to ask, in return of a diplomatic recognition, for an indemnity of 150 millions of francs for the slaveowners and planters whose properties were lost, which was paid until 1938 and which helped to burden local development.
</li><li> The three "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars">Cod Wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" between the United Kingdom and Iceland can be seen as another modern example. Here the British were unsuccessful in their attempts to impose their policies on Iceland.
</li><li> Averted by the Charter of the United Nations, which bans States from threatening the use of force against the territorial integrity or the independence of another State.
