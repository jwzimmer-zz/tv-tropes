The Guile Hero is likely to be a politician or a businessman, and engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits">Battles of Wits</a>. If he has superpowers, then he's likely to think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a>.

Though some other heroes may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">be unhappy with being manipulated</a> by the Guile Hero, it is made clear to the reader that this character both has a heroic goal and is not (usually) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> into becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. When a Guile Hero suffers an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>, it falls under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf">Too Clever by Half</a> trope.
</p><p>The Guile Hero combines elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> without having to be all of these. A Guile Hero isn't necessarily The Chessmaster: the Guile Hero is simply a hero who uses wit, charm, and skill to mislead and set up the bad guys, whereas The Chessmaster is often devoted to grander schemes and more likely to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMotifs">Chess Motifs</a>. A Manipulative Bastard tends to be more personal and controlling in his manipulations. A Guile Hero need not be a master manipulator; "guile" can mean "shrewdness" instead of "deceit". As for The Trickster, a Guile Hero is just as likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">"Stop Having Fun" Guy</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">fun-loving and mischevious</a> trickster. The Chain of Deals is just as valid a tool for these characters as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a>, and a Guile Hero may very well be a grown-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolHustler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolHustler">High School Hustler</a>.

The Guile Hero is also frequently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, and if a Sixth Ranger is also a Guile Hero, then he tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor">Sixth Ranger Traitor</a>.

He manipulates both the villains and the protagonists to ensure the protagonists can defeat the villains, telling the protagonists only what he feels they need to know and sometimes only just enough to get them into trouble. He's a firm believer in the school of hard knocks, believing the best martial training is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor">real battle experience</a>. However, he's also a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">shinigami</a> captain, and therefore when he has to fight, he willingly becomes a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero">Action Hero</a>. Most of his machinations, aid, and fighting tactics occur in the form of scientific knowledge and invention, as he's actually primarily a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Science Hero</a>. There's a reason why he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a> in-universe.

He can kick ass when the occasion calls for it, but given that he has less in the way of combat training than most of the other characters, he tends to prefer to achieve victory through manipulation and coordination with other characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, Yukimura is intelligent and is very good at taking in the bigger picture and using that knowledge to manipulate people into doing what he wants without ever having to fight himself.

He prefers to play politics to sideline his opponents most of the time. For instance, at one point after losing his most important fighter and being attacked by the two most powerful armies in that universe - the Chinese and the Brittanian - he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">manipulates the Eunuch Generals into announcing their evil plans to their entire country</a>, inciting riots and cutting off their Brittanian support. This plan went very smoothly because he managed to steal it from a third opponent without that third opponent ever telling something about it, who had no choice but to support Lelouch after this fight. Using politics he sidelined one bad empire, destroyed a second one, and got the support of the third one.
</li><li> The heroine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a> does this in her original incarnation and '90s OVA's. While other adaptations turn her into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">idiot heroine</a>, her first manga series portrayed her as a very clever woman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a> that used several tactics including charm, manipulation, distraction, and lies to advance her investigations and go straight to the source of the evil. Unlike the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior">magical girl warriors</a> that this manga inspired, she didn't resort into ass-kicking immediately, favoring detective work, stealth, and the simple solution. But, of course, when the time for fight does come, she becomes unbeatable. And similar to the way she manipulates to achieve her goals, during fights she is never ashamed of using whatever type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism">dirty tricks</a> she feels necessary.

</li><li> Near, who is L's successor as the Heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a>. He makes a lot of inspiring speeches (when his assistants moan about how well Kira, Mello, and the mafia seem to be doing), but some that are clearly insincere.

His penchant for strategy, faking out opponents, and making himself be underestimated are a requirement when constantly facing stronger opponents like he and his Digimon partner Zeromaru do on a regular basis. Especially in a series where most of the antagonists are strategists themselves.

</li><li> Vegito also counts. Hell, him manipulating Super Buu and frustrating him into acting desperately was <em>the main plan</em> to saving his sons, friend, and the whole universe.

This partially stems from their decentralized nature (they have no concrete organization, mostly rely on cellphones and the Internet for communications, and the only form of 'hierarchy' is that the founder is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> but he's usually a hand-offs kind of guy) and it's partially because the vast majority of members are rank and file civilians of all ages, so many have to help using whatever means they have at hand, even if it's not in a direct fighting capacity, which Episode 22 of the anime shows in great detail.
</li><li> Akira from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast">Eden of the East</a></em>, as expected from a series about a bunch of people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalPhone">Supernatural Phones</a> and an obscene amount of money trying to outwit each other (except that Akira also manages to do it all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">with amnesia</a></em>.)

How did he get his players? Blackmail, manipulation, or the ultimate fallback, guns. Lots of guns. What does he do with his players? Gives them all nicknames that start with "Fucking," and puts them through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> including running up Tokyo Tower and pushing a truck from Texas to Las Vegas. What does he do to his opponents? All out psychological warfare, showing his hand, taunting unmercifully and cackling madly (even through a freshly broken arm if he has to.) He keeps innumerable calculations going on in his head and strategizes on the fly, willing (and eager) to go for the insanest of insane trick plays. He's a terror, but he has the absolute loyalty of his players (even the ones he recruited at gunpoint) who are willing to push themselves to insane heights right along with him (although they would be happier if he left his guns at home).

</li><li> All of the protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. While they all do have their fair share of fighting skill, most battles are decided by the winners taking advantage of their opponentsÂ’ weaknesses, physical or mental.

</li><li> Kurapica from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter Ã— Hunter</a></em>. He successfully convinces eleven of the most dangerous criminals in the world that any deviation from his directives, namely any harm done to his friends they hold hostage, will result in the immediate death of their leader Chrollo (whom Kurapica has captured.) During the course of their hostage exchange itself, he successfully de-powers Chrollo and separates him from his followers for the foreseeable future. And he ensures that if the Ryodan's negotiator reveals any personal information she learned during their negotiation, she will die, removing a significant threat his future plans as well as one of the more stable members of the Ryodan even if she doesn't uphold the deal. Keep in mind that up until this point the Ryodan has successfully curb-stomped their way through all obstacles, and Kurapica himself is only capable of restraining one of them at a time. And he managed to get ahold of Chrollo in the first place by simply turning off the lights.
</li><li> Toru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IrisZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IrisZero">Iris Zero</a></em> lacks the eye powers of his peers. Instead, he is able to construct situations and use his friends' abilities to achieve a noble goal.

Some fans believe that it's actually a mixture of both; that Tylor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">has somehow become enlightened to the extent of becoming a bodhisattva</a> through his original simple, happy-go-lucky ways and that most, if not all, of his antics in the series are part of a plan to help the others on the Soyokaze achieve enlightenment too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>: All of the protagonists.

</li><li> Jotaro is also very noteworthy: later arcs have villains being cautious of him, claiming it's not his super-powerful Stand that makes him dangerous, but his genius intellect and cunning.

Nevertheless, he's so charismatic that he's very popular with the Cappies, and they even made a mini-figure of him. At the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he reveals that he had been building his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Battleship Halberd</a> in King Dedede's basement ever since he came to Dreamland to everybody can battle Nightmare from inside it during their final assault on his fortress</span>.

</li><li> Sun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfSunKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfSunKnight">The Legend of Sun Knight</a></em>. Having low physical endurance and strength, and sword skills that are "not very good," as well as having been trained to hide his magic talent, Sun can't openly muscle his way through most challenges. He still fights openly with spells when he doubts he'll be recognized, but his preferred tactics are to manipulate others into doing what he wants, something which is helped by the appearance he maintains as an attractive figurehead. Those who know his true nature consider his friend Judge to be the one who maintains the church from the front while saying Sun's place is to sneak around and mess with things behind the scenes.
</li><li> Akiyama from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em>.

<ul><li> Akiyama's partner Nao, the main heroine is this of the emotional variety. Without her, in fact, Akiyama would have long lost.

<ul><li> Sasuke Uchiha showed characteristics of this type when he was still a member of the Hidden Leaf. An example was the Chuunin Exam in the Forest of Death: He noticed shadow clones with ease, mostly because he analyzed the behaviour of his teammates.
</li><li> Shikamaru Nara of Team 10 is widely considered the greatest strategist in Konoha. His accomplishments include out-gambitting a pair of Akatsuki members (extremely dangerous S-Rank criminals, one of whom battled the First Hokage himself), beating his mentor Asuma at Shogi (a Japanese equivalent to chess), and being named the first chunin of his age group, due to his remarkable tactics in his fight against Temari.
</li><li> Shino Aburame is also an excellent example, due to his brutally pragmatic and underhanded approach to almost anything. His first fight was over before it started due to him filling his opponent's arm tubes with bugs before the match even began.

<ul><li> Example #1: When fighting an opponent who sees sound and can knock you out, what do you do?

She was basically blind and couldn't fight it and, unlike the goddesses, that broom aimed to kill with each shot.
</li><li> Example #2, In Hell, they have to fight a demon who can PUNCH OUT LIGHTNING in order to advance to the next room. Keiichi's solution? Have Urd make him a super-speed pill so he can trick said demon into punching the door out of existence for them by goading her into attacking him while he stands in front of the door; then, when the pill takes effect, BOOK IT out of the way. The Demon later asks him what he would've done if the door didn't break, and he calmly replies that "If the door didn't break, it would've broken your fist, so either way, we'd have won". Needless to say, she's impressed with him, even admitting he bested her like a good sport instead of making snarky remarks like the last demon he outwitted.

The whole point of his character is that he contrasts the other, burly Vikings by his brains and lack of brawn. He demonstrates this by making a snare-throwing device to compensate his lack of physical prowess, observation skills in noting how the dragon he downs acts and slowly develops a relationship with the powerful dragon, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">develops an artificial tailfin for the dragon to allow him to fly once again</span>, and trying to end the hatred his people have for dragons by finding the root cause of their raids on the island.

<ul><li> In his introduction, Nick shows his commerce skills in buying one jumbo pop ice cream, which is larger than as his whole body, melting it, using his-size Popsicle sticks to create dozens of tiny Popsicles, selling them to some lemmings, reselling the now discarded red wood to a mouse construction unit. With the costs of $20-$30 from the popsicle, smaller sticks, and gas, he nets over $300 on a single day. And he does it <em>daily.</em>
</li><li> During her training, Judy discovered the harsh landscapes and buildings designed for larger animals makes things like climbing a wall that is over 10 times her height impossible. However, she realizes her natural agility allows her to climb the wall by using other cadets as platforms to jump off of. Her instructor is very impressed, and by doing other similar tactics Judy graduates at the top of her class. She later blackmails Nick into helping her by noting with all that money he makes, he doesn't file any taxes on his income and records the whole conversation. Nick's partner laughs his tail off and agrees she schooled Nick good.

By his own account, he's a magical thug with the subtlety of a sledgehammer - though he develops his skills considerably over the series. However, a lot of Wizardry is about using some external power source or applying leverage carefully, or of storing a spell or power in advance in a potion or device.

In his entire career, the guy hardly ever leaves his desk in London and undertakes almost no truly dangerous field missions. But despite all of that, he has the analytical mind necessary to piece together disparate clues to deduce Mother Russia's most intimate secrets from half a world away.

For example: laying the groundwork for Bronn to champion him a full episode before he even knew there'd be a trial by combat. He's also able to talk his way from a situation where he's likely to be murdered by hill tribesmen to getting said hill tribesmen to serve as his bodyguards.
</li><li> Robb Stark, once he begins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingLeader">resisting the Lannisters</a>, is forced to fight this way. He's massively outnumbered and is forced to fight with masterful tactics. Fortunately, he is one of the best tacticians and strategists Westeros has ever seen, and he wins battle after battle (moving him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror">Young Conqueror</a> territory, as well).
</li><li> Margaery Tyrell, who is something of an enigma in the novels, has much more (visible) agency in the show. Her grandmother the Queen of Thorns is the Chessmaster behind House Tyrell, visibly teaches Margaery everything she knows. Notably, she's the only person able to reign in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">King Joffrey</a> with any consistency, she instantly gains the love of the common people, and when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tommen ascends the throne, it's not long before he's eating out of her hand as well</span>. She puts on different facades when it comes to protecting her family, and is very much heroic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but her lack of the ruthlessness, and preference for using manipulation and love over violence and fear, which makes her heroic in the first place, is what gets her killed in the end</span>.
</li><li> Arya Stark, once forced to go on the run, isn't much of a threat due to being a young girl, and is surrounded by heavily-armed and potentially-hostile adults which has fostered quick thinking on her part just to stay alive and avoid being captured by the Lannisters. She proves quite adept at using her wits to survive, such as when she uses them to force a skilled assassin to help her escape Harrenhal.
</li><li> Despite his rough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">Old Soldier</a> appearance, Davos Seaworth uses charisma, honesty, and diplomacy to bring allies to the cause of his king, such as when he brings Salladhor Saan into Stannis' service and then when he convinces the all-powerful Iron Bank of Braavos (an institution he formerly tried to rob and who have neither forgotten nor forgiven) into backing Stannis on pure nerve and implacable logic. He used to be a smuggler, an occupation that requires you to avoiding fighting as much as possible and has only once drawn his sword. His experience helps compensate for Stannis' complete lack of charisma.
</li><li> After losing his sword hand, Jaime is forced to rely on his wits and cunning to achieve his desires, such as playing on Steelshanks' sense of self-preservation to help him rescue Brienne.
</li><li> Bronn is this crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero">Action Hero</a>. In his fight against Ser Vardis at the Eyrie, he declines a shield and constantly dodges out of Vardis' way until he's too tired to resist Bronn, who kills him. When he and Jaime are intercepted by some Dornish soldiers, he tries to avoid (or at least delay) a direct confrontation by coming up with a cover story about their being stranded. If Jaime hadn't ruined it, he might have succeeded.
</li><li> Grey Worm incites the slave revolt that topples Meereen from within.
</li><li> For 6 seasons, Sansa Stark was held hostage by various powerful enemies who helped kill her family, under the constant threat of death or torture, without any hope of rescue or even comfort. Then she's rescued and uses her bitter experience to become an infinitely more ruthless schemer and politician than her brother, the noble King in the North.

From lying about his ship's capability multiple times to disguising himself as the enemy or pretending to know things he had no way of knowing just to throw his opponent off. Kirk owed much of his success to his enemies' inability to tell if somebody is lying.

True, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>, but He was also a master at outsmarting the PharisÃ©sâ€” often using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">their own words</a> against them. One example is the famous "cast the first stone" story; He saves a woman by putting her prosecutors in a double bind.

</li></ul></li><li> Common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Celtic Mythology</a> - the Celts considered defeating your enemies through trickery just as noble and praiseworthy as fighting them directly, with truly great warriors being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">capable of both</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Odysseus</a> must surely be the patron saint of the Guile Hero. In an age when most Greek heroes were part-divine, unstoppable, ass-kicking badasses, along comes Odysseus, whose greatest weapon is his mind, officially making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. Having the blood of Hermes, the Greek Pantheon's trickster god, makes him even better.
<ul><li> Being a personal favorite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Athena</a>, the goddess of guile heroines, didn't hurt either.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Hercules</a> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a>, but he wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> alone wasn't enough for several of his Labors, so he had to use his brain alongside it. When he found out that the Nemean Lion's hide was impervious to weapons, he strangled it with his bare hands. To fight the Hydra, which could grow its heads back, either he or his friend Iolaus seared the stumps with a torch right after cutting them (though relying on Iolaus rendered this Labour invalid since he was supposed to do them alone). To clean up the enormous and never-cleaned Aegean Stables, he used his strength to alter the course of two nearby rivers and make them pass through (though this was also rendered invalid â€” see below).
<ul><li> He was also great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploys</a>. Having been poisoned via wearing a cape doused in the blood of a Centaur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">that he killed with poison arrows</a>, Hercules was headed to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a> - but then he asked his people to burn him <em>alive</em> in his own funerary pyre, knowing that it would <em>hurt even more</em> for a while but betting that his father Zeus would see it and make him ascend to the Olympus ASAP. He was right.
<ul><li> A little explanation on the Augean Stables example above. Hercules was ordered by the Gods to serve his jealous cousin Eurystheus. Eurystheus, already having failed to kill him decided to humiliate him instead and ordered him to clean the Augean Stables. King Augeas had not cleaned them in 30 years. Hercules first surveys the area and notices the two rivers. He then went to King Augeas promising to clean the stables in a day, if Augeas would give him a tenth of his cattle. Augeas thinking that it was impossible and that he'd be getting a free days labor out of him agreed. Hercules brings his own sons in to watch Augeas swear an oath and then diverts to rivers to pass through the stables. Cleaning them out. Augeas is forced to give up his cattle. Hercules walks away not getting his hands dirty, rich, and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">played</a> two kings. However, this backfired on Hercules. Whether it was because the <em>rivers</em> (and by extension their river gods) technically did the work or because Hercules took payment from Augeas for the deed, this Labour was considered invalid. This is why Hercules ended up doing Twelve Labours instead of just ten.

</li><li> Per Gynt from Norwegian folklore qualifies as one of these. Most of the sticky situations he gets in he resolves by outsmarting the baddie. In one example, he convinces a hungry troll not to eat him by challenging him to a contest of feats of strength. In the rock crushing contest, Per squeezes the piece of cheese in his pocket, impressing the troll by squeezing "the water from a stone." In a rock-throwing contest, Per grabs a bird out of a nearby bush and gives it a hurl. Needless to say, he was not eaten.
<ul><li> Peer Gynt was inspired by Askeladden, an even older Guile Hero archetype who is the Norwegian version of Jack.

<ul><li> In tabletop RPGs, while storytelling-oriented Game Masters tend to leave these things to players, there often are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassAndLevelSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassAndLevelSystem">classes</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">character builds</a> which are oriented towards smarts and talk. The bard could be a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> example, due to high Charisma score.
</li><li> Canonically, Justin Xiang Allard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is regarded as one of the best Mechwarriors of his timeÂ… but not through any factor of speed or personal fortitude. He is, however, one of the most <em>cunning</em> warriors ever shown in the series. In his main appearances:
<ul><li> He is first shown fighting a 'Mech twice with twice his size and hideous amounts of firepowerÂ… and almost wins by destroying its engine, except it pulled a trick he didn't expect.
</li><li> He next is shown on in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Gladiator Games</a> fighting a faster enemy with effective short-range weapons while he is slower, using a new 'Mech among other things, and armed mostly with long-range weapons with a minimum range. He wins by unexpectedly firing some of his weapons ahead of his enemy, tricking him into pulling up short and right into Justin's sights.
</li><li> Justin next fights in a battle where his machine is slower and has less armor and long-range firepower, and he is riding a 'Mech known to have unreliable weaponsÂ… so he tricks his foe into closing into close range, having <em>equipped a very-short-range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a></em> beforehand that visually resembles the unreliable weapon. He annihilates his enemy's 'Mech in two shots.
</li><li> Now that his modified 'Mech is a known variable, his next enemy (his first foe defeated in the games, as mentioned earlier) attempts to pilot a model of 'Mech that crippled Justin, which still has greater range and more firepower than his machine, and even manages to disable the BFG early on. Attempting to use the tactic that maimed Justin, the other pilot is tricked into shooting Justin's main gun moreÂ… only to reveal that his 'Mech can literally punch through his enemy's back.
</li><li> Facing a skilled champion who cheats dirtily, he overcomes the trap by summarily destroying two of his ambushers by hitting from an unexpected position and dealing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>. He knows that his rival will try to shoot him from behindÂ… and marches into the obvious trap area <em>backwards</em> so that he presents strong armor to his enemy, who he overcomes.
</li><li> At one point, it's mentioned he won a battle by tricking the enemy commander into making a bad maneuver by giving a false report, using the enemy nation's native language to convince him that it was legitimate.
</li><li> Finally, when he is tasked to face an old friend in combat, he once again allows his enemy to fire on him as he closes, knowing that while his foe is piloting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">the same model of machine</a>, his BFG can quickly overcome his enemy's armor, and his former friend did <em>not</em> pay enough attention to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Gladiator Games</a> to remember the change Justin had made until it was too late.
</li><li> Notably, when he was once tasked to go in a straight-up open fight with no chance for mind games or sneakiness, he lost handily to his son, who while a Guile Hero himself is also considered a naturally gifted pilot in terms of raw skill.
</li><li> Outside of combat, Justin's story involves perhaps one of the biggest and most complicated scam operations in the history of the Inner Sphereâ€”through a combination of exile, injury, and disgrace, he comes into the employ of the mortal enemy of his former liege lord. For several years he plays the role of a quisling, helping said enemy, Chancellor Maximillian Liao, make small but noticeable advances against Hanse Davion, his former lord. It all comes together at the end of the entire ploy, where the advantages Liao thought he had gained proved to be vulnerabilities instead, essentially getting Liao forces steamrolled in a very short, very one-sided war where all of Liao's weaknesses were set up by Justin's advice and machinations to Chancellor LiaoÂ… as he was in fact still loyal to Hanse Davion, and taking this entire mission <em>on orders</em> from Davion.

Vastly outnumbered (Hira's forces outnumbered the Ansei <em>thirty to one</em>) and, despite their skills, woefully unprepared to form into an organized army, Frandar devised the "Hammer and Anvil" strategy to get around the weaknesses of his army. He devised a plan of seven battles, each leading Hira's forces deeper and deeper into the Yokudan wilderness. The first six battles had no clear winner, as was Frandar's intention, but drew Hira's force further and further out. In the seventh battle, at the foot of Mount Hattu (where Frandar lived as a hermit for 30 years while writing the Book of Circles), the "hammer" struck. Frandar's Ansei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">killed over three-hundred thousand</a> of Hira's men, winning the war.

<div class="indent">He was a very persuasive individual, and after the raid, increasingly used all of his skills to protect his <em>Schindlerjuden</em> ("Schindler's Jews"), as they came to be called. Schindler went out of his way to take care of the Jews who worked at DEF, often calling on his legendary charm and ingratiating manner to help his workers get out of difficult situations. Once, says author Eric Silver in <em>The Book of the Just</em>, "Two Gestapo men came to his office and demanded that he hand over a family of five who had bought forged Polish identity papers. 'Three hours after they walked in,' Schindler said, 'two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded.'"
</div><ul><li> A lot of the people Schindler rescued had stories to tell about him, including this one from Helen Hirsch, notorious Nazi Amon Goeth's Jewish maid: one night, while playing cards with Goeth, Schindler plied him with plenty of booze and got him very drunk, and persuaded him to gamble with Hirsch as a stake in the game. Withâ€”no doubtâ€”a little help from the booze, Schindler stacked the deck and cheated outrageously to make sure he had the winning hand. Then, when Goeth tried to welch on his bet, Schindler said something like "Now, now, Goeth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">you play fair!"</a> and that's how he won her life in a card game.
