He goes nuts and kills them all. Even worse, he thinks eating the meat caused him to become an alien himself and he tries to side with them against humanity, calling them his real family. An alien kills him right after he frees it from containment.

Unfortunately, the gas actually deploys and they can't turn it off. He comes back as a slasher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> sees many of his murders: Simply as pranks. Part of the Joker's warped world view is that life itself is just a cruel joke, so he sees no difference between a classic pie in the face, or a poison pie full of acid. Occasionally, he'll pull a completely harmless joke just because the victim is clearly pissing himself in fear and expecting the worst.
</li><li> Ironically, this is inverted on the Joker himself in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em>. At one point he is marrying Harley and shoves her face into the wedding cake. In return, she slits his throat. And, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">killing someone over a harmless prank may seem a "little" harsh,</a> the implication is that he abused her so much she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">finally had enough.</a>
</li><li> In "The Ugliest Man in The World" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a></em> #3, a fraternity hazing gone wrong results in a pledge being accidentally injected with a random mixture of chemicals. Miraculously, this somehow does not kill him, but he vanishes afterwards, becoming a recluse and returning years later to extract vengeance on those he blames (rightly) for his disfigurement.
</li></ul></li><li> One standalone issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> features a couple of human boys who decide to play a prank on the "spirits" (elves). It all goes disastrously wrong, with two elves dying and one of the boys being executed by the human tribe's elders.
</li><li> In "Last Laugh!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesFromTheCrypt">Tales from the Crypt</a></em> #38, the main character dresses several pounds of bloody horse meat in boy's clothing, dumps it on the railroad tracks and then screams right after a train goes by as a "prank" on several local boys playing nearby. This results in a chain reaction which gets the town doctor's wife and two sons killed. Naturally, this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a>, said doctor plays a rather improbable revenge "prank."
</li><li> <em>Plop!</em> #4 likewise has a story called <a class="urllink" href="http://andeverythingelsetoo.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/the-last-laugh.html">"The Last Laugh!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingSalesman">Traveling Salesman</a> for a practical joke company comes across a beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmersDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmersDaughter">Farmer's Daughter</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Only problem is, she's a psychopath with a really sick sense of humor; after she and her family enjoy his pranks all day, he comes to see her that night, whereupon she cuts his head off with a hatchet as her own "prank".</span>

When Naruto's various Chuunin friends/clients arrive, Naruto was in the middle of facing off against a <em>bear</em>. Despite everyone's attempts, Sarutobi finds out and slaps a massive fine on Anko while making her Naruto's tutor for the next several months. He notes that the only reason Anko is getting off so lightly is that Naruto was unhurt.

The girl had asthma, and the powder set off an attack so severe she couldn't swallow her medication. She nearly died, and this set off an inter-house prank war lasting most of the year in revenge. To make it worse, evidence suggests that the twins didn't learn anything from this. A few years later, they ruined the academic prospects of one of their own housemates by lacing his bedclothes with itching powder, causing him to need medical attention when he woke up in the morning with a severe full-body rash and ruining his concentration on a major test. And then a few years after that they were expelled after a series of pranks that started with them setting off fireworks in the Great Hall during mealtime, causing numerous injuries.

Cosby falls for the prank, but when he in turn is asked to go out and find someone to prank as well, it backfires horribly for him.

Kim was the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il, and the half-brother of current leader Kim Jong-un. He was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport when two young women came up behind him and splashed some liquid on his face in a "Guess Who?!" prank, then walked away. He immediately felt something was wrong, and contacted a receptionist, but he was soon sweaty, unresponsive and vomiting blood. He was dead within two hours. The two young woman, Siti Aisyah and Đoàn Thị Hương, were quickly identified and arrested from CCTV footage. It turned out that they had been training—or so they thought—to be on a prank TV show, and had been under the impression that they were simply pranking some random guy. The liquid they had splashed on Kim had been the deadly VX nerve agent. Their handlers, the people who'd persuaded them that it was all for an innocent TV show, were never found. The court eventually concluded that there was zero evidence that either of the women had the faintest idea that they were committing a murder. Siti Aisyah's charge was dropped, and Đoàn Thị Hương was released after little more than a year in prison.
