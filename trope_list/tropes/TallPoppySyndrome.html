Tall Poppy Syndrome is in play when a character or characters act to achieve parity with another character who is presented or perceived as somehow "better", not by improving themselves but by bringing the other guy down to their level.
</p><p>This trope is often found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopias</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack Worlds</a>, and may also show up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine Worlds</a>. Indeed, in a Crapsaccharine World, Tall Poppy Syndrome may be the first clue that everything isn't as sweet and nice as it appears on the surface. Common in social ghettos and places where institutionalized categorism (e.g. racism) results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveCategorism">aggressive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism">internalized</a> categorism, with people of a certain category (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, species, mutant etc.) believing  even on a subconscious level  that they are inferior and should act in a certain way, and hence pull down and demean anyone who acts differently, rises to greatness, or escapes the social ghetto. Expect this variation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">futuristic</a> worlds that have social divide or contain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopian</a> elements, and from writers who are trying to write social commentary about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>  with whom it's a particular favorite.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The term comes from a story about Tarquin the Proud, last king of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">ancient Rome</a>. Tarquin was asked what to do with the leading men of an enemy city his soldiers had captured. He sliced the heads off the tallest poppies in his garden and so the enemy leaders were put to death by beheading. The idea, however, is even older: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories">Herodotus describes</a> Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus, doing the same thing in a grain field as advice to Periander, who had just seized power in Corinth.
</p><p>This attitude is prevalent in collectivist and hierarchical cultures, as evidenced by the various names that many cultures have for it. For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japanese</a> proverb <em>Deru kugi utareru</em>  "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down", which not only refers to ambition, but <em>anyone</em> who fails to conform; a similar English proverb uses the term "proud nail" with a bonus pun between "standing proud" (i.e. not flat) and the sin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>. There's the Scandinavian concept of the "Jantelov" ("the Law of Jante"; see in Literature below); the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Philippine</a> <em>Crab Mentality</em> or "Crab Bucket Syndrome", based on the myth that if you have at least two crabs in a bucket, you don't need to have a lid, because the other(s) prevent any one member from trying to climb out of it; and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">Dutch</a> proverb <em>boven het maaiveld uitsteken</em>, more or less literally, "standing out above the level at which the field is mown". In Chinese, "the tall bird must be shot at". In Korean, "An angular stone is bound to be chiselled." A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russian</a> proverb "Вот радость  у соседа корова сдохла" (<em>Vot radost'  u soseda korova sdokhla</em> "What a joy, a neighbour's cow has died") describes the <em>schadenfreude</em> borne out of such mentality.

<ul><li> In one Cheerios commercial, a father with a pair of little twin girls is trying to read his newspaper when one of them complains that the other has more Cheerios in her bowl than she does. To even things up, he digs a spoonful out from the other twin's bowl and eats it... only to decide upon tasting it that he "needs" to take some more scoops from either bowl to make them equal. Numerous scoops later, he leaves exactly <em>two</em> Cheerios in each bowl. "There. Now they're equal." The twins stare at their bowls for a while, and then the other one says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredAesop">"She's got</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">more milk."</a>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Haganai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Haganai">Haganai</a></em> Yozora frequently attempts to sabotage, belittle or humiliate others who she feels are getting in the way of her friendship/potential romance with Kodaka. She refuses to make any sort of attempt herself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>, this is something that main character Soma Yukihira very much endures in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> school. A good majority of the student body resent his talent and achievements and frequently try to downplay them. One notable example is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> where despite making it all the way to the finals along with two other top chefs from his generation, Soma is treated as a complete afterthought between them by the students. True to form, the students are jealous of his hard-working attitude and acknowledging that would mean acknowledging that they do not work as hard as Soma does.
</li><li> Averting this trope is the reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nico Niyama</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kiznaiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kiznaiver">Kiznaiver</a></em> acts the way she does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Being rich, smart and cute, she fears that she'd be resented for it and end up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a>. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> act is her way of appearing less perfect, and therefore more normal, to others.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, with the villain attack at USJ and with each successive crisis Class 1-A, or members of the class, have endured and overcome. Peers at U.A., particularly amongst the other courses, have clearly grown to resent Class 1-A, believing them to be unrepentant glory hogs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyTeenRomanticComedySNAFU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyTeenRomanticComedySNAFU">My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU</a></em>, heroine Yukinoshita Yukino says that she's been the victim of this for much of her life, having few friends because the other girls resented her superiority, and having to deal with the frustration of being surrounded by lazy people who'd rather drag her down than raise themselves up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Kakashi uses the nail proverb to describe Sasuke during the bell challenge.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>. While the younger generations of Ghoul Investigators practically worship the legendary Kishou Arima, it turns out that the older generation almost universally resent him. Many were shown to have been openly rude to him as a rookie, viewing him as a threat that made them look bad in comparison. As such, it's very clear that most of his career has been spent isolated from others through a wall of resentment or worship.
</li><li> One of the running themes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em> is the sextuplets' inability to let each other succeed at anything, with Osomatsu being the most blatant about it out of fear that any change will permanently drift them apart. It gets to a point where when an accident creates Kamimatsu, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of the brothers' collective goodness, they try to kill him on the basis of <em>giving their parents higher standards to expect from them.</em>

The first episode has her overhear two girls badmouthing her in a bathroom and breaks out laughing, reveling in being better than them. Her fabulous luck turns out to be so extreme that it threatens reality's karmic structure and the goddess of misfortune is sent in to hammer her down, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">middling results</a>.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">more serious</a> joke: A man sits in his room and complains about his bad life.

<div class="indent"><strong>The Kingpin:</strong> They, "society," hate you because they don't want your help. You remind them of how weak-willed and sheep-like and unspecial they are. How gleeful they are, deep down, to be ordinary. They don't want heroes. They don't want special people around them. Because if there are special people and they aren't one of them— well, who wants that? Who wants a constant reminder that they aren't even trying to be special? See, the difference between you and I is that you really are just a child. You benefit from the wide-eyed optimism of youth. I do envy that, somewhat. But... like many of your decisions in life... it's just naive. And I don't envy that harsh cold slap of reality that will come your way soon enough. But I guess it's inevitable. People don't want to be special. I do think that. It is my philosophy. They— people want to be told what to do and how to live and they want men like me to tell them. They want to go to work and do as little as they can possibly get away with, and they want a big cookie at the end of the day for doing it. And they want men like me to give it to them.

<ul><li> One of the major themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> revolves around this idea, where the superheroes are forced to give up "hero work". Originally this was because of a series of lawsuits and increasing public outrage and mistrust of supers in general; years later, this means Dash isn't allowed to go out in sports because he'd be too good with his Speedster powers (and too competitive to not use them), as well as outing him and his family as supers. The villain, Syndrome, wants to make all of his "superhero" inventions and weapons available to the public so that "when everyone's super, no one will be". Syndrome's philosophy is actually the antithesis of this trope  raising everyone else so the people who naturally excel are average. Not a bad idea in principle, but there are three major problems with his implementation:
<ul><li> Syndrome is motivated by megalomania and revenge, and his fondness for dangerous weapons means that "making everyone super" could result in catastrophic destruction.
</li><li> He's murdered dozens of superheroes in the process of improving one of these weapons, the Omnidroid, so it will be powerful enough to kill Mr. Incredible; the focus of his revenge and - from what we're shown - one of the best superheroes in the world.
</li><li> He explicitly states that he's only going to hand out all of his advanced technology <em>after</em> he's "grown old and had [his] fun", meaning that <em>he's</em> going to be more special than everyone else until he decides to retire.
</li><li> Dash meanwhile is ultimately allowed to join the Track team, but is forced to limit himself to a "close second". The chance to do something and get a little glory without exposing his powers is enough for him, and he seems happy.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfPinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio</a></em>, the blue fairy promised him he'd become a real boy if he's always well-behaved and gets good grades in school. Then one day, the other boys tell him that the monster whale was seen near their place and that they should skip school to look for it. Pinocchio hesitates but then decides to join them because he cares about Geppetto. When they go to the sea, no whale. Pinocchio gets suspicious and wants to know what's going on. Then, the other boys tell him, that they'll look bad if he's an A-student, but if everyone in class was as lazy as they are, they'd be just average. This fact is often omitted in the adaptations, with the major exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/UnBurattinoDiNomePinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/UnBurattinoDiNomePinocchio">the Giuliano Cenci version</a>.
</li><li> This is the entire point of the book <em>Among Friends</em> by Caroline B. Cooney. Jennie Quint is regarded as pretty much perfect (except for math) at her school and she's a super-overachiever. Jennie herself isn't an egotist or a snob, but even her very best friends are getting really fed up with constantly being overshadowed by Jennie's perfection.

It's always portrayed as the greatest evil society perpetuates, with repeated connections to Marx's slogan, "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need" which the novel's government and Twentieth Century Motor Company interpret as "punish those with ability, and reward those without." In fact, this is the central motivation of all her villains in all her novels.

</li><li> The Scandinavian term <em>Janteloven</em> ("the Jante law" or "the law of Jante") comes from the 1933 novel <em>A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks</em> by Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose. In this book, the first-person narrator comes from a small town called Jante in Denmark, where the working-class inhabitants follow the unwritten Jante law, which consists of rules that basically boil down to "You're <em>shit</em> just like us, and don't you <em>dare</em> forget it."

The main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScholarshipStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScholarshipStudent">Kimberly Chang</a>, is repeatedly shown to be jealous of her much wealthier classmates. On a more serious note, Kimberly's aunt forces her and her mother to live in a dangerous, roach-infested apartment and work long hours of hard labor in a Chinatown sweatshop from fear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Kimberly</a> will be more successful than her son.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HuckleberryFinn">Huckleberry Finn</a></em>, Huck's father (a slovenly, abusive, and neglectful drunkard) is absolutely enraged by the fact that Huck is getting an education and a chance at a decent shot in life, because he thinks that now Huck is going to think he's above his dad.

</li><li> The Thorburn family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pact">Pact</a></em> have been twisted by the desire for a massive inheritance from Rosalyn Thorburn, and actively sabotage any attempts to better themselves-if one gets into a good college, another will ruin her chances. At this point, it's largely reflexive for them to spitefully verbally attack one another whenever they meet. Blake Thorburn, the narrator, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWhoMadeItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWhoMadeItOut">The One Who Made It Out</a> by running away.
</li><li> Discussed in "Screwtape Proposes a Toast" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters">The Screwtape Letters</a></em>. Screwtape, a senior devil from Hell, discusses how Tall Poppy Syndrome can be used to undermine democracy. While a full discussion would become a lengthy entry, the short version is that Screwtape says the Devils can undermine democracy and education - the government <em>least</em> inclined toward the Hellward road and one of humanity's greatest achievements, respectively - by introducing mediocrity in a citizenry that refuses to accept excellence. Talented individuals become <em>ashamed</em> of their talents because their excellence elevates them. In short, while "the Enemy" (i.e. God) would want humans to excel while remaining humble and kind, the devils want humans to be proud but mediocre. Screwtape best summarizes it as confusing the message "All men are created equal," meaning all humans deserve rights, equal protection before the law, and to be valued as individuals, with "All men are created equal," to mean no one is truly more virtuous, more talented, more industrious, or more capable. The full lecture goes into much greater detail.
</li><li> This is a major factor in most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> stories  the Establishment is deeply offended that a common soldier born to poverty could have become an officer. Then even more offended when he goes around being better at it than them. Similarly, a lot of the common soldiers resent being given orders by a "jumped-up Sergeant". To the point where they attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">frag</a> him several times.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> continuity, the book <em>The Truce at Bakura</em> introduces a religion called the "Cosmic Balance", which essentially advocates this, as if you attempt to better yourself a great deal then other people will suffer to keep the balance. The religion doesn't like the Jedi due to their having had vast power, seeing their eradication by the Emperor as a balancing effect.
</li><li> The Imperial Order from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series is a very literal embodiment of this trope. Under their belief, everyone is meant to give to those who have less than them, and anyone who doesn't should be put to death. They want to kill all who can use magic because there are many who can't. They sack entire cities because the people who live there just want to live their own lives rather than join the Order. Though the leaders often openly contradict their own beliefs (just being leaders shows they think they are superior and, by their own ideals, should give up authority) it is often a society run by mob rule. As Nikki eloquently puts it, "The Order teaches us that to be better than someone is to be worse than everyone."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em>, Atticus complains that "All men are equal" has led to schoolteachers who promote all students instead of holding back underachievers.

When one of them, main character Kip Penfold, dares to apply to a college for sorcery, his family are ostracized by most of the local Calatian community for fear of reprisal for one of their number "reaching above his station", to the point where they have to move.
</li><li> Discussed in the third <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TroyRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TroyRising">Troy Rising</a></em> novel, when Comet is transferred to the <em>Thermopylae</em> and is now in charge of a squad of Latin American engineers (all male). They immediately take a disliking to her for being an overachiever, an American, and a woman. She also learns that the other squads regularly steal one another's tools. Her goal is to make her squad the best on the station, but a fellow squad leader explains that Latin Americans prefer to sabotage the best over trying to become better than them. There may be some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> involved here. In fact, by going to official channels about the tool theft, she is seen as a "cheater" and someone who has hurt their honor.

Dating couple Abbie and Ryan won the first leg which put a target on their backs as no one else wanted them to get it. In leg 7, they took a gamble on a flight with a small layover that didnt work out. They ended up about 12 hours behind everyone else with the another couple team Josh &amp; Brent. While they were missing, the other three teams left plotted the plan that would end up being the nail in their coffin. Once they were both able to catch up with the teams in leg 9, 2nd place Jaymes &amp; James had U-turned them while 3rd place Trey &amp; Lexi U-turned the guys to burn the spot.

The frat boys did it because Mike's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a> made him an A+ student and they felt that he made them look lazy and stupid in comparison.

If someone makes too good of a showing, the other contestants deem him/her a threat and vote them out. Justified since this format really is a zero-sum game where others' success comes at the expense of your own. However, this has been going on long enough that an inversion has come into play: people have realized that if someone makes too <em>poor</em> of a showing, then they're valuable to keep around to win against — and they paradoxically become a threat in their own right, since the other players have more incentive to keep <em>them</em> over <em>you</em>. As a result, players will sometimes specifically target the underachiever in order to create an opening for themselves.

</div></li><li> "The Trees" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> is this trope by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a>, although lyricist Neil Peart claims the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotPolitical">wasn't intended to have a political interpretation</a>.

This notion of bringing down people acting above their station (IE, better than everyone else, making the narrator out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everyman</a>) is also used to rebut a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a> in the second verse and backtalk a judge attempting to shut down a brothel in the third verse.
</li><li> This is why critics in the U.K. hated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> so much.

</div></li><li> Nineties roots-rock band The Badlees riffed on this with their song "I Liked You Better When You Hated Yourself", about a former friend who embraces the self-help lifestyle, although it's not completely one-sided; it sounds like the song's subject is suffering from some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a>.

Thankfully, this trope dies down as their careers go by, but there are still some people who hate on them to this day.

They were as close as Dipper and Mabel were, but Ford's intelligence made him much more valued by the adults in their life and the comparisons caused no end of grief for Stan. This spilled over when Ford's own resentment of always being with his twin damaged their relationship for decades, especially when their first reunion led to Ford vanishing, all because of a fight caused by Ford's pride. When said brother is kidnapped by an evil wizard intending to eat his brains, Stan considers letting the wizard take a few bites if it means the two of them becoming mental equals.

Rick tells Unity not to waste its time on Morty and Summer, comparing them to the species Unity takes over the minds of, saying that "they put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful, and because THEY put you there, they want you to be less powerful." This is often interpreted as a running theme of the show, with Rick's intelligence often alienating him from other people and making them not want anything to do with him. It's also deconstructed, as it's made pretty clear that Rick is alienated from others not necessarily because of his intelligence, but because of his bullying and condescending attitude towards pretty much everyone and frequently attempting to use his intelligence to justify that attitude. Rick wants to connect with other people, mainly his family, yet he can't reconcile his basic human instincts of connection with others with his vast intelligence, awareness of the interchangability of all sentient beings across the multiverse and the apparent pointlessness of anything anyone does. It's what causes him to view his attachments to others as one of his flaws.

<ul><li> In East Asian cultures, this kind of mentality often isn't opposed, precisely because of this.
</li><li> The Kung bushmen enforce this in their own tribes through a practice called "insulting the meat". For example, if a hunter were to get a sizable kill, and bring it back to camp boasting about it, the other tribal members would insult it, claiming it was worthless. When an anthropologist found this out the hard way, an elder explained to him that it was done in order to prevent a skilled tribal member from walking around like he owned the tribe, which would lead to trouble.
</li><li> The origin of this trope may be that humans have a great sense for when outcomes are unequal, which doesn't mean the outcome is unfair. This is coupled with a sense of indignation when we're on the short end of the stick.
<ul><li> In one of the early experiments on game theory at RAND, two scientists were asked to play an iterated prisoner's dilemma game against "the bank" (ie: they could simply win money from a third party). However, the pay-off matrix was purposefully imbalanced so the best player A could do was win a sum ($5 USD, which went a lot further back then) by allowing player B to win twice as much. Rather than maximize his own profits by cooperating, he kept tanking them both because he felt the game was unfair, defecting about 30% of the time. Player A really has no reason to screw player B, since a third party made up the game and recruited them to play it.
</li><li> In another experiment, two participants play a game called Ultimatum. They flip a coin, and both are offered a sum of money by a third party. The winner of the coin flip can offer any amount to the loser, but the loser of the flip must approve the deal or neither gets any money. It's rational for the loser to accept any deal that gives them something, but a deal usually can't get much worse than 60-40 before most participants wind up rejecting it. Most players who win the coin toss also intuit this, and while they take a majority of the money, they give a substantial portion to the loser. Contrast this with Dictator, where the winner simply divides the money and keeps as much as they want, while the loser has no choice in the matter. The Dictator rarely gives away much of their windfall.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is a plant, but actual plants like poppies and trees have evolved the way they did because of an aversion. When there's a tall tree, it casts a shadow over the shorter plants near it, so that they don't get as much sunlight. A short tree would be best off if it didn't have to build a longer stem (so long and thick that it's worthy of the name "trunk") to catch up, so it would benefit if it could either cut off the tall tree or talk to it and convince it, saying "Hey, let's all take it easy and be short." Then no tree would have to put all its resources into a giant trunk. But those things can't happen, so the only outcome is that these plants can't survive if they are too much shorter than the average height for their neighbors.
</li><li> Many of the basic rules of basketball - the shot clock, goaltending, three-point shots, and the width of the lane - were introduced to minimize the impact of big men.
</li><li> One of Communism's most prevalent criticisms is that it results in this mentality. It is an ideology that is dedicated to complete egalitarianism by way of abolishing class systems as well as money - however the result is that it kills incentives to work hard or for those who are talented to make use of their individual skills. In a system where a doctor is basically paid the same and/or in the same social strata as as a janitor (or isn't paid at all), the less people will be motivated to become doctors, or if in the profession, perform at their best. Communist regimes such as the USSR compensate for low performance brought by this trope, by way of mass-mobilisation events and specific type of propaganda, ironically creating a race environment: people are tasked with overcoming quotas and records set by previous "winner", with titles like "leader of the work" and further incentives related to it. Most of the "prizes" are usually purely symbolic, rather than any sort of privileges. And while part of it is always done for propaganda and part by people opportunistically gaming of the system, a large sections of population always ends up reacting with genuine enthusiasm. The whole gig works for as long as the "race" or "fight" mobilisation are kept alive and people genuinely try to participate in it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wuz5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wuz5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wuz5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was most notably used in the direct post-war years in all the Eastern Block for the sake of the post-war reconstruction, particularly in the most iconic "fight for homes", where brick-laying teams were competing on national, and even international scale about who will set the new record of as many bricks laid down within a single shift as only possible. Contrary to the believe, this was a professional job done by trained specialists, but with application of converter belt efficiency to it, leading to situations where people could finish tenement buildings within a month using nothing but most basic tools and they still stand strong to this day</span>.
