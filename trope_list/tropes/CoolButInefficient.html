Sometimes its shoddiness serves to add drama to the plot; at other times, the only reason for it being there is to look cool and futuristic.
</p><p>This is not in the least helped by a tendency not to do the research; futuristic rayguns also tend to lack some of the most common-sense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">niceties of modern firearms.</a> The most frequent mistake is the lack of a trigger guard, anything vaguely resembling sights, a shoulder stock, or anything else to give you an edge over just firing from the hip, or indeed a rate of fire better than a flintlock.
</p><p>Sci-fi spacecraft, in general, heavily tend to fall into this trope. Wings, fins, streamlined designs, and pointless projections stud the outside of spacecraft never intended to enter an atmosphere. Most modern portrayals are savvy enough to at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> streamlined spacecraft. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> leaves gaping voids in the middle of their spaceships, but in-universe, this is because the warp fields generated by the nacelles necessitate them being kept at some distance to the rest of the ship. Likewise, the Alliance ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> look nice because of their vertical ship alignment, but the placement of the engines is to keep the ships from ripping themselves apart every time they accelerate. Alternately, one could build along the lines of the <em>Discovery</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>, but even its comparatively utilitarian shape doesn't account for gigantic radiator fins to bleed off heat from its gas-core nuclear reactor/main engine.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02l2a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02l2a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02l2a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>, there <em>were</em> going to be fins, but the production crew didn't want to keep answering questions along the lines of "How is it supposed to fly in space?" from the public.</span>

</li><li> Lampshaded in episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, wherein a character points out that an ordinary nuclear-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> with conventional weapons is a much more practical solution to the Angel threat than using genetically engineered cyborg monsters piloted by mentally ill children and powered by the souls of the pilots' dead mothers. The only reason why the latter is used instead of the former is because conventional weapons cannot penetrate the Angels' AT fields, whereas mentally ill children and the souls of their dead mothers <em>can</em>.
</li><li> Discussed quite a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KeepYourHandsOffEizouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KeepYourHandsOffEizouken">Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</a></em>, where the Film Club are commissioned by the Robot Club to do a short film about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> battle. The leader of the Robot Club is a big-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre">Real Robot Genre</a> purist, and tries to take pains to make the film as realistic as possible (to inspire people in real life to build giant robots), but when realism ends up on the table, the Film Club start nitpicking the idea because the phrase "realistic mecha" is kind of a contradiction in terms. After all, a humanoid robot isn't very stable or agile once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">scaled up to the point where it can carry a pilot</a>, and it can't carry very heavy weapons or armor, and it's really tall, which makes it an easy target—and even if a technologically-advanced culture did manage to solve all those problems, they could probably do a much better job throwing the resources needed to make a combat robot usable into making tried-and-tested vehicles like tanks even better. This causes the head of the Club to have a small breakdown, admitting that he knows his dream of combat-ready mecha will probably never come true, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">being a giant robot pilot is his lifelong dream</a>, so he wants to persist in the idea even if he knows it'll never come true.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RemoTheDestroyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RemoTheDestroyer">Remo The Destroyer</a></em> comic featured at one point (in the hands of the bad guy) a prototype gun, intended by the manufacturers to be a standardized field weapon, that fired a <em>nuclear</em> explosive. Blast radius? 5000 meters. Range of a shot? 1800 meters... maybe... with the wind in the right direction. Suffice to say, it didn't sell.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em>, magical artifacts native to the Homelands are capable of powerful and varied effects such as the Vorpal Sword being able to cut through anything or the Mirror on the Wall being the perfect spying device while on the same plane. However they cannot be mass produced and mundane weaponry is a serious threat to the Adversary's regime. The Adversary is well aware that mundane technology is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> by comparison, but eschewed it because allowing the spread of technology that could allow a peasant to kill a mage would have been all but inviting massive rebellion.
</li><li> One of the stormtroopers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre">Twisted Toyfare Theatre</a></em> built a three sided lightsaber. He ended up accidentally cutting his own hand.

</li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> involves the idea that superheroes are this. Pretty much every time we actually see any of the characters busting criminals, they're shown to do that job very well... but as Dan points out in retrospect of his own career, you don't need an individual with years of martial arts training and expensive gadgetry to break up mob rings or catch purse-snatchers when a moderately funded police force can do the same dang thing. In a world where there aren't equally grandiose supervillains, a superhero is just a waste of talent and resources. The only superheroes shown to accomplish anything particularly meaningful are the ones to abandon crimefighting altogether in favor of government or corporate work.

Unlike later models, Glasgows are fragile enough that an rpg can take one out and have such poor performance that Kallen, one of the best pilots in the world, struggles against average pilots in Sutherlands. As a result, when the Black Knights get a shipment of them, Zero strips them down to their cockpits and repurposes them as training simulators until his own Knightmares are completed.

Against an armored opponent you're better off using a club or axe which can injure them without having to target weak points. In open warfare, most uses spears or polearms which have far greater reach than a sword. In his words, people just like using swords because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords">Heroes Prefer Swords</a>.

<ul><li> It perpetrates the same problems as <em>Trek</em> when it comes to force fields, like with forcefields replacing regular <em>spacedoors</em>. In this case, power failure would lead to explosive decompression of all landing bays. However, as <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> shows, there are typically emergency metal doors that quickly close in the event of such a power failure.
</li><li> Perhaps the most garish example of Cool, but Inefficient technology is the Buzz Droid Missile in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>. A missile is deployed which tracks its target, <em>flies ahead of the target</em> and then explodes to disperse small droids which then must attempt to tear apart an enemy starfighter <em>from the outside in</em>. Exactly how this is more efficient than simply packing the missile with high explosive and <em>letting it hit the target first</em> is not explained. While useful if you're trying to capture the target, they were not. Supplemental stories suggest that buzz droids are meant for use against larger capital ships or for setting up impassable areas, suggesting their use in that encounter was a desperation move, which makes a little more sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>: As a giant <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank">Walking Tank</a></em> with four long legs, the AT-AT Walkers have two things going for them; they have extremely good terrain-crossing capabilities and they are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation">goddamn terrifying</a></em> if you're an infantryman watching them advance on your position. But they're slow (easily being outrun by tiny snowspeeders), have no maneuverability, and are vulnerable to attacks to the legs. There's also the fact that <em>every single weapon</em> on an AT-AT is attached to the head, and none of them are mounted in a way that allows them to hit anything that isn't directly in front of the cockpit.
<ul><li> To be fair, the reason AT-ATs are so slow is they're covered head to toe with heavy armor, and it was <em>very</em> effective at tanking anything the Rebels threw at it. The harpoon/tow rope trick that Rogue Squadron used to take one down was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">highly unconventional</a>, and it only worked once since the Imperials began shooting down any Speeder that made a go for the legs. Still an impractical machine though.
</li></ul></li><li> The lightsaber, which, while lethally effective, suffers the same drawback that rendered metallic swords obsolete when firearms came along: its maximum effective range is one yard plus the length of your arm. It <em>is</em> more effective in the hands of the people that favor them, considering their extreme reflexes and their ability to reflect your shots back at you... but only because their enemies are using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Frickin' Laser Beams</a> instead of bullets despite knowing they can be reflected.
</li><li> The Doublesided Lightsaber, which despite being more powerful and giving more slaughter-per-swing, is utilised by very few Jedi and Sith due to how insanely difficult it is to master. Without extensive training how to wield it, it's more likely the person using it will accidentally kill <em>themselves</em> rather than their enemies, by either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impaling</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">bisecting themselves</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> once included a passing mention of a lightsabre that could suddenly double the length of the blade at the flick of a switch, which has similar problems, on top of which tended to lose power at inopportune moments.

However, to do so, it has to drain another star to have the required power to do so, which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">incredibly slow process</a>, on top of which, it's stupidly expensive and manpower intensive. And it still has the same weakness as the original Death Star, albeit better armoured. Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>, where it's noted that whole thing was a massive waste of resources.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>, the standard-issue Morita assault rifle of the Mobile Infantry features an underslung pump shotgun and fires a hefty round that can punch through two inches of solid titanium and blow an Arachnid's limb clean off with one shot. However because of the ridiculously overpowered round, troopers shoot like graduates of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy</a> when firing on full-auto (which they need to do as Arachnids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">Feel No Pain</a> and will keep fighting no matter how badly hurt they are) and worse, the guns seem to even lack basic iron sights.
<ul><li> Made more glaring as unit leaders like Rasczak use a carbine version that removes the shotgun and has sights, and looks much lighter and easier to wield to boot. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the trend in modern military rifle development across all nations is towards shortening the weapon, reducing weight and improving mobility and handling (the military thinking says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">sheer volume of fire</a> is nearly always what wins the day rather than range or stopping power, and a lighter rifle offsets overall carry weight when ammunition, armour and other equipment is thrown in). It raises the question why all soldiers are not equipped with the carbine variant.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan">Demolition Man</a></em>, the plasma gun used by Simon Phoenix is a subversion. At first it takes minutes to recharge; Simon uses it anyway, because he likes to see things blow up. However, this was because it had been in storage in a museum and had to reachieve fusion first. Once it had recharged itself it was firing plasma bolts as fast as a pump-action shotgun would be firing slugs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland">The Island</a></em> featured weapons that fired barbed hooks, like a taser, used to stop escaped clones. Except the hooks were bigger and looked more painful, and the thing didn't give an electric charge to subdue the struggling victim, now in horrible pain from having two huge anchors shot into his skin.

<ul><li> Acknowledged with the ED-209. The OCP Vice President Dick Jones mentions that he doesn't care whether or not ED-209 works, rather that it is marketable enough to be purchased by the military, and that OCP has an exclusive contract on repairs and spare parts. ED-209, while deadly, is extremely faulty; it is unable to distinguish a surrendering "hostile" (really an OCP employee in a demonstration), thus brutally killing the man, its arm cannons can swivel enough to blast each other off, its large feet and digitigrade legs render it unable to maneuver down stairs, it has a big vulnerable air intake at its front, and both of its hands are guns, rendering it incapable of doing something as simple as putting handcuffs on a criminal. Designer Craig Davis claims he intentionally designed ED-209 to make it look like its fictional designers were more concerned about making it look cool than making it work well— "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">just like an American car</a>". The second film shows that when it was adopted, it had numerous issues, with one of the news clips showing it trapped by an open manhole. In the third film, it's easily reprogrammed by a <em>child with a laptop</em>.
</li><li> The 6000-SUX car is top of the list when a small time criminal demands a new car which has reclining leather seats, goes really fast and gets really shitty gas mileage. The commercial for the 6000 SUX specifically notes - 8.2 mpg!

Of the 75 children conscripted, 30 were killed during the augmentation process and 12 were severely crippled.

Nonetheless, their exceptional effectiveness in ground ops is the <em>only</em> real edge the UNSC has for much of the war, but there are just too few of them to go around.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Potter Verse</a>, the wizards tend to insist on doing everything by old-fashioned means and by magic, even though modern technology would often work better even than the magic.
<ul><li> Given the relative ease with which wizardly means of communication (owls, fireplaces) can be tampered with, it's astonishing that they don't just use telephones and email. Eventually the series does attempt to justify this through a combination of claiming that large amounts of magic will interfere with electronics and that enchanting technology that's too modern makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> breaches far more likely, but still... And owls for communication, how can that be anything but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Rowling has explicitly stated</a> in an interview that the reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> is more or less that a muggle with a shotgun will beat a wizard with a wand almost every time. Which is also explored in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=080425">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> parody.
</li><li> Most of the magic-using folk are shown to be highly ignorant of the modern world. Magic has allowed their culture to stagnate at a far less-modern level; they haven't modernized because they haven't needed to. A lot of them pity people who don't live as they do — leading to a broad spectrum of opinions ranging from 'ahh, bless!' to 'do what you like with them — they are inferior'. Even Voldemort does not concern himself with 'Muggles' (they even have a derogatory word! How very White Wolf of them), just the domination of the magical community.
</li><li> On the other hand, the series explicitly takes place in the 1990s (between 1991 and 1998, to be exact). Back then, phones were the size of tablets, computers couldn't do even <em>one tenth</em> of the things they can do now, there was no Facebook, no Twitter, you needed a modem to access what little existed of the Internet... But the worst part was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">computers still used floppy disks</a>. If you don't know what that is, look it up. In that light, the lack of technology is not so surprising.
</li></ul></li><li> That is defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> — and getting muggles involved is something akin to nuclear strike in the supernatural community, and has been even back when humans waved <em>torches and pitchforks</em> around. Now, with powerful weapons, broad communications and mobilization, and fast, effective, heavy-duty transport, humans are a force to be reckoned with. A lot of technology will fail in the presence of powerful magic, but a bullet can kill a wizard or a gibbering monster just as easily as a ball of fire. (In the case of said monsters, sometimes <em>many</em> bullets.)
<ul><li> More directly, sparks and other special effects are a sign of inefficiency in handling magic. Harry remarks that, while his damaged-focus-based shield dripping sparks could look a little cool and his staff dripping <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hellfire</span> could look pretty impressive, all of the supernatural crowd knows that to be a sign of poor form.

<ul><li> Lampshaded when an angry veteran of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">zombie war</a> blames the loss of the Battle of Yonkers partly on the flashy, high-tech weapons used: Incendiary weapons and shrapnel were far less useful against zombies who could only be killed if their brain was destroyed. This is then subverted later on, where a number of energy weapons become the subjects of propaganda films which boost the morale of the surviving humans. Though they have no strategic value, they make a huge psychological difference.
</li><li> The most effective weapon in the war turns out to be "The Lobotomizer"—a cross between an entrenching tool and a battleaxe, invented by Marine infantrymen.
</li><li> One chapter mentions a kid on rollerblades, trying to fight zombies with a meat cleaver on a hockey stick. It probably looked very cool in his imagination. The actual fight didn't work out quite as well.
</li><li> The <em>Zombie Survival Guide</em> cautions against many of the more photogenic resorts. Motorcycles, cars, and guns are noisy; flamethrowers and machine guns are designed to combat targets that stop moving when their muscles are destroyed; Kevlar vests only cover the torso; and so on. It's interesting to read that the person with the greatest chance of surviving is an unarmored man on a bicycle with a crossbow and crowbar.

Unfortunately, they are rushed into production before the bugs are worked out, and the resulting fiascoes more than cancel out the military benefits. The last straw comes when a device to stretch space around a ship (putting it far away from the rest of the universe, thus making it invisible and untouchable until the device is switched off) turns out to subtly distort everything on board, to the point where the fleet's parts are no longer interchangeable.

It has no giveaway flash like a laser, it's a lot harder to patch a holed suit when there's an arrow sticking out of it, and the recoil sends the archer moving backwards after a shot, out of line of retaliatory fire.

</li><li> In the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a> novels a weapon is introduced that can bring down an enemy ships shields, which would be an in universe game-breaker, if its range wasn't so absurdly short that you're considered to be in 'point blank' energy range at roughly four times its firing range. And that doesn't even factor in the missiles which have orders of magnitude more range anyway.
<ul><li> She then proceeds to win an impossibly unbalanced fight with it. However, that is less because of the weapon than because it's Honor, who would really have preferred a full missile broadside instead, and she is quite annoyed when the developer attempts to use this event in their favor.
</li><li> It is later revealed that the person who ordered Honor's ship outfitted with these weapons never expected it to be used in an independant deployment, and that the ship was just the testbed for using it as part of combined-arms tactics.

</li><li> A very literal interpretation in the <em>Enchanted Forest Chronicles</em> is the use of magic by wizards. Any lights or smoke that is not being used to produce the intended effect is excess magic that's being wasted. The more amazing and flashy their magic is, the less <em>efficient</em> it is, and thus the weaker their spells are. The deadliest wizards don't whirl away in a twinkling of light; they simply disappear.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>'s got examples by the ton:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode centers around a firearm Starfleet was planning to use when their phasers wouldn't work. The weapon was quite versatile: The person using it could not be found by normal means, and it was modified with a microtransporter so that it could <em>shoot through walls</em>. Even though the gun was shown to be incredibly efficient, they found a way around the phaser problem, so all work on it was dropped.
</li><li> Another episode included Major Kira explaining why the Bajoran Resistance wasn't interested in Federation-made phaser rifles, instead opting for the Cardasian disruptor rifle. While the phaser rifle has all kinds of cool, neat gadgets and add-on features, in the field (when you don't have proper maintenance facilities and spare parts and the like) that's just more things to go wrong with it. A Cardasian disruptor rifle only has stun and kill settings, but you can lean it against a tree and leave it for ten years and it'll still work without trouble.
</li><li> They introduced a holographic communicator (and extension of holodeck technology) to replace the viewscreen communicators, which sounds cool until you realize it needed a special podium retrofitted to send and receive from and having a person just blink into existence on the bridge or ready room gave everyone including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadAss">Sisko</a> a serious case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> creeps. It was quietly dropped as even the viewer could see that it offered no improvement over the viewscreens already in use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has also shown that forcefields are the primary means of keeping prisoners in their cells. There's no indication that a solid door wouldn't work just as well and there's no reason they couldn't use both forcefields <em>and</em> physical doors, like shuttle bays do. This is so prevalent an objection that the novel Spock's World revealed that prisons on Vulcan had no doors, being only accessible via transporter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em> also features at least one Forcefield Window, though wisely covered with a shutter when not in use.
</li><li> The Federation is not alone in this. The Romulans strongly favor a "warbird" motif in their starship design (their ancestors were dissident warrior Vulcans known as "Those who march beneath the raptor's wings"). Thus their <em>D'deridex</em> and <em>Valdore</em> class warbirds are actually larger than even Starfleet's <em>Galaxy</em> class. But much of that size is taken up by "wings" which are not needed in space and seemingly serve a purely aesthetic purpose. In terms of speed they are actually a bit slower than comparable Federation starships. They also tend to place an emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon">Fixed Forward-Facing Weapon</a> emplacements, rather than following Starfleet's adoption of phaser arrays which can fire in virtually any direction for which they have line-of-sight.
</li><li> Phaser holster design. In the modern world, our holsters are ergonomically designed, with all manner of flaps and clips to keep the weapon as snug, safe and easy to draw as possible. The phasers on the first series of The Next Generation however resemble handheld vacuum cleaners and as such their holsters can be charitably described as a <em>slot</em>. In Star Trek Nemesis, even though the weapon is vastly smaller and neater than this version, the holster has barely changed and a <em>light tumble</em> across the bridge on Picard's part causes him to lose the weapon without his knowledge and nearly gets him killed when his rifle breaks. It is no exaggeration to say that we were using better equipment in the 18th century than the Federation is using in the 24th.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:

Eventually, we're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">explicitly told</a> that they're created for terror, not for efficiency; humans find firearms (or zat guns) more useful. One episode even features a demonstration for the benefit of rebel Jaffa. The best marksman there manages to hit a stationary target two out of three times, resulting in a couple burn marks. Major Carter, on the other hand, is able to <em>cut the log in half</em> with a couple bursts from her P90 at the same range — then cut the rope holding it up with a single bullet.
</li><li> There's an impractical prison that works by shifting the gravity horizontally and turning a long room into a deep pit. It has no door, fails during a power outage and could be escaped from by having a friend lower you a rope. But, dammit, it looks so <em>cool</em>!
</li><li> The Goa'uld also use force fields instead of glass for windows on their spacecraft, which they attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> as being necessary because glass would not hold up under the strain. Glass would at least <em>try</em>, unlike a force field in a power failure.

McKay comments that flying that fast is a <em>really</em> impressive feat... but also not very useful in a universe where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL Travel</a> exists, as demonstrated by the fact that it took them 10,000 years just to get outside their starting galaxy (then again, it is eventually explained that the ship's FTL wasn't working, so they gunned the engines as hard as they could... not that it really helped them).

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">advantage of making a hologram of something that's supposed to be transparent</a>, though...
</li><li> In a later episode there's a holographic set of pool balls which seem to be slightly less reliable than a real set.

</li><li> Laser guns apparently. One villain shows up with a fancy laser pistol that he uses to some effect, then it runs out of power partway through a fairly short fight. It's probably worth noting that neither most independent citizens nor Alliance soldiers bother with hand-held laser weapons, and this character was established as a rich idiot who liked to show off.

The choice of starship weaponry drew particular attention for its freshness and originality: it uses machine guns.
</li><li> Played straight with the cornerless paper. Sure, it looks cool, but how do you store large quantities? On Earth, we put our cornered paper in rolls, what do they do? Although this might be more <em>Alien but Inefficient</em>. (Ron Moore stated in an interview that after several seasons of having to cut corners off every single sheet of paper shown in the series, which is a lot considering the ship can't use computers, he was ready to murder the art director who came up with the idea for the miniseries.)
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> episode "Terror From the Year 5000": The Observers tell Mike that they've evolved beyond food, and get all their nutritional requirements from a tiny pill.

<ul><li> They also have become disembodied brains with no need for bodies... and will stubbornly assert this even when their bodies are standing there, holding their brains in trays (because their brains can't move about on their own, predictably) as well as talk and do everything else a normal person would. And of course having the brain physically separated from the rest of you invites yet another obvious risk, as happens when Professor Bobo mistakes one for sandwich meat...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, the title Doctor is joined by the ex-time Agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Captain Jack Harkness</a> who proceeds to show off his cool sonic gun which can even blow exactly square-shaped holes into whatever blocks its path, which impresses Rose, much to the Doctor's disdain. Ironically, its many extras make the gun run out of energy in a crucial moment, leaving the Doctor and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">sonic screwdriver</a> to save the day.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlakesSevenS2E3Weapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlakesSevenS2E3Weapon">Weapon</a>" had a weapon called the IMIPAK (Incipient Molecular Instability Projector And Key), a ray gun which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">induced incipient instability in the molecular structure of the target</a>, after which you have to whip out and activate the Key to convert it to actual instability and thus destroy the target — except that if the target is a living being and noticed you firing the gun at him, you never get the chance because long before then, he's zapped you with his own less acronymic but far more practical weapon. It makes an <em>excellent</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">Explosive Leash</a>, but as a sniper weapon it leaves much to be desired.
</li><li> Some of the myths tested by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> result in builds which fall into this category (those builds that don't qualify for this trope <em>usually</em> fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>). One of the best-known examples is the Lead Balloon—sure, you can build a balloon out of lead foil and have it float, but aluminum foil is stronger, lighter, safer to work with, and easier to get a hold of.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, the murder of a lottery winner leads the detectives to have a conversation about what they'd buy if they won the lottery, during which Detective Esposito says he'd buy a Ferrari. Castle, a millionaire mystery writer, points out that he has one, and it's not as great as you'd think. When Esposito insists that they're "hella fast", Castle points out that in rush hour traffic it's just as fast as any other car. Esposito and Ryan — not being millionaires — still frequently badgers and barters with Castle to get a turn driving the car <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">at every possible opportunity</a>.
</li><li> The PPGs (Phased Plasma Guns) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> look cool especially when firing, but lack trigger guards, don't appear particularly accurate, and emit an audible whine when powering up (eliminating any possibility of stealthy approach). Indeed, several characters are alerted to an ambush over the course of the series by hearing the power-up whine. Hand weapons such as the Minbari pike or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> are generally more effective at catching people unawares. However, the weapon does have some practical use in that it can do a lot of damage to organic targets and can be set to cut through reinforced doors, but its standard setting won't risk punching through the hull, unlike conventional bullets. Bullets are stated to be still be in use, but it's mainly private citizens and the occasional security force that live and operate planetside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983">V (1983)</a></em>: The state of the art laser weaponry carried by the aliens in the original miniseries simply does not work. Throughout the course of the show we see people hit in the heart, the back, the side, the arm and the leg; and with the exception of a fairly impressive pyrotechnic display on impact, the only result is a grizzly looking but nonetheless unimpressive little flesh wound that often fails to even slow the target down let alone kill them. Fans have tried to hand wave this as being some kind of never before mentioned stun setting, unfortunately if that were true it would qualify as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plot</a> as even during the final battle when the aliens are clearly attempting to murder the humans their weapons are still useless. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the bows used by Alexander the Great three thousand years ago had more stopping power, had more range judging by the firing distances employed, and fired projectiles that were significantly faster as the laser bolts are laughably slow compared to arrows or bullets.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911">Reno 911!</a></em> has the department blow unspent case settlement money on a kickass new Hummer for the department. It's honestly worse than the standard cars they use but it's still a police Hummer.

<ul><li> It's in love with this trope, although it has some spectacular cases of boring but practical as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic">Huge spaceships made to look like cathedrals</a>?

Armies made up of 95% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> and a few good units and vehicles? Hordes of unarmed civilians supported by about 6 daemons? Oh boy, do we ever got them. Some armies even go as far as to make up reasons why these things have to be like this. For instance, the Chaos Marines (badass evil army whose cannon fodder is capable of withstanding a black hole) Codex explains that they only have weird symbols on walls and sharpened teeth because they feel cooler when they do. Also, asking them WHY they are evil is answered with "why not?" The Imperium of Man, meanwhile (they of the giant cathedral spaceships), lost all knowledge of why their technology works so long ago that a religion has built up to fill the void. They go and make everything super-ornate to please the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Machine Spirit</a>" who animates their technology and think that if they lay off the pomp, everything will break.
</li><li> The standard sidearm for military officers of the Imperium is the Bolt Pistol. It fires .75 caliber depleted-uranium rocket-propelled grenade rounds instead of bullets. Space Marines use the same gun but in the form of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">sub-machine gun</a></em>.
<ul><li> Note also that Bolt rounds are generally designed to penetrate armor and detonate <em>inside</em> the target, doing incredible damage to single targets, rather than being airburst munitions. Still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">bolters are in use for a reason</a>; Space Marines have high-quality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> that takes an armor-penetrating bullet to crack, but also have highly redundant organ systems that give them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Super Toughness</a>, so any bullet that does end up in their skin needs to do some serious damage to have any noticeable effect—one which merely goes in one side and out the other would at best stagger a Space Marine. They're still inefficient, though, given that standard laser weaponry can overwhelm the same armor's capabilities with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">sheer volume of fire</a>, and each laser blast is basically free, while each bolt round takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">painstaking labor and expensive materials to create</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Larger weapons in <em>40K</em> tend to take this to ridiculous extremes, as do alien weapons. The assault cannon is more or less an armor-piercing rocket-launching minigun, Necron gauss weapons strip the target's molecules away layer by layer, allowing them to punch through the heaviest armor as well as grant them the name "gauss flayers", chainsaw swords are ubiquitous among Imperium forces from longsword varieties to types longer than their wielder is tall, the larger Imperium vehicles don't so much fire a cannon as they do a broadside, and then there's the Shokk Attack Gun (an ork weapon that sends a tiny goblin in a tunnel through hell, the other end of the tunnel being inside an enemy tank or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>-wearing soldier, and can backfire in many highly amusing ways)...

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> universe has a long and intricate history that attempts to justify why they bother at all with giant robots instead of conventional combat vehicles - in this case it's because of the flexibility of a humanoid form, and the durability of their modular design. They're regularly used in civilian work as well, so there isn't a shortage of competent pilots. The old Star League got past this trope and ended up nuking themselves back to the to the point where three centuries later much of their most advanced achievements still haven't been rediscovered, so most 31st century combat is deliberately kept like this to limit collateral damage. The rare incidences where nukes show up demonstrate why this is a good thing.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The splatbook <em>Complete Arcane</em> introduced the Warlock, a spellcaster with the ability to fire an "Eldritch Blast" from their hands at will, as well as use a small set of "Invocations", which were spell-like abilities with no restriction of use. One of these Invocations was "Hideous Blow", which allows you to make a single melee attack and add the damage from your Eldritch Blast to the damage roll. Eldritch Blast has the distinct advantages of being a 60' ranged touch attack, meaning that you can attack from a good distance and ignore most kinds of armor bonuses the target may have; both of these were lost when you used Hideous Blow. In addition, Warlocks are charisma-based casters, meaning they don't prioritize a high strength or fighter-style feats to let them actually be good fighters. The result was that Hideous Blow was much harder to score a hit with, and only doing a little extra damage, compared to just using Eldritch Blast (and saving that Invocation slot for something actually useful). When a later book added the Eldritch Glaive (a melee-attack Invocation that actually was useful), the number of HB-using players dropped from "very few" to "none".
</li><li> The first attempt at adding early firearms in the game resulted in a musket and a pistol that were barely better than crossbows in terms of damage and range, were classified as exotic weapons and had ludicrously expensive ammunition. Crossbows were already pretty unpopular anyway since the only way to get a viable ranged character was with feats to spray enemies with arrows and only bows and repeating crossbows (the latter being exotic weapons) allow it.
</li><li> In 3rd/3.5 edition, the Monkey Grip feat was infamously one of these. It allowed the user to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander">use a two-handed weapon as a one-handed weapon</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">use a two-handed weapon from a creature one category size larger as normal</a>, albeit either use gave a penalty to hit. Sure, it's cool to be swinging a sword around larger than yourself, but the extra damage is more than offset by the penalty to hit (good old Power Attack provides better scaling), and the reach rules, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>, made it so that you only had your normal reach even when using them. There are only two edge cases where it works - one involves a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> interpretation on how polearms work (and can be held in check by narrow passages), and the other is only for creatures that are already categorized as Huge (<em>i.e.</em>, over 16 feet tall) or larger in the game (none of which are listed as viable options for player characters, so only really suitable for foes).
</li><li> In 5e, there is the Purple Dragon Knight. Supposedly, it's able to empower its allies to such an extent, they can turn even an ordinary militia into a force to be reckoned with. In practice however, it's not that great. Most of its special abilities are tied into that of the base Fighter class. It can help to heal its allies, but only when it's healing itself. It can get its allies to make a reaction attack, when it uses its Action Surge. It can help its allies reroll a failed Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, but only if it failed the throw themselves. That being said, it does get proficiency in Persuasion (normally, not a Fighter-based skill), or another skill if they are already proficient with it, and get a double Proficiency Bonus for Persuasion, meaning that they can be a good Party Face. Overall though, it's not really popular.

Even at that point in the game, there existed equip spells like United We Stand, Mage Power, or Axe of Despair that could buff up a weak monster to similar scales for nowhere near as much work, making such big bosses unusable even in decks looking for big numbers. Later boss monsters tended to have actual abilities along with high stats, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> (or, occasionally, just flat-out good).

Essentially, certain batches of metallic plastic from 1989-1998, usually used in big, impressive toys, tended to degrade over time and fracture with ease. The end result? <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Image:G2_Electro_toy.jpg">Pretty-looking, shiny toys<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Image:Electrogoldplasticsyndrome.jpg">that would shatter while being taken out of the box.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>

This managed to sour consumer relationship with so many sets afterwards (not to mention it seemed like the problem migrated to just about every type of joints regardless of color) that Lego had to completely drop the old ball-socket system for a new design. It didn't help that some of the most popular sets during this time were lime-green (especially the limited edition Lesovikk).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders</a> 2</em>, the Vector Cannon was the coolest weapon in the game. Unfortunately, outside of a few isolated instances (destroying the battleship engines, the shield around Aumaan and as a spectacular ending to the final Anubis fight if your aim was good), the weapon was practically useless due to its long recharge time, the requisite that your mech's legs be touching the ground or another stable surface during the charging, and the inordinate amount of subweapon energy consumed by firing (though the latter was negated if you played as Naked Jehuty, which had infinite subweapon energy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> had the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> Meteor which inflicts an impressive 9999 damage to all targets and ignores shell and reflect status, but requires a costly 99 MP to use and takes almost three times as long to cast as your high-tier elemental spells like Firaga (Fire 3). There are very few times where you're not better off using faster and far less costly spells in battles, such as Quake for crowds (casts in a tenth of the time) or Flare (Nuke) for a single target (Casts in under half the time), not to mention the only end-game character with access to the spell is Rydia who has an entire arsenal of summons which tend to be more practical.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> gives you The Treaty-Blade and The Sword of Kings. These swords have the power to cut <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Nethicite</a>, but, more importantly, have been bequeathed by the Gods themselves. Naturally, these swords'll be amazing, right? Wrong. They each have 30 attack. To give you an idea, the maximum attack a weapon can have is 150 - the kind of weapon your fighters will have at the time will have between 50 and 70. Admittedly, the swords good for dodging, but other than that, it's there to look pretty.
</li><li> Hymir's Finger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> is a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> in a game which has done a good job of keeping the weapons relatively realistic, or as far as one can in a medieval-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">fantasy</a> world. It is long enough to qualify as a jousting lance, and it does a lot of damage, enough to mistake it for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. Cool, but it takes forever to swing. If you time your attacks right, you can wipe out whole squads of enemies, but the sword requires too much work to use properly. And the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is so much better.
</li><li> This was often cited as a weak point of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kinect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kinect">Kinect</a>: it was certainly cool to be able to control games with nothing but your own hands and body, but with very few exceptions (i.e. dance games), a primitive joystick push or button press would be infinitely more responsive and accurate.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> games feature dozens of neat little death effects caused by exotic weapons that use molecular inhibition fields, chemical catalysts, microwaves, and so on... but when you get down to it, you're better off with the automatic shotgun and the rocket launcher, if only because there's a lot more ammo. Also, unlike the exotic weapons, standard ballistic weapons such as the automatic shotgun or submachine gun did not completely destroy an enemy's body, meaning you could search them for items and ammo afterwards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> 4: Beyond the Sword</em>, the entry in the in-game encyclopedia for the assault mecha in the Next War official mod lampshades this, stating that the widespread use of the inefficient, unstable war machine instead of giant tanks is a result of its cool appearance, since awed politicians would be more likely to grant a budget to impressive-looking projects.
</li><li> Cool but inefficient describes all the Big Guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. Though they all have a higher damage rating, they either have a high spread or low rate of fire.
<ul><li> The Rock-It Launcher is the coolest of the bunch, and relatively efficient in that it can load any random junk and deal a hefty punch with it. It also suffers in that before a player can build one, they must first buy rather expensive plans. By the time most players have enough caps to make the purchase they have normally killed, looted and leveled enough that they now own more conventional weapons then they know what to do with.
<ul><li> The Rock-it Launcher becomes considerably more useful if you're playing with the Wanderers Edition mod installed. The whole basis of the mod is that combat is dangerous and resources scarce, ammo included. Junk certainly isn't, though, so all those formerly-useless tin cans, dinner plates and empty bottles laying around suddenly become a lifesaver when you're facing a horde of super mutants!
</li></ul></li><li> The Gatling laser is like a laser minigun and is nearly the highest damage weapon in the game. But it is incredibly inefficient due to rarity of ammo (you can buy ammo for it eventually which costs a lot), near inability to land critical hits (a one-shot critical on a target's head will usually kill it, even from a small weapon; and big guns have a painfully low critical hit chance), and the gun breaks down fairly quickly from extended use: Each shot reduces a weapon's condition which lowers its damage per shot. The Gatling laser has a blindingly fast rate of fire which also makes it deteriorate blindingly fast.
</li><li> The Alien Blaster is a unique weapon you can find that has an extremely high base damage and a 100% chance to land a critical hit with every shot. However it has an extremely limited ammo supply that cannot be replenished. Also, every shot will make it deteriorate by a sizable chunk until it becomes useless and the gun can only be repaired by NPCs which is expensive and very few NPCs can repair it up to 100% of its condition.
<ul><li> The Alien Blaster returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">New Vegas</a></em> when you choose "Wild Wasteland" as a trait. As such, you only get the blaster and whatever ammo you can scrounge up off the captain of the spaceship. Even when you can repair it with the perk "Jury Rigging", the lack of ammo severely limits its use. It's better to get the YCS/186 Gauss rifle due to being easier to repair and having ammo you can buy.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Experimental MIRV</a> is a missile launcher that fires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">8 mini-nukes</a> at once. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">you could get caught in the blast.</a> And the chances of actually <em>needing</em> to fire 8 mini-nukes in one shot are pretty low, if at all. The strongest in-game enemies can take around 2-3 mini nukes before going down, some of them like the Feral Ghoul Reaver can appear inside buildings or quickly close the gap between the player and them.
<ul><li> The standard variant, The Fat Man, is also this. Sure you can kill tough muties in a couple of hits, but the mini nukes are all hidden away across the entirety of the Capital Wasteland with only 70 in the main game and an extra 28 from all the DLC. The second problem is how it fires it's payload; it lobs them. Like a mortar cannon, it's difficult to aim over long distances and can't be fired indoors without blowing yourself up in the process. It's ultimately cheaper, if more difficult<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2irhe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2irhe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2irhe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These are the toughest monsters to kill in game, and only Behemoths can be called "boss" monsters</span>, to kill Behemoth and Overlord Super Mutants, Feral Ghoul Reavers, and Albino Radscorpions with conventional firearms.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> follows the proud traditions of its predecessors:
<ul><li> Most of the heavy weapons featured above in the Fallout 3 section return and with many of the same disadvantages. New ones however are:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Cryolator</a>. Its a cold version of the flamethrower (which tells you everything you need). However it uses fairly rare ammo and its ability to freeze enemies solid is unreliable at best. Can be upgraded to fire solid slugs of ice instead but these travel fairly slowly, making its almost impossible to hit far off or quick enemies.
</li><li> The Broadsider is a man portable circa 1700 navel cannon that shoots cannonballs. Very powerful, but slow to reload, uses ammo that can only be found in shops (apart from a handful you can find a specific locations) and its projectiles have a noticeable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery">arc</a>. Cannons are more volley weapons than direct fire but the fact that combat happens at close range only makes it more apparent that sitting for 210 years hasn't done it any favors.
</li><li> The minigun faces a new problem that makes it this trope: in addition to chewing through ammo like its going out of style, because of the way damage reduction is calculated it will deal half damage to most creatures you meet after about the first 5 hours or so, meaning it will take even more ammo to take things down. Explosive miniguns ease the ammo problem by dishing out more damage but there's a few problems: you have to get lucky and find it, you need a lot of ammo for it, and you need two very difficult to improve perks (Heavy Gunner to improve the bullet damage and Demolition Expert for stronger and bigger explosive blasts) which ultimately means you still have a heavy ammo hog that uses less bullets.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Power Armor</a> alternates between this and bordering into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. Unlike previous games Power Armour functions more like an actual suit of armor your character climbs into and pilots, and while it does turn you into a walking tank with incredibly high strength it also needs repairing, is expensive to upgrade (and become more expensive to repair once you have) and making sneaking much more difficult. It also requires the expensive to buy/hard to find Fusion Cores to run, which eventually run out of juice even with the max level of "Nuclear Physicist" making them last twice as long.
</li><li> The Gamma Gun fires concentrated radiation at its targets and kills them through increasing their rads, rather than dealing any damage to them. Against heavily armored humans this is exactly as lethal as it sounds. Unfortunately humans only make up a about 25% of all the enemies you will fight in the wasteland, and against everything else it either does nothing (in the case of <em>every single animal you meet</em> and Super Mutants) or actually <em>heals</em> them (in the case of ghouls, both sane and feral). Like all guns it also demands Perks to keep it usable (Nuclear Physicist and Gunslinger) which means it gets overshadowed by regular pistols as their ammo works on everything.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Krimzon Guard</a> Hellcat cruisers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em> easily qualify. On first sight, they're a flying tank, what's not to like? ...They're so large and slow they're nearly impossible to miss, they maneuver like a quadriplegic cow, their gun is no deadlier than that on the far nippier Guard speeder bike, and if you steal one, you'll piss off every Guard in the city. Just as an additional bonus, these annoyed Guard will come after you on speeders, crash into the back of your stolen Hellcat, and thoughtlessly explode, taking you down in an antigrav pileup... and if you're going along the ground, expect to have a dozen of these bikes hanging over your head raining fire while you try and fail to steer it around a corner without scratching the paintwork.
</li><li> Long polearms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em> fall under this trope. From horseback, lances are able to one-shot almost anyone with a couched charge, and in an open field, one can cleave down dozens of enemy soldiers with a halberd or bardiche. Of course, once a single infantryman gets in your face, you can't land any good blows because your huge polearm has just become a big clumsy stick. This echoes real life, as most long polearms are fairly worthless in close-quarters melee.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em> series has several weapons which are potentially more harmful to you than the enemy (Razorjack/Ripper, Biorifle), and a Gatling gun (Minigun) that depletes your ammo after a few seconds.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> games preceding <em>Symphony of the Night</em> often have a pocketwatch as one of the subweapons. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">stops most non-boss enemies from moving for a few seconds</a>, but almost any time it appears, it eats 5 hearts instead of 1 like the other subweapons do, except in <em>Haunted Castle</em> where it only consumes 2 hearts.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> series has the Gauss Rifle, an incredibly powerful weapon capable of killing nearly anything in one hit. On the downside of things, it has an incredibly low rate of fire, the ammunition is rarely found, and the few you can acquire are in such poor condition you only have a magazine or two worth of shots before it breaks.
<ul><li> <em>Clear Sky</em> dumbs it down even further by turning it into a prototype weapon that can only damage one specific enemy. Using it on the horde of fanatical mooks between you and him only gets you killed, very quickly.
</li><li> <em>Call of Pripyat</em> compensates by making the Rifle a genuine one of a kind weapon which you pry from a miniboss's dead hands. But you need to go through a rather lengthy series of sidequests in order to make it usable, and once you can use it, the repair cost alone is worth a couple high quality artifacts, and you only get 10 shots for the cost of another artifact. Even better, the damage is now low enough that certain mutants will usually survive more then a direct hit, and some special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> in the end-game level can take a round to the chest. When they attack in packs of 6 or more and you can only fire one round every 3 seconds, the Gauss Rifle starts to become a cool looking liability. Therefore, don't try using it as a close-quarters weapon. It does have the best handling of any sniper rifle, which can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoScope">surprisingly useful</a>, and it's by far the best choice for the only sniper mission in the game. It's still inferior to the VSS Vintorez and/or Dragunov SVD in most cases though, in terms of reliability and firing rate. The Gauss Rifle isn't terribly inefficient though: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mechanic at the wrecked ship in Zaton can give you six homemade batteries, at the steep price of 2000 rubles each</span>. This legitimately turns it into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> in the game, so the inefficiency argument is made moot. It actually gets <em>more</em> efficient on higher difficulties, due to the way the game handles difficulty settings. On the max difficulty, you can kill just about anything you want with a shot or two. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperPower">Unfortunately by the time you get it,</a> you'll probably have more weapons than you can reasonably use anyway.

Treats anything smaller than a Leader Hunter as a soccer ball. Now if only a single maxed Musclemass boosted Snap Kick would just send that annoying supersoldier to his death rather than having to go after him to repeat the process. In fact, most unlockable attacks qualify, as the majority of them are designed to do massive damage to a single target, when even basic attacks with the protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeBelowTheShoulder">Blade Below the Shoulder</a> can cleave through a tank without effort.

</li><li> <em>Dirge of Cerberus Final Fantasy VII</em> has the last level as Chaos. Chaos himself is very useful. All of his abilities are upgraded, and he uses the only weapon stronger than the Ultima Weapon. The thing is, the enemies are designed specifically to handle that weapon. That means, while your new melee combo is fancy, about twice as many hits in half as much time, and ends with a neat little mini-explosion, you're never going to hit anything with it. Even if you get close enough to try, you'll be pumped full of lasers, and the combo will be interrupted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a> 3</em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight">Laser Sight</a> attached to some of the weapons actually makes your aim actively worse. It may be realistic to have the laser jumping around when shooting, but still.
</li><li> <em>Tibia</em> has a tendency to introduce new gimmicky mechanics and then completely forget about them. A notable example, the enchanting system allows you sacrifice a gem to turn a weapon into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a> or a weapon of some other element. Sounds awesome until you learn that the enchantment doesn't actually net you any significant increase of DPS, has unnecessary class/level requirements, and only a very small list of weapons can be enchanted. On top of it, the game <em>discourages</em> you from wielding your new flaming spiky sword by making the enchantment wear off after a certain number of hits. After six years of regular patches, the system still hasn't received any attention from the developers, not even expanding the list of enchantable weapons. Players still only enchant their weapons to create cool decorations for their house.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Sonic</a>. Costing 100 Skill Points(Of 100) to equip and burning rings at a significantly higher rate than he does in his other appearances, this golden wonder ends up doing more harm than help. His special ability-an auto-pilot flying boost-ends up screwing you over or not being of much use do to how quickly it eats through even the largest stocks of rings and replacing the basic boost in all but a few areas, which absolutely neuters Super Sonic's speed unless you want to use all of your rings in a matter of seconds. Thankfully, game mods have popped up that alter Super Sonic's ring consumption rates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">allowing his true potential to shine through,</a> but even so, you're better off just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">setting up a bread and butter skill set</a> if you want to set any good times.
</li><li> Sabata's dark gun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> looks badass and is the <em>only</em> weapon in the game to offer both S-level attack and stun while being a projectile. Unfortunately since it's dark-based it can't even stun, let alone harm, any dark based enemies, which make up over half of the menagerie out to get you. True it <em>trashes</em> all other kinds of enemies, but that's nothing using their elemental weakness against can't accomplish, and you <em>will</em> have all the other lenses since you need to find them all to beat the game, they carry over, and it takes four playthroughs to earn the dark parts. Finally you can't interchange gun parts or use spare batteries.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em>, a lot of charged attacks. They leave you wide open while charging, and a single hit cancels them. And getting hit usually leads to an enemy proceeding with their own combo that leaves you stunlocked for a couple seconds (or longer, if another enemy is lining up for their turn too). Plus, while the charged attacks for melee weapons can result in a flurry of blows, they're often much weaker than regular hits, making the entire thing a waste of time. Charged attacks also guarantee an elemental proc and usually include a full blown stagger or knockdown. A lot of them look pretty, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV">Saints Row IV</a></em>, you can get some really awesome vehicles, soup them up, equip them with pop-out Boadicea spikes and so on...but ultimately you will spend vastly more time using your super-speed and super-jump to get around, with vehicles mostly relegated to missions where you lose your superpowers and occasional trawling for collectibles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcStyleBaseball3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcStyleBaseball3D">Arc Style: Baseball!! 3D</a></em>, it feels so good to groove the strike zone with a fastball, but half the time it's hit for a home run on Hard difficulty (and powerful teams in general, like the Crystals). The same goes for slowballs, which can mess up the batters' swing timing but otherwise are easily hit.
</li><li> A lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a> versions of the Special Weapons in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series fall under this. While certainly flashy and effective while going through stages, against bosses they often do only one more point of damage than an uncharged shot, and even for the ones that take twice as much damage from a charged attack, it's often quicker and more efficient to fire two uncharged shots over wasting time charging up one shot.
</li><li> See that entry on the Hideous Blow invocation under <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a></em>? When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> added the Warlock to its class choices, they included HB... and made it <em>worse</em>. It now takes two turns to make a single attack with it; one to activate the ability, and the other to make the attack. Apparently nobody asked themselves why you couldn't just use your Eldritch Blast twice. (Or attack twice with your weapon, in case you've mistakenly built your Warlock to be a competent Fighter rather than a Warlock.)
</li><li> Throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon">Daedric artifacts</a> tend to be among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Equipment</a>, most often earned by performing quests given by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Princes</a> themselves. Those artifacts associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Sheogorath</a>, however, tend to fall into this trope. Most tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Joke Items</a>, only good for having a bit of fun. For example, Wabbajack is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff">Magic Staff</a> that randomly turns things into other things. It might turn a bandit into a sheep, or a wheel of cheese, or a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Daedroth</a></em>.
</li><li> Throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series, you can throw units, but Prinnies in particular <em>explode</em> when thrown. While they can be used as one-time weapons to clear out enemies, and it's funny as all hell to do so, you won't get most of the rewards you'd otherwise get if you use more conventional methods to defeat enemies; no unit EXP, no skill EXP, no weapon Mastery, no Bonus Gauge, etc. Also, since this kills the Prinny, and dead units count against the deployment limit, every Prinny tossed means one less unit on the field that can actually be doing something of value.
</li><li> The Buzzard Gunship is very much this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>. It can be cool to try flying around in a helicopter armed with dual machine guns and homing missiles, but given how twitchy flying is in the game, it's really, really hard to fly and shoot at the same time. Especially the guns, since they aren't mounted on a turret and strafing is not easy to do. Plus, with the two million dollar price tag, there's almost no way to get enough cash to buy it before you beat the final heist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">leaving you with little to actually do with it</a>.
</li><li> Pikachu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> gains a unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Z Move</a> called Catastropika which has a base damage of <em>210</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note91w20');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note91w20" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note91w20');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For comparison, only Explosion deals more damage</span>. However, using it requires Pikachu hold Pikanium Z, preventing it from holding other items, and the move can only be used once per battle. Contrast Light Ball which not only doubles Pikachu's offensive stats for the entire battle, it makes Volt Tackle (the move needed to use Catastropika) stronger than Catastropika is. So while powerful and awesome looking, pretty much no one actually uses Catastropika. And on top of that, while it may have an insane base power, it's coming off of Pikachu's base attack stat of 55.
</li><li> Ritual monsters in early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> games usually required you to give up three monsters on top of a specific Ritual card, and their stats were barely better than most high-level monsters. Magician of Black Chaos was particularly unlucky in this regard, as its Ritual consistently required one of those monsters to be Dark Magician, who was only 300 points weaker. (In the original card game, these Rituals were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> due to being possible to rapidly summon with materials in the hand.)
</li><li> A number of special abilities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em> are Cool But Inefficient, but the king of the trope is Ashton: almost all of his abilities have an incredible execution time (one of his first abilities, Leaf Slash, takes <em>five seconds</em> to actually activate) and don't do much more damage than Claude's abilities. It's the primary reason Opera is considered better than Ashton.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2">Payday 2</a></em> demonstrates why red dots or crosshairs on scopes or sights are preferred to a novelty scope using a drawing of a hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a>.
</li><li> Megatanks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> are <em>brutally</em> powerful and can one-shot pretty much any land unit, but they are expensive, only carry three rounds of ammo, only have a vision of 1, can only move 4 spaces, and only carry 50 units of fuel, meaning it takes them a million years to get anywhere and they require <em>constant</em> support from an APC (and a Recon or Flare unit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a>) to be of any use. Trying to go on the offensive with these is practically a lost cause because your opponent will see you coming and pick it off with indirect units (<em>especially</em> with the introduction of the Anti-Tank unit in <em>Days of Ruin</em> that cuts these things apart like paper mache). Pretty much the only real use of these things is to park them on your HQ to prevent loss by capture or to block chokepoints, and even <em>then</em> you'd be able to mount a far better defense with the multiple smaller land units you could build for the cost of one of these behemoths.
</li><li> For PC Gaming, cranking up the graphics quality to the maximum more often than not barely improves the visual quality over the next lower quality setting while somehow managing to cause a noticeable drop in performance. You could probably make out differences in side-by-side comparisons, but they're so subtle you're likely not going to notice it in the heat of the action.

In that episode, Quest is working on a new weapon called a "Para-Power Raygun", which, he hopes, gives a practical new military option: the ability to paralyse enemy war machines by removing their power from a distance, thus allowing them to be captured intact, or at least neutralize mechanized units efficiently. However, the gun is used to shoot down the robot, and destroys it. Quest is disappointed, considering that, in being that destructive, the gun is merely an exotic artillery piece that's impractical considering the external generator involved.

<div class="indent"><strong>Edd:</strong> He can't do that, Eddy! You said he wouldn't do that! You said build a bike that <em>looks</em> good! That's it! That's all! <br/><strong>Eddy:</strong> Looking good is what it's all about, Double D. You just <em>lie</em> about the other stuff.

<ul><li> Reflekta's only power is to make people look just like her. Not only does this make Cat Noir's Miraculous vanish when he's hit, but she can't do anything else to him and he's able to continue the fight, hampered only by the awkward clothing.
</li><li> Timebreaker has the same issue, since her tagging Cat Noir to steal temporal energy means she can't grab his Miraculous once he's intangible and vanishing. She has to go back in time for a redo.
</li><li> While powerful, Gigantitan is still just a toddler and impossible to direct to do anything, meaning Hawk Moth can't get him to say his name correctly (calling him "Hawk Moo"), much less defeat the heroes and steal from them. Plus he's so large that it's questionable if he could even remove the earrings and ring he's after.
</li><li> Frightingale can freeze people if they don't dance and speak only in rhyme after hitting them with her whip. So Cat Noir and Ladybug remain unfrozen by rhyming their quips and doing the cha-cha and other dances while fighting her, rendering her powers useless and the whip just a normal weapon.

<h2>Distant past</h2>
<ul><li> The Persian <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythed_chariot">scythed chariot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was an average war chariot with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikedWheels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikedWheels">sharp blades mounted on the axles</a>; the crew just had to plow through the crowd and the scythes would cut in half everyone within 1-2 meters. It wasn't very efficient, as casualties could be greatly avoided by letting it pass, and it could only work in open flat country with enough room to maneuver, but damn, there was nothing as awesome as seeing dozens of soldiers sliced by its might!
<ul><li> This was demonstrated on the "Persian Immortal vs. Celt Warrior" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior">Deadliest Warrior</a></em>, where the Celt warfare experts simply said that it's pretty easy to jump over the scythe, which is exactly what the Celt warrior does in the final simulation before using a sling to take out the chariot driver. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Persian still wins, though</span>.
</li><li> The scythe chariot lasted through no more than one engagement with Alexander the Great. He invented the Mousehole, a simple modification to the formation of his heavy infantry that allowed them to easily trap one when it was driven at them, then kill the driver. Combine that with the fact that heavy infantry was already pretty resistant to the damn thing and Alexander's armies included enough archers to kill horses and crew well before the impact...
</li><li> It was inefficient off the battlefield, as well. Besides the driver, it needed at least one person to maintain the chariot and someone to look after the horses, making it far more expensive to build and operate.
</li><li> The ultimate humiliation for the scyted chariot (and the war chariot in general) came when it was deployed against the Romans, with Roman generals apparently getting off on inventing worse and worse humiliations every time they faced them. The first time (Magnesia) they limited themselves on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">hitting the charioteers and the horses with thousands of arrows and javelins</a>, but at Chaeronea Sulla dealt with them by having his soldiers <em>charge at them, stop and redeploy in a shield wall right before impact</em> (the Roman soldiers reached the chariots when they were still slow and accelerating, and thus the result was that the chariots were stopped dead by the shield wall and the Romans <em>asked for more to play</em>), and at Orchomenus he had his soldiers <em>move away and let the horses driving the chariots impale themselves on the posts behind them</em> (that was the plan B. Plan A was to dig a ditch and force the chariots in a <em>swamp</em>, but the enemy general realized what was happening and attacked right as the Romans started digging). All of this happened when the Romans were for some reason without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">caltrops</a> to throw in their path (they had invented them due the Celts of Northern Italy using a different model of chariot, and were so efficient that by Caesar's time the only Celts who still used it were the more isolated Bretons, who apparently had not yet gotten the memo).
</li></ul></li><li> One can add war elephants to this, once the Romans worked out how to stampede them into the user's own armies. Hannibal was the only one, after the first two encounters, to successfully use elephants against the Romans, with the first success happening because the Romans were completely caught by surprise at seeing a squadron of elephants <em>coming down from the Alps</em> and the second because <em>the elephants getting slaughtered was actually part of his plan</em>.
</li><li> One trick that Chinese archers used was to tie small fireworks to their arrows. This would increase the range and speed of the arrow, but make it unbelievably inaccurate. On the other hand, it added to how terrifying it was, which fit exactly with the way the Chinese used gunpowder in combat: as a means of scaring enemy horses and breaking cavalry charges.
</li><li> The firearms in general were this for a long time. It took over a century after their development before they were considered battleworthy, and another century-plus after that before they fully replaced the bow and arrow. The cannon earned its keep much quicker.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nock_gun">The Nock gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, developed by the British in the late 1700's and used through to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>, is without a shadow of a doubt the coolest blackpowder gun ever devised. It has seven barrels which fire simultaneously due to exhaust vents connecting the central barrel to the surrounding six. The Royal Navy ordered five hundred and they soon developed a bad reputation among sailors for a number of reasons: it was very slow to reload all seven barrels, especially if the gun if question was one of the rifled early models, and it was very difficult to aim because of how broad the gun was. But the real drawback was the absolutely ridiculous recoil which was so bad that the British marines using them would often <em>break their own shoulders</em> firing it, and even when the recoil was toned down they would still find it very uncomfortable to use. Nevertheless, the undeniable coolness factor of the Nock gun means it appears in a <em>lot</em> of fiction for such a limited production weapon, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAlamo1960" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAlamo1960">The Alamo (1960)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbrahamLincolnVampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbrahamLincolnVampireHunter">Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</a></em> (usually as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> of some sort, such as on <em>Sharpe</em>).
</li></ul><p></p><h2>WWI times</h2>
<ul><li> "Fisher's Follies", a group of light battlecruisers built on the orders of Lord Fisher during World War I. Combining armor that was light even for battlecruisers of their size with few but very heavy guns, they were intended for operations in the Baltic Sea (which in the event proved unfeasible) and the heavy guns caused structural damage to the ships themselves when fired. HMS <em>Glorious</em>, <em>Courageous</em> and <em>Furious</em> (nicknamed "Uproarious", "Outrageous" and "Curious") were eventually all converted to aircraft carriers, serving as such in World War II.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> Italy produced the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villar-Perosa_aircraft_submachine_gun">Villar-Perosa submachine gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Designed for infantry use (for the usual logistical issues of Italy at the time, the infantry version was put in service <em>after</em> the modified version for aircrafts), it had two guns firing 1,500 rounds per minute <em>each</em>. Sadly it only had 25 rounds per gun, and its ergonomics were <em>terrible</em> (seriously, just click on that link, look the picture and try to imagine how you can fire it). In a silent acknowledgement of this, most Villar-Perosas were disassembled in their component guns, fitted with rifle stocks and modified to fire slower, obtaining a more usable weapon.
<ul><li> The aircraft version was just as bad. The ergonomics were not a problem anymore, but the combination of 25 rounds per gun and extreme rate of fire meant they could only fire for an incredibly short time. To make it worse, they used the 9mm Glisenti round, basically a weaker 9mm Parabellum round designed for the frail Italian semiautomatics of the time that would <em>bounce</em> on enemy aircrafts.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>WWII times</h2>
<ul><li> Late in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the Germans tried to develop "super weapons" to turn the tide of the war. A lot of them were expensive, inefficient, and had surprisingly short operational lifetimes.
<ul><li> The Vengeance weapons, the V1 cruise missile and the V2 theatre ballistic missile. The V1 was fairly effective for its day, but by the time it was operational the Allies had radar-equipped fighter aircraft and almost complete air superiority, and the majority were shot down long before reaching their targets. The V2 by contrast was impossible to intercept, but wasn't accurate enough to hit anything smaller than a specific city, making it strategically useless. Also, by that time, the Allies were recapturing more and more German-controlled territory, with the result that target cities like London were further and further away from the V2 launch sites. And the only way that the Nazis could improve the V2's range was by reducing the size of the warhead. The Nazis essentially paid several times more for a weapon that did less damage than a conventional formation of bomber planes.
</li><li> The Me-262, the first jet fighter in active duty, which arguably <em>could</em> have affected the course of the war if the Germans had had the fuel to operate them or the time to train the pilots properly, additionaly their engines were horribly maintenance-intensive and they needed a huge runway to take off on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Hitler</a> actually further slowed down the production of these, because he wanted them to be used offensively instead of as interceptors.
</li><li> The Me-163 <em>Komet</em>. A rocket powered fighter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">which could fly nearly-supersonic in 1944</a>, but since the fuel it used was both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">explosively unstable</a> <em>and</em> toxic -the same stuff was used to run the aforementioned V2- it ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredCoffins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredCoffins">killing more of its own pilots</a> than the enemy.
</li><li> The Sanger Silbervogel, an unbuilt orbital bomber which was intended to bomb the US. It was meant to launch by using a large cluster of V2 engines to hurl it down a lateral track fast enough to get it into orbit. If the g-forces from the initial acceleration didn't kill the pilot, he'd simply burn up on reentry, because the designers severely underestimated the effects of atmospheric shock heating on the airframe.
</li><li> An explosive-driven sonic cannon that would use compressed air blasts to shoot down planes was researched — and the only working model had a range of a few dozen meters.
</li><li> The P 1000 Ratte tank. The '1000' was to be the tank's weight, in <em>tons</em>. To compare, the largest tank ever built, the Panzer VIII Maus, another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazi</a> wonder weapon, weighed in at 188 tons. If you want an idea of how the thing would look, just imagine a Baneblade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, and you wouldn't be far off (actually the P 1000 would've even <em>bigger</em> than the Baneblade, which is described at around 500-700 tons depending on the source). The tank was to have two 280 mm naval guns for main armament, with one 128 mm anti tank gun, two 15 mm autocannons, and eight flak guns. It was also to be powered by maritime diesel engines used in U-Boats. The thing would have been a disaster. As slow as an arthritic turtle, lacking in anti-air defenses — target practice for B-17 bombers. Even if the thing was able to defend itself from such attack, all you'd need to do to stop the tank in its tracks is knock out the enormous convoys of fuel tankers it'd need constantly following it. Albert Speer canceled this and the even larger P 1500 Monster, which would at least have been the largest self propelled artillery in history.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav">Schwerer Gustav and Dora.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Two 80-cm rifled artillery guns, each weighing over 1000 tons and firing 7-ton shells. They required twin sets of parallel train tracks to even move around, which sometimes had to be built in front of them. They were designed to be used against the Maginot Line, so they were rendered irrelevant very early in the war, but they each actually saw action in the Soviet front. However, the enormous cost of building, arming and fueling the guns was way out of proportion to the amount of damage they ever did. Still, the guns were arguably useful as some targets in the Siege of Sevastopol were invulnerable to all other types of artillery besides the enormous 800mm guns, such as the "White Cliff" ammunition magazine located 30 meters under the sea, with at least 10 meters of concrete protection. As such they could be said to have played a crucial part in bringing a siege that was tying up valuable units needed elsewhere to a quicker conclusion.
</li><li> Speaking of German railroad artillery, perhaps the Paris Gun of World War I? It was an incredibly advanced piece of technology for its time—it had a range of some eighty miles, still a record for gun-type artillery, and its shells were the first man-made objects to reach the stratosphere—but was also tremendously expensive. The barrel (the longest ever on an operational gun) whipped around each time it was fired, the extreme muzzle velocity caused so much barrel wear that each shell needed to be slightly larger than the one before it, and it was impossible to aim at a specific target. A single lucky shot caused the roof of a church to collapse on the Good Friday congregation beneath, but aside from that it caused very little damage, randomly dropping shells (containing only fifteen pounds of explosives) all over Paris. Some German officers of interwar years (among them Heinz Guderian) wondered why the Germans didn't develop and build some more tanks of their own (the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/A7V" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/A7V">A 7 V</a>, the only German tank of World War I, was built in very small numbers very late in war and it was not very good) instead of this.
</li><li> Perhaps the ultimate in ridiculous Nazi superweapons is the <em>Sonnengewehr</em>, or "Sun Gun": A 100-meter wide magnifying mirror made of metallic sodium orbiting the Earth that would focus the sun's rays and vaporize entire cities like anthills. A crew of astronauts would operate the whole thing wearing magnetic boots to overcome microgravity, with onboard pumpkin patches providing food and air. It never made it past planning stages.
</li><li> You don't even have to look at their superweapons, but just as their regular tanks. Until Speer took over, every time the engineers came up with a new improvement in a tank design they would change the production line. While in theory this resulted in better tanks, in practice it was a mess because a unit could have tanks that didn't have interchangeable parts, making logistics a nightmare, even though the tanks would supposedly be the same model. Making this even worse was the German tendency to develop machines that were "more efficient, more elegantly designed, and needing five times as many parts". The Allies adopted a more logical approach, allowing proposed changes to accumulate until there was enough to justify a new model, and keeping things as simple as possible.
</li><li> Even their own mass production vehicles suffered this issue. German tanks are infamous for their inter-weaving wheels, <em>Schachtelllaufwerk</em> ("checkerboard running gear"), which was meant as a way to getting more axles onto a smaller tank (and thus not only allow it to carry more weight on a smaller frame, but also ensure the ride was smooth and with less bumps, as well as be essentially extra armor). This is all good for an operational tank, but repairing them were a nightmare since you had to remove the outer wheels first, effectively doing up to three times the work depending on how deep the damage was. Combined with the above (where each tank was unique in design) meant that German repair crews often didn't even have <em>enough parts</em> to fix any one specific tank due to logistics not being able to ship enough of them fast enough to the front lines. The Allies resolved the "bumpy ride" issue by having a practical workaround - a gyroscopically stablized main gun.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fliegerfaust">Fliegerfaust<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was to be used as a personal anti-air rocket launcher that launched nine rockets at a time. It never saw combat use since its spread was too great and it never reached the desired range. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Sanya</a> likes it though.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG_42">FG-42 early model<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had most possibly the coolest design of any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> small arm and it had been designed to combine the machine gun and rifle into one unit small enough to be carried by a paratrooper (it was as short as a modern AK-74, but had a 50cm barrel and fired full-power 7.92x57 ammo). Most of its cool features proved useless: it was too light to keep steady when firing full-automatic (half the weight of a BAR), too awkward to aim at distant targets (it was much shorter than a rifle), had too small a magazine for use as a machine gun, needed expensive alloys, and it could not mount a true bayonet, only a metal spike instead of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Although much has been made of the impractical nature of German weapons of the Second World War, their allies on the other side of the globe, the Japanese Empire, had plenty of these as well. Many of these never made it past the drawing board, or saw limited numbers.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-400-class_submarine">I-400-class submarine aircraft carrier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The I-400 series of submarines were designed for clandestine attacks utilizing three floatplane fighter-bombers, stored in a pressurized hangar built into the submarine's hull. The idea was to create an aircraft carrier that could attack a target and vanish without being detected. However, several problems kept these from being practical attack options. To start with, the I-400's were not that stealthy. The large size of the subs gave them an equally massive radar signature and made them easier to see from the air. They also took longer to dive than other submarines; roughly 54 seconds, which was almost twice the speed of U.S submarines, leaving them vulnerable in an emergency. Their small rudders made them difficult to maneuver and they could be blown off course in strong winds or waves when on the surface, while under the waves they had to be steered slightly starboard to go straight. By the time the war ended, of the eighteen planned I-400's, only three were made, with the last being converted to a tanker, never being used for their intended function. Despite the relative lack of use, they were an impressive feat of engineering and awesomely huge. Reportedly, when the I-400 surrendered to a destroyer of the U.S Navy, the destroyermen were in awe of the size.
</li><li> Although the "cool" aspect is debatable, given that it was designed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">human-operated flying bomb</a>, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka_MXY7_Ohka">MXY7 "Ohka"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> might still qualify. Powered by rockets, the "Ohka" was loaded with several hundred pounds of explosives and launched at enemy ships from the underside of a "Betty" bomber. Screaming at their targets at over 500 mph in a dive, the "Ohka" was intended to be too fast for Allied ships to target effectively. However, because the rockets were difficult to steer, the effectiveness of Allied anti-aircraft fire, and the potential for the much slower "Betty" bombers to get shot down before the "Ohka" were even launched meant that the overall damage to Allied ships was negligible. Of the about 20 to 40 "Okha" deployed in combat, they only managed to sink or damage seven U.S ships.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_97_automatic_cannon">Type 97 automatic cannon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">a man-portable semi-automatic anti-tank cannon</a>. Of course, "man portable" is probably pushing it, given that with a protective shield included (to protect the two-man crew from the <em>gun</em>, not the <em>enemy</em>, it should be noted) it weighed 68 kilograms (150 lbs). Firing 20mm rounds semi-automatically from a seven-round box magazine, it was capable of an impressive amount of firepower. Of course, all this awesomeness was rendered moot thanks to developments in tank armor. By 1942, it was obsolete. It was also the basis for the Ho-1 and Ho-3 aircraft cannons.
</li><li> One of the more interesting (and disturbing) Japanese weapons development avenues was research into what we would now consider "microwave" weaponry. Inspired by Nikola Tesla's theoretical "death ray" weapon, the "Ku-go" was a projected "microwave cannon" that utilized magnetron technology. Exact details are scant, but the weapon was apparently tested in laboratory conditions, with some reports suggesting it was used on lab animals. The ultimate goal of an area-denial weapon would have likely been impossible or impractical, given the technology of the era. Only recently have any developments in microwave weapons been considered practical, or even feasible.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nazis weren't alone in their crazy plans.
<ul><li> The Allies once tried to develop a large aircraft carrier <a class="urllink" href="http://amasci.com/amateur/pykrete.html">made mostly out of frozen mulch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. That's right, a gigantic ship made of icy wood pulp. It was designed to be much more resistant to German torpedoes and other hull breaches, since a block of frozen wood pulp is surprisingly resilient.
</li><li> Another example of bizarre weapons on the Allied side is Walther Christie's ...unconventional... <a class="urllink" href="http://www.roadabletimes.com/roadables-modular_Christie.html">contribution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to airborne warfare.
</li><li> British scientists also played around with a grenade design that shot poisonous needles everywhere instead of standard shrapnel. It was scrapped early on due to the incredibly large sadism-to-usefulness ratio, and the fact that its use probably flies in the face of dozens of tenets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a>.
</li><li> The Soviets in turn, featured swimming and airborne tanks (which however, due to weight constrains, proved to be too lightly armed and armored to be useful, though in the context of behind-the-lines partisan warfare/recon for which the tank was intended those factors were not actually that much of a problem, leading to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMD-1">BMD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> line of airborne armored vehicles). As well as the MiG-3, an interceptor only effective at 3km altitude or higher (useful against high-altitude strategic bombers, but the Germans never managed to make any).
</li><li> The Americans not only made a swimming version of the M4 Sherman, they actually used it at the Battle of Normandy. Granted, a number of them quickly sank as soon as they lumbered off the landing craft, but imagine you're a German machine-gunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">watching a tank drive out of the ocean and aim its 75mm gun right at you</a> and you can understand why they were used, despite the difficulties.
</li><li> And just to prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> don't have a monopoly on ridiculous tank designs, there's the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOG2">TOG.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Armoured better than some small warships, a main gun that could reliably punch a hole in even the legendary Tiger... and a top speed of about eight miles an hour.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">MiG-19 fighter</a> was cutting edge for 1954 due to supersonic speed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">multiple heavy cannons</a>, long range and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">good handling</a>, yet it could not go above Mach 1.5, could overheat its own fuel tanks in the fuselage, was tremendously hard to maintain or repair due to fuselage construction (very closely spaced ribs and small engine bays meant all work had to be done through small hatches above them).
</li><li> The F-104 could fly at above Mach 2, was cheap, was the closest thing to breaching the sound barrier by strapping a rocket at your back, and crashed down so often to earn such unflattering nicknames as "lawn dart", "flying coffin", "tent peg" and "widow maker". Amazingly enough, Italy managed to create a working and reliable aircraft from this mess...
</li><li> Stealth air superiority fighters. Invisible to radar... well, depends on distance, radar's type and wavelength. VHF and HF radars can detect them at tactically useful ranges. IRST can detect them as well, and are passive - so if stealth fighter uses IRST to detect the enemy, it loses any advantage in detection range and if it uses radar, it is detected by enemy radar warners. They are also heavier and typically carry less payload than comparable non-stealth fighters (compare F-22 and F-15, F-35 and F-16, PAK FA and Su-27), as well as very costly and very hard to maintain.
<ul><li> Additionally the US has now developed 3 generations of stealth aircraft at a staggering cost to the tax payers, while other countries have only recently developed their 1st generation. Repeated upgrades when they were up against no competition, now that's inefficient.
</li></ul></li><li> It is an old saw that the M-16, for all its precision, is not remotely as reliable as the less-accurate Russian AK-47 (as aficionados will point out, a properly-maintained M-16 works very well, and a AK-47 — not a knock-off — with good-quality ammunition will shoot quite accurately; however, this remains the common perception). Most of the focus in the discussion was the Vietnam war, where most of the problems with the M-16 were because of several issues: First, it was put into production way too early (as such they were using a prototype,) they said the gun was self-cleaning (which it wasn't) and therefore didn't distribute <em>any cleaning kits</em>, the chrome plating on the barrel bore (which would've helped keep it clean) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">eliminated as a cost-saving measure</a>, and the casings were packed with the wrong kind of propellant. All this combined with the harsh conditions soldiers had to drag them through led to a slew of reliability problems.
<ul><li> Today, however, it is an excellent weapon for the US military. Indeed, one interesting factor of a great deal of US Military equipment is that it works excellently but requires proper maintenance and logistics backing it up. Ironically, this turns it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">into an advantage:</a> captured equipment can't be used very long before it will stop functioning effectively. Moreover, developing countries can't duplicate the equipment effectively because they can't maintain or support it properly.
</li></ul></li><li> Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the <a class="urllink" href="http://airbornecombatengineer.typepad.com/airborne_combat_engineer/2005/01/the_thunder_50_.html">Thunder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://airbornecombatengineer.typepad.com/airborne_combat_engineer/2005/01/the_maadi_griff.html">Maadi Griff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> .50 BMG handguns. Yes, <em>handguns</em>.
<ul><li> Most real-life examples <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a> are this outside of specialist applications like defence against large predators. A normal human is just as dead if shot a couple of times in their centre of mass with an ordinary 9mm or .45ACP pistol as with a Desert Eagle in .50 Action Express or whatever, and the former do not require the shooter to spend several hours a week at the gym for the upper-body strength to control their substantial recoil and thus reliably hit a man-sized target beyond a couple of paces. Ammunition tends to be cheaper in bulk as well. They do have better armor penetration, but unlike in videogames, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchPackingPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchPackingPistol">Punch-Packing Pistol</a> doesn't scale all that well next to a proper rifle, which also has better aim, range, rate of fire, capacity, and ease-of-use.
</li></ul></li><li> The virtues of lasers as a weapon system are <em>heavily</em> debated, with innumerable threads on forums, the old Usenet, etc. filled with heated discussions of their flaws, virtues, and relative expense versus shooting bits of metal at high speed. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better</a>. One plausible use for lasers might just be to take advantage of the fact that a laser beam is just coherent, high-intensity light and <em>blind</em> your target(s). As in, quite possibly for good. That'd still be a far cry from having a proper futuristic ray gun. More of a terror weapon, in fact... to the point that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">Geneva conventions</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.un.org/millennium/law/xxvi-18-19.htm">specifically prohibit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the use of lasers in this way.
</li><li> Also consider the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrojet">Gyrojet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Replacing regular bullets with small rockets meant the projectiles needed to travel something like 60 feet before they actually do any damage. In addition a manufacturing defect made them wildly inaccurate, the four angled jets spin the projectile through the entire flight instead of just in the barrel so early tests were <em>more</em> accurate than rifles but in later runs one of the jets was partially blocked off by accident.
</li><li> The Ingram MAC-11 machine pistol. While it admittedly has tremendous rate of fire (up to 1600 rounds per minute), said ROF can quickly empty its 32 round magazine in an instant. Additionally many variants were sold with a 16 round magazine instead; better for concealment, but even less practical given the blistering rate of fire. Due to its short barrel, light weight, and top-heavy bolt, it is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">horribly inaccurate</a>. The all-sheet metal construction also gives it several sharp edges and uncomfortable angles on the grip, and it's not any easier to control in semi-auto fire thanks to the bolt's very aggressive back &amp; forth rocking with every shot.
</li><li> The Pancor Jackhammer automatic shotgun. While a favorite of movies and video games due to its futuristic appearance and amazing visual design, the real Jackhammer was notoriously over-engineered. Reloading the gun required the user to lock the barrel forward, eject the drum magazine, and either put in a new drum or remove the spent shells from the old one and put new ones in like a revolver. Either way made the weapon more time-consuming and problematic to reload than a regular automatic shotgun while also removing the ability to chamber specific shells as needed, one of the big reasons shotguns remain popular. Its unique shape also made it incompatible with the wide variety of attachments available for more mundane shotguns, like flashlights, which made it less versatile. It was also prone to breaking down - Of the three prototypes made, two of them were irreparably damaged in testing.
</li><li> Holding a gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">Gangsta Style</a> is somewhat notorious for this: it looks pretty rad, but there's a reason it's named after people who mostly <em>pose</em> with their guns rather than firing them, as it's a good way to kill off your accuracy completely.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life — Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<ul><li> The <em>Spruce Goose,</em> which was the largest heavier-than-air aircraft in the world at the time of production. It was only an 'aircraft' in the technical sense once, and then only for a few hundred yards. Very pretty, though.
<ul><li> The reason it flew only a few hundred yards was the guy behind it, Howard Hughes, was trying to prove that it could, in fact, actually fly during Congressional hearings into the money he'd extracted from the US government to build it (and one criticism was that it wasn't able to fly). It wasn't a bad idea, it just turned out to be too late and not needed. During WWII, it was not always clear that it would turn out to be possible to stop U-boat attacks on Allied convoys sufficiently to keep supply shipments to Britain going, so Hughs proposed giant transport aircraft instead. The Spruce Goose was the prototype. As things went, it wasn't ready for testing until after the war ended and a whole bunch of things made U-boats themselves fall into this category before the end of the war anyway.
<ul><li> It didn't help that the B-29 (a long-range strategic bomber) could do the job the <em>Spruce Goose</em> was meant to do (i.e. delivering critical things from the US to Europe) faster while using substantially less fuel. It took 24,000hp and 8 engines just for the <em>Spruce Goose</em> to make its one and only flight. A B-29 had about 8,800hp, a 20,000lb payload, and a 3,250mi range. That's about 200mi short of New York to London and 250mi past what the <em>Spruce Goose</em> was intended to do. A fully loaded B-29 needed to stop in Iceland to refuel and could make something like a 5,600 mile long ferry flight.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The legendary <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Regal#Grand_National.2C_Turbo-T.2C_T-Type.2C_and_GNX">Buick Grand National / GNX<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the revenge for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> of automotive design of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, able to run from zero to 60 in just 4.7 seconds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">faster than a Ferrari Testarossa</a>. Which also proved its factory quoted horsepower were bullshit, it's mathematically impossible to run a heavy brick-shaped car so quick with just 276hp, the real figures might have been in the 330-370hp range. However, owners reported it was more like a "one-wheel drive", which would twist and raise rear wheels sideways upon launch, one by one like cartoon cars do.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech_Duke">Beech Duke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Reasonably fast (for a piston twin), pressurized, and damn but it's pretty. It's also horribly unreliable and costs approximately the GNP of a small country to maintain. But <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnCT24qod4M">you'd look cool in it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Gas-turbine-powered railway vehicles. Sure, a turboshaft engine produces <em>way</em> more power in comparison to a diesel engine of the same size. But they also consume a lot more, and they do not consume notably less at idle in comparison to full throttle. So in order to operate a gas turbine economically, you have to run it at full throttle as much as possible and shut it down whenever you don't need it. However, in railway uses, a gas turbine spends only very little time at actual full throttle, namely while accelerating, and frequently starting it up doesn't do a gas turbine good. Cheaper, lower-quality fuel may reduce operational costs but at the same time harm the turbine more, and it isn't really "cheap" anymore nowadays anyway. Not hard to guess why almost everyone's back to piston diesels today.
</li><li> Steam locomotives. You have to admit that they're pretty cool. But you also have to admit that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">their thermal efficiency is round about one-digit</a>.
<ul><li> And according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.spikesys.com/Trains/loco_bot.html">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> it takes around 8 hours to 'boot' from cold to ready to go.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Other technology</h2>
<ul><li> Companies have always been sending spam everywhere and to everyone to boost their profit, using the infamous spambots to do so. Recently it turned out a bunch of Chinese people could do it cheaper and more efficiently.
</li><li> The large expensive robots required to automate some of the boring drudgery in molecular biology, protein purification etc. A bunch of Chinese people can do it cheaper. Apparently two European people with a multi-pipetter could also do it cheaper, but it's easier to get a million Euros for a machine than for 15 years employment.
</li><li> Tablet computers are essentially giant smartphones straight out of old sci-fi movies, but without the convenience of phone calls and easy messaging. Even their feature of size is being overshadowed by the production of larger smartphones. This could end up a subversion with the growth of tablet-laptop hybrids, or two-in-ones, which are more portable than the average laptop without being a pain in the ass when it comes to extensive typing work.
</li><li> There was once <a class="urllink" href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SquareHoleDrillInThreeDimensions/">a drill bit which drilled square holes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the cross-section was a Reuleaux triangle, a rounded triangle of constant diameter). The trouble with it was, it needed a template to be affixed to the drilling site <em>and</em> a special floating chuck to spin the bit. For most purposes, drilling a circular hole (or set of holes) and sawing/filing out the rest is a lot more practical.
</li><li> Audiophile equipment tends to be this by design, for a number of reasons depending on component.
<ul><li> Class A amplifiers are considered to be the purest form of amplification, since they have the highest linearity and lowest signal distortion, but their always-conducting, single-transistor design puts them at a pitiful 30% efficiency, with the rest of the utilized energy being dispersed as waste heat - something that tends to kill off components not designed to withstand it for extended periods of operation. Classes B and AB were designed as more efficient compromises, with two transistors working in a push-pull configuration; the difference is that Class AB trades a bit of efficiency for a smoother crossover between the transistors, but still attains a noticeably improved 50% to 60% efficiency over the Class A design.
</li><li> Higher-end drivers (that is, the elements of a speaker or headphone that produce sound) tend to be stiffer and less sensitive, thus requiring more energy to move, but also being less prone to distortion. Whether that energy is current or voltage depends on driver type; dynamic and orthodynamic drivers tend to demand current, but electrostatic drivers instead require excessive voltages anywhere from 230V to 600V and beyond, which in turn requires either transformers with powerful conventional amplifiers, or purpose-built electrostatic amplifiers.
<ul><li> Combine the above points with the occasional preference for vacuum tubes instead of transistors in amplifier design, and you end up with equipment that guzzles power, runs hot, and invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">Crack Is Cheaper</a> on components <em>alone</em> before you factor in any markups... all for the sake of high-fidelity sound. Bonus coolness points if you're using orthodynamic or electrostatic loudspeakers, which have an inherently planar design to their drivers that makes them look like large, sound-emitting panels rather than the big boxes that dynamic drivers reside in.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Modern technology (i.e. electrical energy) <em>itself</em> isn't very efficient. Sure, it can provide a wide variety of functions, from lighting rooms to heating, to this computer that we are using to type this very page. However, the bulk of this energy comes from nonrenewable resources, so when it's gone, it's gone. When compared to earlier technology, which largely managed by mechanical energy (less powerful, but you can continue to run it simply being eating), it's kinda this. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.edf.org/blog/2014/05/27/why-you-only-get-25-electricity-you-pay">It also turns out 75% of all electricity is wasted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Speaking of, incandescent light bulbs have been an infamous example of this for years. Being only 5% efficient, they waste <em>95% of their energy</em> as heat rather than light<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1002pm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1002pm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1002pm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though in some cases the heat was put to use. In traffic lights, for example, the bulbs heat prevented them from being blotted out by ice or snow, and of course toys like the Easy Bake Oven used light bulbs as their heating element</span>. Thing is though, until we had the technology to make LED bulbs and they became reasonably affordable, incandescent bulbs were your only option unless you wanted to bust out some candles or a lantern.
</li><li> This is what hurt the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> and its bright color screen during its run and helped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Simple, yet Awesome</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> with its green monochrome reign supreme in the handheld market. Game Gear looked great, but it took six AA batteries and would drain them in about three hours, while the Game Boy only needed four AA's and would last a whopping <em>thirty hours</em>. Even the Game Boy Pocket which took only two AAA batteries lasted around ten hours to Game Gear's three, meaning unless you liked constantly buying batteries or sitting at home with an AC cable (thus defeating the purpose of a <em>portable</em> console), the Game Gear was just too darned inefficient.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul><li> Black fatigue-style uniforms; the quintessential staple of Hollywood and video game special forces teams for decades. Unfortunately that's because in fiction their enemies are only as vigilant as the script writer commands them to be. In real life it is quite possibly one of the worst shades you could wear short of something stupid like shocking pink. This is due in large part to the fact that there are very few blacks in either nature or man-made environments meaning that in daylight you stand out just about everywhere and at night colors such as dark blue or green work just as well if not better. Generally speaking the only way to make black genuinely useful is to pair it with something else; for example white and/or grey. In real life, black fatigues do have their uses, such as security, riot control, breaching/raid teams and the like, but note that these are all situations where the wearer <em>wants</em> to be visible, so as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary">intimidate potential troublemakers</a> out of making trouble in the first place.
</li><li> This is regarded as one of the main reasons why we don't have even a single piece of corroborated evidence as to the existence of extra-terrestrials. Even to a race immeasurably superior to our own technologically; the problems inherent in funding, building, powering, designing, stocking, defending and accelerating an interstellar (let alone an intergalactic) spacecraft are so hilariously large that any attempt to do so would probably be far more trouble than it is actually worth. One could also levy this exact same reasoning as to why we aren't being constantly bombarded with travelers from the future or from other universes assuming that either of those things are possible/exist obviously.
</li><li> Fine dining is this for the end customer. Sure, going to that fancy schmancy restaurant with three Michelin Stars lets you experience some of the most finely-honed tastes and dishes that look like they could go in an art gallery, but unless you're filthy rich, it's not very efficient to pay hundreds of dollars a meal every time, and it's not like the dishes are jumbo portions or more nutritious than cheaper cuisine either.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueDoctor">Plague Doctor</a>/s. Yup, you read that correctly. Many medical historians agree that the doctors' outfits were often full of bacteria because of lack of cleaning, making the belief that Plague Doctors spread disease instead of curing it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>.
</li><li> Roman numerals. They're among the most iconic and visually appearing ways of writing numbers, which may be why they're often used in sequel titles, and after popes and monarchs' names. Despite that, it's often rather cumbersome to write large numbers with them, especially ones that have a 3 or 8 digit; for example, 3,888 would be written as MMMDCCCLXXXVIII.
