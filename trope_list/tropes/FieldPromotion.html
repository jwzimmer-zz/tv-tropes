And it often does, because mortality weeded out the senior ranks, and because the jump is often not that great. There is often a ripple effect: brevet a captain to major; brevet a lieutenant to captain to replace him; brevet a sergeant to lieutenant to replace him; and finally, brevet a private to sergeant to replace <em>him</em>. Normally, under this trope, their existing ranks are not put out of order; the sergeant doesn't become the major over the head of a lieutenant, etc.

<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, Captain Gloval (old tough veteran of the Unification Wars) laments the inexperience of his crew when the newly rebuilt and untested superdimensional fortress comes under sudden attack from mysterious aliens at the start of the series.
</li><li> Captain Natora Einus got her command this way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em>, jumping from raw lieutenant to command of the previously-mothballed <em>Diva</em> when she isn't remotely prepared for the position. In her case, however, the man who put her there was doing so to spite Admiral Flit (Ret.) and get rid of a bunch of "useless" personnel at the same time, not because she was the only officer he could find.

<ul><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SgtRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SgtRock">Sgt. Rock</a></em>, of course, started out as a buck private, and while many of his actions were considered worthy of promotion, Easy Company's TO was apparently full. Until a certain battle, whereupon as fatalities accumulated, he was promoted to PFC, Corporal, and finally Sergeant in short order. Not how he would have preferred to earn his stripes, to say the least.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> series <em>The Pit</em>, the eponymous character promotes a cadet to full judge when the kid finds a stack of unpaid parking tickets in Fonzo Bongo's name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars: Empire: To the Last Man</a></em> an Imperial Army column gets surrounded by native warriors and faces destruction. As the casualties mount, General Ziering promotes Lieutenant Janek Sunber to Captain and eventually Commander. When Lt. Sunber manages to get back to headquarters the only other surviving officer refuses to verify his promotion and he gets bumped back down to Lieutenant due to the other officer being envious of the man's bravery, competence, and favor with the general - he refuses to verify the field-promotions just to spite him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a> and the Chieftain's Shield</em>, Caesar orders that the eponomyous shield, which was stolen following his victory at Alesia, be found so that he can be carried on it in front of the rebellious Gauls as a symbol of his victory over them. He orders the Prefect of Arverne to find it and every Roman soldier in the city begin desperately searching the numerous coal sheds in town to find it. At the end of the book it turns out Vitalstatistix has it and the town parades in front of Caesar lead by him and Asterix, while the soot-covered Romans are left on the sidelines. Caesar promotes the only two clean soldiers in the city (a drunken Centurion and a slacker Legionnaire), who ducked out of the search, to Prefect and Centurion respectively and leaves, saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain">no-one shall ever mention these events or this town in his presence again</a>.

"I'm betting that's not supposed to have happened, so what does it mean?" <br/>Sergeant Bir gave Asuka a very weary look. "It means I think you just got promoted, ma'am."
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AvengersInfiniteWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AvengersInfiniteWars">Avengers: Infinite Wars</a></em>, this term could apply to how some of the Avengers have unofficially adopted leadership roles among the clones after joining the Clone Wars on the side of the Republic, despite not having any qualifications that the Republic would recognise. At least one Avenger (specifically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matt Murdock/Daredevil</span>) has to specifically clarify that he should just be considered another soldier during a mission rather than a commander, even as Sam Wilson and Rhodey act as leaders of a flight division and Captain America is treated as a commander when on missions with the clones.

Killer B is still a Genin but as he explains to Naruto, he was a genin during the Third Shinobi World War. At some point, he became a squad leader and started getting treated like a jonin.

<ul><li> General Revil hands over a set of captain's insignia to Jeannette Montange when the two meet, jumping her straight there from Sergeant. It's strongly implied the promotion is mainly for morale purposes: she and her tank crew are the only Zaku-killer aces in the entire Earth Federation Ground Forces at that point.
</li><li> In an even more literal case, it's revealed that Revil chose, literally at the moment he held out his hand to Cat Stevens, to have Cat's disciplinary record wiped clean and restore his rank of sergeant.
</li><li> In the next chapter, it's revealed Jeannette and her crew have been brevetted up at least one more rank; the EFGF has called up all its reserves and is recalling anyone who ever served, and desperately needs people with combat experience to fill officer and senior NCO posts. They're so desperate it's implied the only reason Ritchie Smith (who's been in the army for barely two and a half months despite his impressive record as a gunner) isn't commanding his own tank is that Jeannette talked someone out of giving him one; she thinks his quest for revenge would get him and any crew he commanded killed.

In one scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">he chokes the idiotic Admiral Ozzel</a>, and immediately addresses Captain Piett as Admiral Piett, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">putting him in command right then and there</a>. And with the previous Admiral <em>still choking in the background</em>, there's a very tacit reminder of the consequences of messing up. Meanwhile, the trap at Cloud City fails, but Vader's reaction is different — more disappointment and sadness than anger — so Piett goes on to be one of three Imperial characters to appear in more than one movie in the original trilogy. After all, it was not because of Piett's planning, plus he wasn't a jerk about it. Ozzel wasn't so smart when he decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">being arrogant to Vader was a smart idea</a>.

Certainly he was <em>commanding</em> as many men as a captain would by the end.
</li><li> The series also did a very dark take on the more usual sort of Field Promotion. When Mal is trying to get some air support for himself and his men, he is told that the cover won't come without a Lieutenant's orders. Mal promptly walks over to the body of Lieutenant Baker, tears off the patch of his uniform with his authorization code, and hands it back to the person he was talking to, saying "Here, you're Lieutenant Baker. Congratulations on your promotion, now get us some air support!"

Due to the extreme attrition (33,000 Americans were lost in the battle), he is involuntarily promoted to Sergeant (E-5) and made a squad leader on the promise that should he survive he will be evacuated for battle fatigue and given a Section-8 discharge. The evacuation and discharge never happens, and then due again to attrition and the mental breakdown of his platoon leader, he is involuntarily promoted to 2Lt (O-1). This is an example of Truth in Television, as the Battle for the Hurtgen Forest in reality lasted 5 months (the longest battle in US military history) and was enormously bloody with greater than 25% casualties suffered by American forces and many smaller units entirely annihilated. Men who entered the Forest in September of 1944 as privates were almost guaranteed to leave at significantly higher rank if they survived until the battles conclusion in February 1945. Two entire US divisions, the 4th and 9th Infantry could not even use battle field promotions to replace all of the lost NCO's and officers, and were forced to withdraw from combat to rebuild.

</li><li> Earlier, Rico is breveted from lance-corporal/Assistant Squad leader to sergeant/Assistant Section Leader (skipping corporal/squad leader). The officer in charge feels that it makes more sense to leave as many squads as possible with their squad leaders, since the MI mostly operates by squad, and things have been rough lately.
</li><li> It's also mentioned that Rico is breveted to Sergeant a week before he leaves for OCS, but that this is less of a promotion and more that Lt. Jelal is giving him shiny new stripes to show off for a week as a "going away"-present.
</li><li> A subversion happens when Rico is at OCS. We find out one of his fellow officer candidates received a battlefield commission as a 1st Lieutenant some time prior (In case anyone didn't realize it, graduates of OCS start out with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, so Rico's classmate would actually be <em>demoted</em> after graduating, assuming he gets that far.) The reason he's attending OCS is to become an officer "properly" - as a battlefield commissioned officer (with no higher education), his chances of rising higher than Lieutenant are very small. With Academy education and field command experience, his prospects are suddenly very good indeed.

<ul><li> In <em>Ghostmaker</em>, Gaunt has just gotten a large portion of a regiment off Tanith before its destruction. When his men tell him that the officers were all on planet and dead, he appoints the man who told him (and did most of the talking in the meeting) as Colonel, and the man who came with him as Major, and told them to appoint appropriate junior officers. He does this partly because those two men were chosen by the other soldiers to approach him, and so clearly command some sort of respect among their peers. He's also well aware that at least one of them hates his guts and wants to "keep his enemies closer."
</li><li> In the series's backstory, the current Warmaster Macaroth was promoted to his position by Warmaster Slaydo during the liberation of Balhaut. Slaydo, who was mortally wounded, specifically named Macaroth, who was a relative unknown, as his successor. Though nobody is exactly sure why he chose Macaroth, many scholars believe that Slaydo did so in order to prevent the other senior officers from fighting over his position.

<ul><li> The series begins with the Valhallan 597th being pieced together from two regiments torn up in combat with Tyranids, with the rush of promotions that situation implies. Some regiments are worse off than others, though - mention is made of a Lieutenant promoted directly to colonel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">by default</a>. Even worse, her second-in-command Major Broklaw, who had considerably more combat experience than Colonel Kasteen, lost out on the promotion because she had <em>three days</em> seniority over him. And of course, merging an all-female regiment with an all-male one brings its own problems. Fortunately, Cain's management skills are up to the task, and Kasteen and Broklaw are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> by the end of the book.
</li><li> In <em>Death or Glory</em>, he promotes a lieutenant and a sergeant to manage his ramshackle army, and two artisans are assigned to help their only engineer (they end up becoming lay brothers of the Mechanicus cult later). The book also notes that these promotions would have to be finalized by the actual army since Cain as a Commissar is not inside the chain of command. However, denying promotions handed out by a Commissar would likely bring the attention of the Commissariat, which no one really wants...
</li><li> Jenit Sulla gets a variation: instead of a straight promotion, she gets breveted to the position, which gives her a trial run (if she fails, it doesn't leave a demotion on her record). To Cain's surprise, it sticks, and Amberley Vail's footnotes state that Sulla ultimately became the only woman in Imperial history to reach the rank of Lord General Militant.
</li><li> In <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>, he brevets the commissars-in-training as commissars. At the end, he ensures that all the survivors actually hold that rank.

This is despite the former's distrust and dislike for the latter due to the events of the previous book. Similarly, Verity is told by the convent's canonness that she is now a Sister Militant, no longer a Hospitaller, as the convent is assaulted by a massive Necron force, and is given a master-crafted bolt pistol to start her off.

In the fourth book, only twelve survivors remain from the entire Empress' Own Regiment, and the senior (a company sergeant major) is promoted all the way to full Colonel in one jump to fill the obvious gap. Prince Roger himself, in the first book, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">a callow youth</a> in severe need of discipline and training. So his bodyguard CO, a captain, field demotes him to second lieutenant (As a member of the royal family, he is technically a Colonel of The Empress' Own) and hands him a platoon. The captain does this partly because he needs someone to command the platoon, but mostly so he can gleefully watch the platoon sergeant's stunned reaction. It also has the added advantage of keeping Rodger safer by giving him a fixed position. Yes, putting him directly on the firing line is safer than letting him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">decide what to do on his own</a>.
</li><li> Jim Butcher's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> has this.
<ul><li> In <em>Furies of Calderon</em> Gaius Sextus, First Lord of Alera, gives a variation. He promotes a then-trainee Cursor Amara to full nobility with the title of Countess before sending her on a mission in his name. While not strictly military, it would have the same gravitas as a military rank.
</li><li> In the third book <em>Cursor's Fury</em> Scipio, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is an alias for Tavi</span>, jumps from Third Subtribune Logistica (junior supply officer) to Captain of a Legion is more of of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a> but he starts handing out field promotions left, right and center to fill holes in the legion's absolutely shattered command structure. The fourth book reveals that most of them stick too.
</li><li> In the same book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bad guys planned for this by having a mole higher up in rank and nobility than Third Subtribune to take over when the other officers are removed.

By the end of the book (i.e. the very next day for him), he's a regional commander of the Warden's North America division, mostly because the other regional commander was promoted at the same time as him and has far less experience. Instead of demonstrating his badassitude, it shows how desperate the ongoing war has become. The Captain who drafts him also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">points out they lost so many because of a mole. If Harry doesn't join, many will start to think he is the mole</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">Polgara the Sorceress</a></em>, Sergeant Torgun has to go a little beyond his orders to head off trouble at one point. When he reports:

(As recruitment into the Citizen's Milita goes critical, some people are promoted by officers who don't strictly have the right to do so, and others are under the impression you <em>decide</em> what your rank is, based on how many other people you've recruited.)

Later, Devious Collabone finds himself field promoted from university researcher, to doctor, and then again to professor, in the span of a few minutes. Mainly because a civilian tried to gainsay him in the presence of Unseen University's Archchancellor, Mustrum Ridcully, a firm believer in Retaliation By Promotion.
</li><li> Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel (actually a time-lost Sam Vimes) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch Discworld</a></em> promotes Corporal Colon to sergeant during the Siege of Treacle Mine Road.

She herself is given a field promotion of sorts — put in charge of a squad despite not technically being a member of the Own, because the higher-ups know its actual leader can't handle the job.

</li><li> In Joe Haldeman's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar">The Forever War</a></em>, Mandella starts as a private, and ends the war as a major commanding his own ground force.

<ul><li> The funny thing is that the person who recommended them for that field promotion was the commander of the British forces - being defeated by a Colonel is far less embarrassing for a Major General than being defeated by a brevet Captain who was only there by chance.

She is chosen over Lt. Carey even though she did not graduate Starfleet Academy.
</li><li> Chakotay, another Maquis and a former Starfleet officer, is given his Lieutenant Commander rank back (and later promoted to Commander) and her first officer. Combined with his being a Maquis captain, he ends up as something of a double subversion.
</li><li> Tom Paris, a legitimate but disgraced Starfleet lieutenant, was reinstated. Later in the series, he got demoted for disobeying orders, and promoted later on.
</li><li> Tuvok, who was serving with the Maquis as a double-agent, was reinstated to his Starfleet rank of Lieutenant, and was later promoted to Lieutenant Commander; however, this was treated as a standard promotion.
</li><li> And poor Harry Kim gets to be the aversion, despite seven years of harrowing and dangerous missions in the Delta Quadrant and endless night watches, remaining an Ensign all the way to end of the series (then again, it's not as if anybody else got promoted past their initial commission either). It's continually suggested that he gets fast-tracked up the ranks once he's back home and made captain in less than ten years.

<ul><li> One of the commanders of a Philippine resistance group against the Japanese during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> started out as a US Army lieutenant. By the end of the war, he had been promoted to major (via radio messages) but was effectively in charge of far more men than a major would normally command, spread throughout the islands. To facilitate this, he field/brevet-promoted men to be in charge of various cells, areas and islands. Since some of these were commanding hundreds or even thousands of irregular troops, he gave out acting promotions higher even than his own substantive rank of major. Luckily, General MacArthur was understanding.
</li><li> Averted in militaries that don't have the rigid correspondence between rank and position, such as Russian Army in all its instances. There, the officer in command simply stays in his rank and continues to command his unit until the wheels of military bureaucracy turns and he gets actual promotion. During WWII there were Red Army majors that commanded <em>divisions</em>. Yeah, right, <em>majors</em>, not major-<em>generals</em>. If a division was commanded by a colonel, they didn't even bother to promote him.
</li><li> George Armstrong Custer was breveted from Lieutenant to Brigadier General during the Civil War, though would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">end his career</a> as a Colonel.
<ul><li> This happened a lot in the Civil War, because the Union Army was vastly larger than the Regular US Army before and after the war. Many career officers who lived through the war held high brevet rank that disappeared in 1865. (Similar to the AUS example below.) "Fighting Joe" Hooker, for example, was a substantive major in the US Army at the same time that he was a major general of volunteers in command of the Army of the Potomac.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy">Audie Murphy</a> started as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">underaged</a> private, and was field promoted to Sergeant and later Lieutenant in a combination of his heroic actions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">You Are in Command Now</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Dick Winters</a> started as a 2nd lieutenant. By the end of the war, he was <em>Major</em> Dick Winters. At least one of his promotions was a field promotion (1st Lieutenant to Captain).
<ul><li> Many of the men of Easy Company were promoted multiple times during the war. Special mention also goes to Carwood Lipton, who jumped into Normandy as a Sergeant, later became company First Sergeant (after the previous First Sergeant, James Diel, was battlefield commissioned to 2nd Lieutenant), and was given his own battlefield commission to 2nd Lieutenant after Bastogne.
</li></ul></li><li> A variation on this trope is the <a class="urllink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Army_of_the_United_States">Army of the United States<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the conscript (read: draft) force of the United States. When activated (thus far, it has only happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>), many of the officers are initially drawn from the regular Army and the Reserves, where they receive promotions to deal with the increased number of men they will be leading. Once the war ends, and the AUS is stood down, the officers go back to their previous jobs... and their previous ranks, since the Army of the United States is a separate organization from the Regular Army and the Army Reserves. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gubo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gubo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gubo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, depending on how long they were serving in the AUS, they may have received promotions in the Regular Army anyways, though not necessarily to the level where they served in the AUS).</span>
</li><li> Though this is not technically a field promotion, Nathaniel Green was promoted from private directly to the rank of general (GENERAL) during the Revolutionary War. It makes sense then that he had several failures in this new position before he actually started to achieve victories.
</li><li> Peter Ratcliffe, Regimental Sergeant-Major of the SAS during Operation Desert Storm, was promoted from RSM all the way to Major in one go in recognition of his actions in commanding a large SAS taskforce operating behind Iraqi lines. Slightly unusual in that the formal promotion didn't actually happen until some time <em>after</em> he ended up in charge of said taskforce. It was the first time in British military history that an officer was <em>formally</em> relieved of duty by an enlisted man, which tells you everything you need to know about said officer's competence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyStewart">Jimmy Stewart</a> joined the USAAF and started as a private, but because of his education and expert flying skills and experience, he became a pilot. He flew full tour of duty on bombers, rising to Squadron Commander and eventually reached the rank of full Colonel, one of only four men to do so during the war. The only reason he wasn't assigned a Group to command was that the war ended. He was promoted to Brigadier General by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the German army at Stalingrad deep in the USSR was completely surrounded and without ammunition or food. Rather than grant permission to surrender, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Hitler</a> promoted (by radio) a generous amount of officers to higher ranks to boost their morale, including the commander General Paulus to rank of Field Marshal (the highest military rank). No Field Marshal in German military history to that point had ever surrendered: the promotion was a signal that Hitler wanted him to commit suicide rather than surrender. Paulus defied him and chose to surrender to the Soviets.
</li><li> Lauri Törni, alias Larry Thorne, in <em>three</em> armies. He started as conscripted Private in the Finnish army, was made NCO in the Winter War, and later Captain. When Finland made peace with the USSR near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Törni defected to German Army, started as Schütze (Private) and soon rose to Hauptmann (Captain), <em>in less than one year</em>. After the war he moved to USA, where he joined the Army as a Private. Soon his skills were noted, and he was transferred to Special Forces. He participated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, where he eventually made Major. He was killed in action, and is buried at Arlington Cemetery.
