</p><p>If, for example, a movie features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a>, identifying their party might make a political statement that the writer does not intend to make.

It may simply be a lack of commitment on the writer's part — the character might espouse views from both sides. In any case, it avoids unnecessarily offending a large portion of the audience.
</p><p>It sometimes stretches credibility, but sometimes not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real-life</a> politicians in the US often say "Smith for Congress" without mentioning party affiliation, but in Britain campaigns often give the party name, e.g. "Vote Labour/Conservative - vote <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(politician)">John Smith"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (OK in that case you're voting Labour). Some ballot papers don't name the candidates' parties, as in Britain until 1968, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/virginia-ballots-skimp-on-party-id/2011/10/21/gIQAHYuuGM_story.html">some US elections today.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Populist regimes usually put the emphasis on their political leader rather than the party, and when he's not running personally they use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisingByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisingByAssociation">Advertising by Association</a> on their candidates.

<ul><li> Senator Robert Kelly in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics. He is canonically from New York, which usually elects Democrats, but his party allegiance is not explicitly stated. The issue is skirted and it falls on the writer of the story to make a hinted alignment. However, seeing as how he is opposed to issues not present in our real world as his only defining political characteristic, it mostly boils down to rhetoric a party would use to justify the reason for the registration.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em> identifies the political parties of the future USA as merely "Ruling" or "Opposition." There is one slip-up, however, when the Smiler, a California senator, is listed as "D-Cal." Because Callahan is compared to Robert Kennedy at one point, and his opponent is an obvious Richard Nixon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a>, the implications are clear that Callahan is a Democrat. While the voting map shows Callahan states as red, the comic was written just a few years before blue become solidified as the color of Democrats.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ExMachina">Ex Machina</a></em> has Mitchell Hundred running as Independent candidate for Mayor of New York City. His social policies lean left and his economic policies lean right, making him something of a libertarian. In the final issue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he joins John McCain's Republican ticket as Vice-President</span>.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></em> storyline, a news report announces that a senator (who is secretly working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a>) has left his party to become an independent presidential candidate, without actually saying what his party <em>was</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08zjs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08zjs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08zjs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">right-wing populist rhetoric</a>, it's easy to make an educated guess.</span>
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> ran for (and won) the presidency, he did it as a third party candidate, representing "The Tomorrow Party". But even then, DC was very, <em>very</em> careful to not say exactly what his political leanings were to one side or the other.
</li><li> DC were careful in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001">Armageddon 2001</a></em> annuals (which came out in 1991) to not say which party President Clark Kent represented. (He beat a Supreme Court challenge over "native born American" because his then-current origin story had him born from a gestation chamber on American soil.)
</li><li> Dylan/USA Patriot Act and Jenny/American Eagle, two of the pupils at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238">PS238</a></em> School for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">meta-prodigies</a>, are candidates from opposing parties to replace the aging Freedom Fighter (the PS238-verse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>). Their parties are, however, never named, and since they both sprout the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">patriotic platitudes</a> it is difficult to tell who is who.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://ps238.nodwick.com/comic/10032007/">However, Dylan's favorite color is red and Jenny's is blue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The other time you can actually tell their politics apart is when they light directly into each other, when Dylan will call Jenny a pinko commie and she responds by calling him a backwards neanderthal (or something of the sort). Their positions on firefighting services also align with a Dem Jenny and Rep Dylan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">Dylan's code name</a> might also be telling.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The RPG supplement</a> later confirmed that Jenny is the Democratic candidate and Dylan the Republican one.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the main villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson">Crimson</a></em> is a US senator and secretly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireMonarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireMonarch">a powerful vampire lord</a> running for President, yet he runs as an independent with his political leanings not being mentioned. In his own words, being a vampire transcends any notion of human identity politics, so its inapplicable to classify him as either conservative or progressive.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Deliberately invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/UltimateSleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/UltimateSleepwalker">Ultimate Sleepwalker: The New Dreams</a></em>, which specifically notes that Senator Robert Kelly got elected as an Independent candidate, bankrolled by the anti-mutant movement. J. Jonah Jameson's crusading journalism has given his Democratic <strong>and</strong> Republican opponents plenty of ammunition in their quest to regain Kelly's Senate seat.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Film </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdviseAndConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdviseAndConsent">Advise &amp; Consent</a></em> makes constant references to the President's party and the opposition, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and even mentions Republicans and Democrats when explaining seating in the Senate, but doesn't say who belongs to which party.
</li><li> From the same era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a>'s <em>The Best Man</em>, though context clues make it pretty clear the protagonists are Democrats.
</li><li> <em>Black Sheep</em> identified the party of neither Farley's brother nor the incumbent opponent.
<ul><li> Likewise, speeches given by both candidates were so vague and filled with meaningless phrases that it was impossible to even guess at either one's party affiliation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeadOfState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeadOfState">Head of State</a></em> goes out of its way not to say which side has nominated Rock's character for the presidency, partly by giving his opponents traits that would work for either party. Among other things, it's mentioned his opponent has been Vice President for 8 years which, since the movie came out in 2004, clears up nothing.
<ul><li> Rock's former position of being a DC Alderman would strongly imply that he's a Democrat, or an independent, since the Democrats aren't allowed by law to control every seat on DC Council. At the same time, however, his opponent being a cousin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone">Sharon Stone</a>, who is an active Democrat, is repeatedly mentioned as a positive trait, which would imply <em>he's</em> a Democrat. His repeated emphasis on having been Vice President for 8 years suggests that he's a send-up of Al Gore, but the timing of the film's release (i.e. in the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a>'s first term) muddles that quite a bit.
</li><li> California, a state with a <em>heavy</em> Democratic lean, is considered competitive for both Lewis and Mays, to the point where it's too close to call until the very last minute. Members of both parties are known to do well in state-level elections, and the race is said to mostly hinge upon whose supporters turn out the most.
</li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in which a member of Mays' party repeatedly says that he's supporting "big buisness." This is normally associated with Republicans in popular media, but it would really depend more upon what industry he's in. The same is true of Lewis, who is said to have "connections with the energy industry."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork">Escape from New York</a></em>, the President's political party is never mentioned or indicated. There's no mention of his political positions: he's just an uncaring self-absorbed bastard. Though given the film takes place after a nuclear war and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeAmerican">he has an English accent</a>... the question may well be academic in this case.
<ul><li> The President in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA">Escape from L.A.</a></em>, however, is very obviously a Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Political</a>, as an extreme example of the Religious Right. For example, he orders that all atheists be sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Los Angeles</a>, as well as all prostitutes, and any and all criminals; sex outside of marriage is outright illegal; alcohol is also illegal (teetotalism being a common position in certain Protestant denominations).
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2004 remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate">The Manchurian Candidate</a></em>, the political party involved is never mentioned by name, even during a scene that revolves around a strategy session involving the electoral map. However, it can sort of be inferred from the states that they are mentioned as "traditional weak" and "traditional strong" in that Senator Shaw and her son are Democrats.
<ul><li> This contrasts with the original, which made them a family of Republicans.
</li><li> Although even this has an alternate universe spin on it: the political parties have alternate names in the 2004 version if you pay close enough attention. There's one scene where Senator Shaw's opponent is referred to as "the Conservative nominee", indicating that in the universe of the 2004 movie, the Republicans are instead referred to as the Conservative Party, and implying that the Democrats—and thus the Shaws—are instead referred to as the Liberal Party. The writer's choice to change the party names is definitely a somewhat unusual example.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateOfPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateOfPlay">the movie adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StateOfPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StateOfPlay">State of Play</a></em>, Ben Affleck's character is a congressman whose political party is not mentioned, although he has a painting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> in his office. That probably isn't as big a hint as you might think, as Affleck's character is a former military man (Eisenhower is revered by military members regardless of party, and was actually a moderate himself) who went into politics. And he's from Pennsylvania, which is typically a swing state.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> movie <em>My Date with the President's Daughter</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dave">Dave</a></em>, where Kevin Kline plays both a U.S. President and an impersonator of the same, never mentions a political party. Only a cameo by known Republican Ben Stein (although not even his party is actually mentioned) as himself can allow parties to be indirectly determined.

</li><li> President Whitmore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em> has no identified political party. We know he's a Gulf War fighter ace, and a brief reference to a failed "crime bill" is made, but otherwise all we know is that he wants to kick some alien ass.
<ul><li> The novelization states that he beat a Republican in the election, which makes it likely than not that he's a Democrat. Then again, in the movie itself, Jasmine mentions that she voted for Whitmore's opponent; Jasmine is an African-American woman from Los Angeles, which puts her in various Democratic-leaning demographics, which could indicate Whitmore's being a Republican (either that, or Jasmine being a Republican).

</li><li> Senator Robert Kelly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a>. His party is not explicitly stated, and there is evidence on both sides. In the first film, he implies that he is for gun control (a Democratic position) for the same reasons he is pro-mutant registration. ("There is no difference!" he says, "All I see is weapons in our schools!") A deleted scene in the second film implies, by a newspaper clip about a speech that he gives and the Democrats had a response to his speech, that he is a Republican. However, seeing as how he is opposed to issues not present in our real world as his only defining political characteristic, it mostly boils down to rhetoric a party would use to justify the reason for the registration.
<ul><li> In the "Making Of" featurette of the first movie, called "Mutant Watch", he is given the suffix R-KS, which means that he is a Republican from Kansas. However, "Mutant Watch" had a, um, <em>surprise ending</em> that was most definitely NOT canon, so it's questionable how much any other detail can be relied on.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, presidential candidate David Palmer is referred to as a Democrat in Season 1. His opponent in the general election (not the party primaries), John Keeler, is presumably a Republican, yet he is never explicitly referred to as such, is endorsed by the very left-leaning AFL-CIO, and had a campaign logo presciently similar to the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real-life</a> Kerry-Edwards 2004 logo. Wayne Palmer, who becomes President in season 6, is presumably a Democrat like his brother, yet has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">strawman conservatives</a> as his Vice President and Chief of Staff.
<ul><li> In Season 7, President Allison Taylor is not explicitly identified by party (at least so far). Since her predecessor is presumably Democrat, she is presumably Republican - and yet her idealism tends to be more of a liberal trait, and her predecessor appears to have mostly GOP traits.
<ul><li> It could be resolved if one assumes that Keeler is a Democrat and that his election against Palmer was a primary election. Consider that, from what we know of Palmer, he seems to be a very moderate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">JFK</a>-style Democrat, which nowadays could theoretically open him up to a primary challenge from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Early in Season One, as Palmer visits a school on the campaign trail, we very briefly see hints that a teacher—and the teacher's union—are disgruntled with Palmer's stance on education, with the exact dialogue implying that Palmer is for merit pay and other measures opposed by the teacher's union, thus making him at least somewhat conservative on that issue. Also consider that in the debate between Palmer and Keeler, we see Keeler railing against free trade agreements that Palmer has signed, thus putting Keeler to the left of Palmer on that issue. And of course, there's the fact that when it comes to homeland security and defense issues, Palmer is seen taking stances that Jack and many real life conservatives tend to agree with. All in all, it makes it possible that Keeler is a more left-wing Democrat challenging Palmer in the primary. This would make Logan, and possibly Taylor, Democrats as well.
</li><li> There's another theory that Keeler and Logan are Republicans, but that <em>Wayne</em> Palmer is a Republican as well, unlike his Democratic brother. This would explain why his Cabinet is staffed by neoconservatives, and would thus make Taylor a Democrat. As for the plausibility of this, not all members of the same family necessarily are from the same party. And considering that David Palmer was implied to be a very moderate Democrat, his brother Wayne being a moderate Republican is certainly not impossible.
</li></ul></li><li> Alistair Davies, the UK Prime Minister in <em>Live Another Day</em> is of an unspecified party, as later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Arguably lampshaded by the entire short-lived series "Mr. Sterling", in which Josh Brolin's character (a prison teacher) is assumed to be a Democrat when he is appointed to finish the term of a Democratic Senator, but declares himself an independent. (In real life a freshman independent, appointed to fill a term, would be a political cipher, but Sterling ends up getting appointed to key committees almost immediately, presumably because a show about a Senator with no power at all would be pretty boring.)
</li><li> Jim Hacker, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em>, had Conservative views as well as looking and acting very much like the stereotypical Conservative MP, but was not identified as such. His party HQ was called "Central House", an amalgam of Central Office and Transport House, the locations of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party in real life at that time. In fact, many of the plot points in <em>Yes Minister</em> are based on real incidents, but they occurred under both Conservative and Labour ministries.
<ul><li> On one occasion, in fact, Hacker is heard musing on what the Conservative or Labour parties would do in a similar situation, implying he is neither.
</li><li> Hacker is also seen wearing a white rosette as the election results are read out at the start of the pilot episode Open Government, alongside others wearing blue (Conservative) and red (Labour) rosettes.
</li><li> This is actually part of the point of the show—that regardless of party and ideology, the elected leaders are hamstrung by the career bureaucrats (who, for their own part, may honestly believe that they serve the people best by preventing well-intentioned politicians from gumming up the works).
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"The Opposition aren't really the Opposition. They're just called the Opposition. But in fact they are the Opposition in exile. The Civil Service are the Opposition in residence."</em>

</li></ul></li><li> Governor Gatling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson">Benson</a></em> only ever refers to his party as "The Party". For that matter, we're never even told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">what state he's the governor of.</a>
</li><li> Harriet Jones from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> repeatedly introduces herself as "MP for Flydale North" without ever mentioning what party she represents. Certain clues have led fans to believe she belongs to either the Labour (the reference to "the babes" in "Aliens of London", and that her predecessor was played by an extra who was meant to be a Tony Blair lookalike) or Conservative (the Margaret Thatcher allegory in "The Christmas Invasion").
<ul><li> Nicely averted with the third series with the Master, who was an "independent candidate" who attracted a coalition of MPs from all the parties. Didn't matter much in the end, though: he was using mind control to get elected. He was apparently not even an MP, and several private citizens from different areas mention having voted for him; those aren't just unlikely, they're actually <em>impossible</em> without major changes to Britain's government structure.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03iqu');"><sup> * </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03iqu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03iqu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They might have meant they voted for the candidate representing him in their constituency.</span>

His party and political views are never discussed. The show also makes a much bigger deal out of a congressional election than is typical of real life.

Except, unlike Kelly, he's in a world with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> in force, so he can't have official policies based on that...
</li><li> Subtle hints indicate that he is a Republican, particularly the fact that his campaign is based on "family values", which at the time was a phrase more vocally used by Republicans.
</li><li> Tracy Strauss, a political consultant and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlondeRepublicanSexKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlondeRepublicanSexKitten">Blonde Maybe Republican Sex Kitten</a> would also fit this trope. She says that her boss, the governor of New York, has trouble with the far right but that does not rule out him being a Republican. The fact that he bothers trying to appeal to the far right at all may indicate that he is a Republican. She is likely of the same party as Nathan Petrelli as she helped him become a Senator.

While there is the occasional snide comment about certain political groups (usually, but not always, aimed at conservative groups/issues), rarely is a specific political party mentioned. There are, however, plenty of obvious knock-offs of famous politicians and pundits, thus allowing the viewer to draw what conclusions they will.
<ul><li> Although it has to be said that during Fred Thompson's run as the DA, he expressed plenty of conservative points that are not unlike his actual party (GOP). For example, he parroted Scalia's view that there is no ingrained constitutional right to privacy, a very GOP/originalist view. (For those who are not American, the actor was actually in his last year as a Republican Senator from Tennessee when he was cast and left the show to run for President.) Jack McCoy is more or less ambiguous and would do anything to win his case (one time he succeeded to nullify all gay marriages to try to break spousal confidentiality of a suspect, mirroring the time when the mayor of a small town upstate was issuing licenses for same sex marriage). On the other hand, Jack McCoy has, at the end of the day, expressed liberal positions on most issues not relating directly to criminal justice (and even some that do).
</li><li> A season one episode had D.A. Adam Schiff and A.D.A. Ben Stone attending a Democratic fundraiser. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2867h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2867h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2867h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Funnily enough, Adam Schiff is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">the name of the current democratic chair of the House Intelligence committee</a> who got his start as a local prosecutor. </span>

Though Frasier and Niles' man is a "bleeding-heart" who supports the NEA and protecting the environment, and Marty's is tough on crime and pro-military and family values, the words "Democrat" and "Republican" (or "liberal" or "conservative") are not mentioned. Of course, one or both could be an independent or third-party candidates.
<ul><li> Notably, this contrasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>'s own political affiliation, and that of his most vocally (straw) political character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Sideshow Bob</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt">The Thick of It</a></em> simply has "The Party" and "The Opposition", but it isn't hard to guess who their real-life equivalents are (Labour and the Tories, respectively). The last series added the "Coalition Partners" (partners to the abovementioned Opposition, who are now in power). They are clearly the Liberal Democrats.
</li><li> The titular Vice President s, Selina Meyer, party on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Veep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Veep">Veep</a></em> is never stated outright but shes heavily implied to be a Democrat based on her various beliefs and opponents in elections. It also comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmandoIannucci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmandoIannucci">Armando Iannucci</a>s tendency to riff on the party that is currently in charge (in this case, Obama's Democratic administration). Some examples:
<ul><li> Shes pro-choice (Democratic position) and doesnt know how to react when the president suddenly changes his mind from being pro-choice to not.
</li><li> She's a former senator from Maryland which hasn't had a Republican senator since the 80s.
</li><li> She fights with the party about including universal childcare in her platform when she runs for president, which is a bit of a hobby horse for Democratic women in government. Her opponent in the election is a senator from Arizona (who only had Republican senators between 1988-2018) and runs on a border wall which is what Donald Trump ran on in 2016. Even though his Vice Presidential nominee who ends up becoming President (due to the electoral college being tied) is a senator from a blue state, New Mexico.
</li><li> When she runs for president, the states she wins are marked in blue and are actual states that would vote for a Democrat for president.

In theory these did not correspond to the Conservative or Labour parties, and mostly sticking to satirizing the political process in general. In practice, Jeremy couldn't resist his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> impression, and some female teammates played up to the "Blair Babes" stereotype.

When she ends up assuming the presidency after the current president dies, this is brought up as a subject of disquiet more than her gender is. She canonically started out as a moderate, New England-style Republican (flashbacks in the Pilot episode show the Connecticut Republican Party recruiting her to run for Congress and she became the arch-conservative President Bridges's running mate because he needed a moderate Republican to balance the ticket). After this, though, she officially became an Independent.

</li><li> A major plot in an early season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> was a Senate race between Jonathan Kent and Lex Luthor.

On Liz's advice he refuses to concede and successfully runs for reelection as an independent against two candidates of likewise identified parties. Not even election night coverage gives any clues: states Dalton wins are marked in orange, while his opponents to right and left use purple and green, respectively.

<ul><li> Similarly, Nebraska's unicameral legislature is non-partisan—although usually, everyone knows how the members lean.
</li><li> Many states in the US have elected or partially elected judiciaries—i.e. judges on at least some state courts have fixed terms and must seek election/reelection to win/keep office. In some states these elections are partisan, and in other states these elections are "retention" elections (i.e. "should we keep this judge who has been appointed" rather than "who should be judge"), but 10-20 states (depending on which kind of court we're talking about) have officially nonpartisan contested elections—but again, usually everyone knows which way the members lean and in some states (e.g. Michigan and Ohio), parties actively endorse the nonpartisan judicial candidates.
</li><li> The first President of the United States of America, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, is the only president not to belong to any political party. In fact, he was strongly against political parties and used his farewell address to warn against introducing factions into government. Of course, this didn't stop the very next presidential election to be waged against the first American political parties, the Federalists and Antifederalists.
</li><li> Candidates for American legislative offices occasionally do get elected without party backing, in which case their affiliation is listed as "Independent". This is complicated by the fact there actually is a political party called the Independent party which does try to have influence in local politics.
</li><li> In some states, local offices like Mayors, City Council, and Park District are officially non-partisan. However, in some cases, the party affiliation is an open secret.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in Mexico: While legally anyone can be elected in any elective office position, in practice only members of a political party can be elected in any position. Many NGO's have asked for years to change the laws to similar ones used in the U.S., even though <em>Washington was the only American president that was not a member of a political party.</em>
</li><li> Averted in Costa Rica to an extreme; the electoral law actually <strong>forbids</strong> independent candidates. By law no one can be elected to any office without the nomination from a political party. This however is since 1949, between 1821 (the independence from Spain) and 1889 <em>all</em> Costa Rican presidents were independents as the first political parties were founded in 1889.
</li><li> Also averted to the extreme in Israel.

How each party selects its Knesset candidate varies by party, ranging from open primaries across the party membership (e.g. Labor) to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">being hand-picked by a council of Rabbis</a></em> (the Ultra-orthodox parties).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Jack Ryan</a>, from the Tom Clancy novel series, is explicitly described as an independent, though he clearly holds policies that mark him as a very conservative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>.
<ul><li> Ed Kealty comes close, but it's quite clear that he's nothing more than an amoral, conniving man who's politics only matter in which of Ryan's statements he twists to meet his needs. Durling, while obviously a liberal (as he is Fowler's VP. a character who is clearly in opposition to Ryan's conservatism) is clearly respected by Ryan and returns that respect. Fowler himself is shown as a good man, with very cogent arguments against Ryan's politics and views, his treatment of Ryan bordering on persecution is clearly shown as being caused, not by political differences, but because of misinformation and distortion of the man by Liz Elliot, who maintains a vendetta against him up until her complete breakdown after Denver got nuked. As for Ryan himself, he's very conservative, and something of a Gary Stu, but his views very much resemble real-world ones, if somewhat simplified for plot reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker">Rudy Rucker</a>'s novel <em>Mathematicians In Love</em> is a rare example of someone bothering to change the names of the parties—"Heritagist" and "Common Ground"—while still making it very, very obvious that he's talking about real-life politics. (The Heritagists are a party of closed-minded conservatives who are rampantly curtailing civil liberties and have just gotten done wrecking the country through a disastrous war in the Middle East. The Common Ground party is a party that's just gotten done running a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry">completely uncharismatic war veteran</a> against the Heritagists and utterly failing to unseat them, causing a wave of despair among liberals determined to abandon the country and move to Canada.)
</li><li> A pretty surprising aversion comes from the children's novel <em>My Mother The Mayor, Maybe</em>, where the protagonist's mother is clearly stated to be a Democrat and the race is quite partisan, even though as a small town mayoral election it wouldn't be surprising at all for the election to be non-partisan. This is done primarily to play up the underdog element as the campaign is in a supposedly heavily Republican town, though it also takes a clear stance on the issues discussed as well, not something to be expected in a book for the middle school set.
</li><li> The original novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdviseAndConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdviseAndConsent">Advise &amp; Consent</a></em> very sneakily averts this by keeping the party affiliations of characters ambiguous except for Senator Seab Cooley, who's mentioned in passing to having been first elected to the House of Representatives on the same platform as Woodrow Wilson. This makes him, the Senate Majority members, and the President Democrats and the Senate Minority members Republicans.
</li><li> In the <em>Royally ____</em> series of YA romantic comedies, the main character is an American teenager in a love triangle with a European prince, and the US President's son. Since some of her conflict involves disagreement with that President's conservative politics (regarding LGBT issues and premarital sex), it can be assumed that the President is a republican. (The European prince, on the other hand, has no issues with these things.)
</li><li> Near-future military thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> averts this, yet manages to do it in a generally non-partisan manner. President Cisneros is explicitly identified as a Democrat, while his successor President Warner is a Republican—but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">both administrations are more or less equally corrupt</a>, without any narrative favoritism either way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy">WWW Trilogy</a></em>: Averted-the US President is mentioned as being a Democrat. He's also clearly meant to be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> or at least an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> where Bartlet is very clearly a Democrat.
<ul><li> As was Andrew Shepherd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">before him</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmericanPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmericanPresident">The American President</a></em>.
</li><li> Pretty much everyone in the West Wing is clearly of one party or the other (or at least could be classed as conservative or liberal). The sole exceptions seem to be people associated with the military or national security: when the West Wing staff are briefly considering replacing John Hoynes with Admiral Fitzwallace, either Ed or Larry asks if Fitzwallace is even a Democrat. Later in the series, Will is shocked to learn that Kate Harper, who had expressed occasional liberal values throughout her run, had voted for Vinick, the Republican candidate. Since both Fitzwallace and Kate got their jobs thanks to their experience in the Navy, their political views on nonmilitary issues are somewhat moot. Nancy McNally is similarly vague in her political persuasion.
</li></ul></li><li> Sneakily averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain">Little Britain</a> sketches featuring Anthony Stewart Head as the Prime Minister. While his party affiliation is never <em>explicitly</em> revealed, there are enough clues given to make it blindingly clear that he's Labour - he wears a red tie while the Leader of the Opposition wears a blue one, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer is very obviously based on Gordon Brown (the Prime Minister himself is more loosely based on Tony Blair).
</li><li> Alan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">B'stard</a> in the <em>The New Statesman</em> just <em>had</em> to be a Conservative.

</li><li> And in a 2011 No2AV advert, he was an obvious parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg">Nick Clegg</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise Francis Urquhart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUK">House of Cards (UK)</a></em>, though not in the original book.

</li><li> Hybridised in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingMrsPritchard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingMrsPritchard">The Amazing Mrs Pritchard</a>, where Ros Pritchard forms the Purple Democratic Alliance out of dissatisfaction with both Labour and the Conservatives after they start a fistfight outside her supermarket (purple = Labour red + Conservative blue, of course), pinching members from both parties in the process. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>, Lib Dems! (She persuades a Lib Dem to defect, too.)
</li><li> All three Presidents in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFellowAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFellowAmericans">My Fellow Americans</a></em> are identified as either Democrat or Republican in the opening scenes.
</li><li> Despite being a legal and not a political drama, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></em> manages to avert this: Guthrie Featherstone is a Labour (implied) MP who later (explicitly) joins the SDP, Rumpole's third client in the series is a Labour backbencher, Charles Hearthstoke self-identifies as a Tory, and Liz Probert...well...let's just say that her father's name is "Red" Ron Probert, shall we? Rumpole himself doesn't clearly have a party affiliation, but, iconoclast and sympathizer with the poor that he is, it would appear that he's somewhere on the left (likely voting Labour at the beginning of the series in 1967 and voting Liberal Democrat by the end in 1992).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em> makes no secret that the central characters are all Democrats. The show is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>/ Cook County, Illinois and getting elected there as anything <em>but</em> a Democrat is practically impossible. To quantify how tough it is to win there as a Republican, Democrats control 48/50 seats in the Chicago city council and 15/17 of Cook County comissioners. There are several exceptions among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recurrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recurrer">recurrers</a>, and the series notably avoids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Politicals</a> in either direction, with people of all viewpoints having about even odds to be sympathetic or corrupt.
