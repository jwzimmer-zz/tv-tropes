<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, Levi at one point tells a dying soldier that he fought well and helped buy time. This may or may not have been a lie, but the man seems to relax as he dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Light's father Soichiro, the lead Japanese investigator in the Kira case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies happily convinced that his son isn't Kira.

<ul><li> However, in the live-action movies, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he lives to know the truth.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Maya and Makoto meet their ends in "End of Evangelion" by bursting into LCL while being embraced by illusions of their unrequited crushes, Ritsuko and Misato, respectively.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em>, when Tot is stabbed to almost death by Farfarello and a grieving Nagi uses his telekinesis to crash the whole mansion where this happened, the Weiss guys look at their dying enemies sadly, link their hands together and leave. It later turns out they're not dead, but the others won't find out for a long time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>. Nausicaa does this for a girl fatally injured when the airship on which she was a hostage is attacked by insects and crashes. The girl (a foreign princess) begs Nausicaa to make sure the cargo (a devastating weapon) is destroyed. Nausicaa assures her that everything is burning, nothing is left. The girl dies smiling, her last words, "Thank God."
<ul><li> Perhaps not played entirely straight since Nausicaa did believe that everything was destroyed. She just doesn't find out until later that the cargo survived the fire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Suzaku tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Euphemia</span> that her plan to give the Japanese their freedom was a success; what she doesn't remember is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was the victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> that made her go on a genocidal rampage against the people she had sought to help.</span>
</li><li> In the second season, when the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Black Knights betray</span> Lelouch, Rolo rescues him, using his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geass</span> so much that it overtaxes his body. As Rolo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies, Lelouch asks why he did it, especially considering that Lelouch had raged at Rolo earlier for the events of the previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>; Rolo responds, "I knew you were lying. You really do care about me, don't you, brother?" With a sad smile on his face, Lelouch says that he does, and Rolo dies.</span>
</li><li> Averted when Lelouch coldly refuses the final request of a dying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deithard</span> who asks to experience the power of Lelouch's Geass, after Lelouch has his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Geassed half-brother Schneizel shoot point-blank his former number-one-fan, who was more willing to sell him out than even Ohgi.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yamamoto promises Rukia before her execution that he will allow Ichigo and his friends to return home unharmed, when he actually has no intention of doing this. This is subverted: mere minutes later, Ichigo shows up and rescues her.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BleachMemoriesOfNobody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BleachMemoriesOfNobody">Memories of Nobody</a></em>, as Senna is dying, she instructs Ichigo to take her to the graveyard in which she was buried to prove that she is actually a real person who was alive, and not just a collection of memories. Unable to see, she asks Ichigo to tell her if her name is written on the tombstone. The tombstone is so weathered the name can no longer be read, but Ichigo assures Senna that it's her name.
</li><li> Happens accidentally to Ulquiorra. During the Arrancar arcs, a large part of his character development was spent on him questioning what emotions, or a heart, are. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His final moments after pretty much seeing his plan go to hell are spent on him contemplating one of his more famous quotes. Reaching out to Orihime, he asks if she's afraid, and she replies that she isn't and reaches out to hold Ulquiorra's hand. There, it clicks and he realizes what a "heart" really is, and dies as happily as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> like him can.</span>
</li><li> When Byakuya is dying, Ichigo rushes to his side and Byakuya asks if Renji and Rukia are alive. Ichigo says they are, but hides the fact they're in terrible condition. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted: Byakuya lapses into a coma but doesn't die.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> anime, Ban Midou uses his Jagan on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> Takuma Fudou for the last time, giving Fudou the illusion that he and Ban are rapturously going at it, when in fact in reality Ban has actually already fatally wounded him and he's lying on the ground dying. The expression of sheer joy on his face when he finally dies (while he's still in the illusion) is akin to pure bliss.
<ul><li> In the manga, one of the first chapters has Ban and Ginji accepting a job from a poor old man to rescue his daughter who was taken by the mafia. After reaching her, she reveals that she has come to like the rich lifestyle of the mafia and betrays the two. After fighting their way out, Ban and Ginji return to the old man to report their failure only to discover that he had been mugged and brutally beaten. As the old man lay dying, Ban uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoticEyes">Hypnotic Eyes</a> to give him the illusion that his daughter came back to him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run</a></em>, Diego Brando is cut in half after he mortally wounded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Funny Valentine</a>. Knowing that he hit the killing blow before being run over by the train, Diego dies believing that he took Valentine down, too. However, unknown to Diego, Valentine had managed to break away to a parallel universe using Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyBackupDrive">passing on his Stand ability and motivations to a new Valentine before that body died</a>. As such, Diego's dying attack failed, and Valentine, in his new body, comes back to the main universe to continue his plan.
</li><li> Late in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, the Ptolemaios is destroyed while Lichty and Christina are inside. He shields her by embracing her, and as they float in the ruins of the ship, he dies happy, thinking that he protected her. After he dies, the camera pans to show a large piece of shrapnel embedded in Christina's spacesuit - she dies only moments later. It's important to note that this is an example because Christina assures him before hand that he succeeded. Not even the audience realizes the truth until the camera reveals she <em>was</em> already fatally wounded. Then, just to erase any doubt, the remains of the bridge explodes, consuming both of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, after he fatally injures Yumi, Shishio openly tells Kenshin that he understands her and has given her what she wanted (and Yumi herself confirms this, saying she <em>knew</em> this would happen but did so to stop being a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralFemale">Neutral Female</a>), then holds the dying Yumi in his arms as she expires declaring her loyalty and love for him. Technically subverted, since Shishio <em>did</em> care for Yumi... well, as much as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> like him could, anyway. And they're later seen together in Hell, so...
</li><li> Used by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> Dom towards Raalgon admiral Donan when later asks if the solar flare destroying his entire fleet got Tylor's <em>Soyokaze</em> as well. He tells him he got his revenge even though Tylor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">of course</a> survived.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em>, Saemon allows the dying Hotarubi to die believing he's her dead husband Yashamaru. Even more meaningful because <em>he</em> is the one who fatally mutilated her, as they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninjas</a> in a fatal feud and her clansmen were responsible for the loss of Saemon's little sister - and yet when the dying girl calls him by the name of her husband, he can't bring himself to say he's not the dead dude, and nods so she will die in peace.
</li><li> When John dies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a></em>, the group that finds him tells him that a thousand soldiers of Ohu have come to overpower Hougen's army. Hiro begs him to hang on for just five more minutes so that they can make Hougen bow down in submission at his paws. Unfortunately, John's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">never liked waiting for anything</a>, death included.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>: with the last bit of his strength, Roberto asks Johan to share with him the vision they have been working towards. Johan tells him that he can't see it. Ouch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>: During Bandou's final confrontation with Lucy in the manga, he ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">torn in half, and doesn't see if his bullet manages to hit Lucy or not.</span> He asks Nana and Mayu where she is - Nana is about to tell him the truth, but Mayu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">interrupts and tells him he'd finally killed her. He <em>seems</em> to die smiling, but he later returns in the final chapter with a prosthetic overhaul.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, during Brook's flashback, he first attempts to comfort his sick captain (who has ordered them to abandon him before more are infected) by promising that they'll meet again; Yorki does smile, but it's vague whether either of them believes it. Later, Brook tells his mortally wounded crew that they don't have to die with regrets, his own power will revive him after he dies and he'll fulfill the promise they all made to return to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Team Pet</a>. They die smiling. When Brook is revived, we see how unlikely a promise that really was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Vegeta is revived to fight Majin Buu, he is pissed at Goku for not using Super Saiyan 3 during their earlier fight, believing Goku to have been invoking this trope, tricking him into dying happy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">In addition, he could have used it to defeat him early on and probably stop Majin Buu's revival before it happened</a>.
</li><li> This is also averted during Vegeta's actual death in the same saga earlier on.

However, he dies before learning that he has bitten Aberline and cursed him as well. He could also be happy from realizing that since he was still alive to that point meant he had succeeded in defeating his father, meaning neither of them will hurt anyone again. However, this only makes the ending more tragic when we find out what becomes of Aberline.

Percy, however, can't resist very meanly bursting that bubble while Delacroix is sitting in the electric chair (after trying to burst it by <em>killing the mouse,</em> and would've been successful at this if not for John Coffey's healing touch). This, if anything, makes his actual execution, where he is quite literally fried alive because Percy had neglected to properly soak the sponge for proper electrical conduction as a means of "punishing" Del one last time, all the more horrific.
</li><li> Apart from Percy, this is a standard policy of the guards on Death Row. As Paul notes, keeping the inmates happy results in less muss and fuss when the day of execution finally arrives. The night before execution, Bitterbuck asks Paul if he feels that a man can enter Heaven if he truly feels sorry for what he's done; Paul replies in the affirmative, even though he's certain Bitterbuck is going to Hell for what he's done.

Given that the rest of the episode is about the Doctor getting too big for his britches and losing sight of the impact he has on the people around him, the latter answer stands out as a very notable probability.

Because the man is already dying, Gideon tries to stop him moving to minimize the pain he's experiencing, and repeatedly tells him "it's okay, it's okay", rather than commenting on the wrongness of his actions.

</li><li> Sadly averted in an earlier season episode. Dying from a combination of AIDS and a suicide attempt, a hallucinating woman keeps begging her husband to forgive her — she cheated on him, contracted the virus, and passed it on to him and their daughter. However, her angry and unforgiving husband isn't even there, it's one of the doctors she's talking to. He is unable to bring himself to say "I forgive you", whether because he himself is disgusted at her actions or simply feels it's unethical to deceive her.

Garak lies and says all of his enemies are dead, to which his father says that's good, since a man shouldn't let his enemies outlive him. This may even be the truth, since in his previous appearance he wiped out everyone but Garak and his housekeeper that even knew who he was.

In reality Oliver had killed him earlier in the episode. This is ultimately subverted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Malcolm somehow survived so Oliver is unknowingly telling the truth</span>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tommy:</strong> Did you kill my father?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Oliver:</strong> No.

The gang knocks her out and drags her away, but after the High Priestess is killed, the girl poisons herself rather than return to Atlantis. Her final words are that her father is "dead to her."

Jim humors the man, cutting his own hand and anointing the monk's face with blood.

When the orphans in her care learn that the recipient died a long time ago, they write a response in his stead and present it to the nun on her deathbed. She dies smiling, but it's implied that she knew the letter was a fake.
<ul><li> It is heavily implied, however, that the nun was the titular "Daughter of Evil" and the message was the one sent in "Regret Message". Seeing as the recipient was executed in front of her eyes and the message was sent out to the sea in a bottle, it is no wonder she knew it was fake.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It's not uncommon for family or friends to tell someone who is dying something they would want to hear, even if it's not true, or it's about something that might happen but hasn't yet. ESPN recently did an Outside the Lines story on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13612522">Dylan Rebeor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a high-school football player who discovered he had terminal colon cancer early in 2010. He served as an inspiration to his team, Central High School in Columbia, Tennessee, as they played through the 2010 season and state playoffs. He died the morning of the State Championship; his last words were to ask his mother if the team had won the title. She said they did, even though the game was that night. Fortunately, the team <em>did</em> win the state title.
</li><li> In the age of paternalistic medicine (which ended around the 1970s with the adoption of the concept of "informed consent" as the basis for patientphysician interactions), doctors would quite often not tell the patient that he or she has a fatal disease. The doctor would inform the family members first, assuming that they would know how to break the news better, but quite often, the family would not tell the patient, either. This was ostensibly done to not distress the patient; but unfortunately, being stuck in a limbo where everyone is lying to your face and whispering solemnly around your bed only made patients feel more afraid.
