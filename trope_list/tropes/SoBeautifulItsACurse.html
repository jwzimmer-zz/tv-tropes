When someone's beauty is all that many people see, the character may well grow distrustful and cynical of others, fear being stalked or taken advantage of, or harbor harmful and emotionally damaging beliefs about themselves and others, such as a belief that their only worth is in their looks, that looks are all people value in them, and/or that they will never be respected for their own personal merits or achievements not related to beauty.

<ul><li> Shiro is a delicate looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> and as such he occasionally garners unwanted attention for his good looks by men and women who want to enslave him and forcibly make him a prostitute. He also had to escape his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> position at Shinohome's hand.
</li><li> Kojiro, being majorly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome">Tall, Dark, and Handsome</a>, gets unwanted attention from men like Anri (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">unless its Shiro</a>) for his good looks as well.
</li><li> Anri is also a feminine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> and his good looks led to his troupe leader making him his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>.

Iason, in particular, made Riki his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> due to his looks and rebellious nature. And Guy is also Yandere for him.

While he does exploit his looks to his benefit, it has also led to much harassment. For example, there have been many times when his servants have left their 'underthings' in his drawers. Disgustingly, one even had pubic hair sewn into it.
</li><li> Hideyoshi Kinoshita in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">a guy so feminine-looking and beautiful</a> no one believes him to be a guy, and gets confessions from guys just about every day. Then there's the poem a certain someone wrote to him which kind of gave him nightmares for a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Casca certainly has shades of this in the Golden Age Arc, but it's even more prevalent after the Eclipse when she became insane. True to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">The Ophelia</a> ideal, Casca is now much more desirable with the added bonus of becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">innocent and (mostly) defenseless</a>. Since the Berserk-verse is very much a world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenAreRapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenAreRapists">everything with a dick has the high potential of being a scumbag rapist</a>, post Eclipse Casca is prime prey for a plethora of men AND monsters who want to have their way with her and basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">has to be protected 24/7</a>. Luca, Casca's one-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">kind-hearted prostitute</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker">caretaker</a>, is aware of this, and tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defy this outcome as best as she can</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandagedFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandagedFace">wrapping Casca's face in bandages</a> and passes her off as a victim of syphilis.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Griffith</a>, being quite beautiful for a man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">happens to attract the attention of not just women, but also other men</a>. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticGovernor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticGovernor">Governor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Gennon</a> is lewd enough to want to have sex with him, and Griffith begrudgingly does to fund the Band Of The Hawks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, it should be noted that Griffith tends to use his attractiveness to his advantage, rather than being outright taken advantage of.
</li><li> Guts himself actually has this problem as well despite many people fearing him and being quite terrifying when on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">rampage</a>. Guts has gotten a lot of unwanted sexual attention over the course of his life. Like Casca, he got bought as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> as a child when a pedophiliac mercenary named Donovan noticed him and asked Gambino — Guts' adoptive father — if he could have him for a night (Guts killed Donovan the next day as revenge for that, by the way). Things got worse for Guts as Griffith became attracted to him and refused to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">let him go</a> and went crazy when Guts eventually left. There's also Slan, the sole female member of the Godhand, who lusted after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> the moment she met him and even pursued him after the Eclipse, dragging him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Pocket Dimension</a> where she could molest him. And even Rosine, who seemed to be strictly into her friend Jill, flirted with him and called him hunky before attempting to kill him. Also, Farnese was attracted to the sight of his scarred muscular torso after giving him lashes, and had repressed sexual desire for him which was released and exacerbated upon after a demon from the group following Guts possessed her and made her undress and act overtly sexual towards him in an ominous manner. For a much less creepy example, when Guts attended a ball all decked out in formal attire with the rest of the Band Of the Hawks, he was surrounded at one point by a group of noblewomen who were in awe of him and his muscular handsome features. He quickly got fed up and went off to be by himself. He also has garnered crushes amongst many normal girls but as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">only has eyes for Casca</a> he is not interested. Its no wonder Guts has developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">Haphephobia</a>.

He also has guys hitting on him at school, with one bully calling him pretty and a male student saying he is very cute. Also, in both past and present lives, Sairi attempts multiple times to seduce Yuki even though s/he was quite in love with Luka. He's even gone to the point of trying to use his God's Eyes on her/him, though it never worked. He says he doesnt like boys except for Yuki who he openly declares love towards.

One of her teachers compares her to an equally beautiful woman she knew named Saskia, who killed herself, and says that because Yvienne's been able to get so much so easily with it, she doesn't know how to value anything and will eventually think of everything as being trivial. Yvienne herself even says, "Have you ever once heard of a really beautiful woman being happy?" However, at the same time, she knows that it's a very real benefit to her, and has no qualms about using it to her advantage whenever she has to, and almost all of her complaints about it are just made jokingly.

He is probably more pretty than a lot of the girls in the setting. Its said he had over 100 dates lined up for him at one point. This all is more a nuisance to him more than anything as his main goal in life is to save his sister. Its also implied Rolo became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> for him out of a growing attraction to his beloved brother.

Among the issues caused by being so beautiful is a band of thieves killing each other to be with her, and an elf chieftain fighting her and Jinguuji because she couldn't handle that there's a girl more beautiful than her.

When she sleeps, full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> hits and causes erotic dreams in anybody near by.

To that end, in her current school, she puts on glasses and wears her hair in braids to make herself look plainer, specifically to avoid such problems (although she's still considered gorgeous by her classmates - it's not like she makes any noticeable effort to hide how curvaceous she is, after all).

Invoked in the fourth episode where Tamaki is playing the role of himself but notably more humble; angsting about people idolizing him for his looks.

For example, every time she shows up late to school, everyone assumes its because she was sleeping around, whereas it's usually a more mundane reason such as staying up too late watching Television.

It's SUCH a sin, he constantly "repents" for it by allowing himself to be trampled by a bull called by his faithful servant. However, it turns out that he's so egotistical and so bizarre with his self-imposed punishments that everyone <strong>hates</strong> him and do everything they can to avoid him, and he's too obsessed with himself to see it.

</li><li> Akane initially. She had several dozen male classmates step up to Tatewaki Kunō's challenge of having to beat her to date her, and those may just have been the ones who continued to face her despite her violent defeats of them — there may have been even more to begin with, given her track record.

He eventually took to wearing a mask constantly in order to hide his face, and even the threat of having him take off his mask during court is enough to cause chaos; when he actually takes it off, it entrances anyone who looks at him and sends several men into hysterics.

</li><li> Usagi too has attracted a dark admirer in the form of Prince Demande who became infatuated with Neo Queen Serenity from the moment he saw her and went after Usagi because she was the queen's younger self.

It's notable that Ferid only drinks the blood of beautiful boys and girls.
</li><li> Aya Tojo <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent">Strawberry 100%</a></em> becomes better looking by letting her bangs down, and beautiful by taking off her glasses and unbraiding her hair. But she attracts the attention of the boys so much that even come from other classes to see her and is almost harrased by the gym teacher.
</li><li> The lead female character of the manga <em>Telepathic Wanderers</em> hates being beautiful because not only do most men she meets lust after her, but, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">psychic</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">unable to control her power</a>), she's forced to watch every fantasy a man has about her in her presence. (And, in keeping with what seems to be a theme with this trope, she also almost gets raped at one point in volume 1.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>:
<ul><li> The plot starts because Rize initially became enamored with Kaneki's good looks and pursued him with the intent to eat him.

</li><li> Tsukiyama is mentioned by Chie as "the type of guy who spends the whole day staring at himself in the mirror". And indeed Karren becomes jealous to an extreme extent out of her love for him and it's assumed this is partly due to his good looks.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> we have Sephie, the queen of Deviluke and mother of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Her beautiful appearance and voice allow her to affect the behaviour of other people, but she wears a veil around other people apparently if someone would see her uncovered face they would turn into a Beast. The only two people to see her uncovered face without immediately molesting her are her future husband Gid (who was at the time so much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> she resorted to throwing herself on him to communicate her interest) and Rito (who is incredibly chaste and unfailingly dedicated to his crush despite a notorious reputation as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Pervert</a>).

</li><li> While Kyohei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a></em> never says anything to the likes of this, he certainly fits the trope. He can't hold a job thanks to constant sexual harassment, he's had a slew of stalkers that eventually drove his family to kick him out, he used to have to be escorted to school to avoid being attacked, it was implied that he had been raped several times by many strangers as a grade-schooler and there was even one time where he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesBondage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesBondage">kidnapped</a> off the street by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostClub">Host Club</a> for the purpose of selling him to the highest bidder as a sexual slave.

One story focuses on the "most beautiful princess in the world" who was so attractive that it made everyone who sees her jealous on the spot and as a result despise her, including males, her own reflection in the mirror and forces of nature. The story presents the princess as being quite miserable with her "stigma" and was abandoned by everyone for being so unhumanly pretty they couldn't comprehend it. It's worth noting that her face is never directly shown, leaving her looks to the readers' imagination (as well as not turning the readers against her if the power of her beauty was, in fact, accurate).

The only males who <em>don't</em> have this reaction are those she's actually quite attracted to. Which causes her to react similarly to her drooling, gawking male admirers, for great comic effect.

<div class="indent"><strong>Bishop:</strong> Does this not shock you, ladies! <br/><strong>Jocelyn:</strong> Sir, I only laugh, just to keep from weeping. <br/><strong>Bishop:</strong> Beauty is such a curse.

</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gohatto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gohatto">Gohatto</a></em>.

Earlier, she is even dumped by her long-time boyfriend for being too pretty to be a future President's wife.
</li><li> Justified in a dark and diseased way in <em>Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural</em>, where Lila Lee's beauty and angelic singing symbolize her budding sexuality, which in turn attract so much unwanted attention that nearly all males in the film <em>are</em> predatory monsters. The only exceptions are her father, who is taken out of the picture early, and her reverend, who is clearly struggling with his feelings towards her.

When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Malèna has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being.
</li><li> A slight variation is hilariously invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>. The high school girls have been building a trust exercise: they read out apologies for all the bitchy things they have done, then fall backwards to be caught by the other girls. The simultaneously vain and deeply insecure Gretchen Wieners actually utters the following 'apology' completely without irony (Needless to say the other girls do <em>not</em> all rush to catch her when she falls backwards):
<div class="indent"><em>"I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me... but I can't help it that I'm so popular."</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeonDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeonDemon">The Neon Demon</a></em> essentially revolves around this trope with the lead Jesse.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesOutOfMyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesOutOfMyLeague">She's Out of My League</a></em> features this trope mainly from the perspective of a not-very-attractive guy who has landed a very attractive girlfriend — she really digs him, but his own insecurities and the pettiness, jealousy, and spite of the people around him work to poison the relationship.

<div class="indent"><strong>Will Randall</strong>: You know, I think I understand what you're like now. You're very beautiful and you think men are only interested in you because you're beautiful, but you want them to be interested in you because you're you. The problem is, aside from all that beauty, you're not very interesting. You're rude, you're hostile, you're sullen, you're withdrawn. I know you want someone to look past all that at the real person underneath but the only reason anyone would bother to look past all that is because you're beautiful. Ironic, isn't it? In an odd way, you're your own problem.

It sadly causes discord between the Ludlow brothers - as she's to be the wife of Samuel, but both Tristan and Alfred lust after her as well. After Samuel's death, Tristan uses her for sex and then abandons her. The family ends up divided partially because of their attraction to Susannah. Notably before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing herself</span>, Susannah cuts some chunks out of her beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> - which has been interpreted to be an attack on the beauty that landed her in this situation. A deleted scene from the trailer even has the family patriarch blaming Susannah for the discord between the brothers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a></em>'s heroine Baby Doll has beauty that makes her look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">The Ingenue</a>, and that means Blue wants to rape her. Likewise, some of the other girls in the asylum are quite pretty but it's implied they too are sexually abused by Blue and his orderlies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave">12 Years a Slave</a></em> has Patsey, played for all the horror it's worth.

The worst that comes of it is a group of sisters offering money for a night with him, but it is heavily implied that worse could happen if his heavily armed sisters weren't close by.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog">Hurog</a></em> duology, this is implied with Oreg - Ward has some thoughts about what owning (Oreg is an immortal slave to the family) such a pretty boy might have meant to some of his ancestors. It never explicitly says that he's thinking of child molesters, but it is pretty clearly implied. And then there is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garannon, who was made the king's sex slave because of his beauty</span>.
</li><li> Played depressingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TessOfTheDUrbervilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TessOfTheDUrbervilles">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</a></em>. Tess is beautiful and her mother exploits that in hopes of winning a position in the household an aristocratic "cousin" who rapes her and leaves her to suffer in a society that defines by her impurity and probably blames her for it.
</li><li> A minor theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyEchoesRemain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyEchoesRemain">Only Echoes Remain</a></em>, which centers on Isa, a homeless girl living on the streets of Chicago. Despite her circumstances, Isa is stunningly beautiful. Isa complains occasionally about her looks causing problems, and sometimes wishes her appearance wasn't so conspicuous, but she's sufficiently self-aware and grounded to stop short of being obnoxious about it.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheOtori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheOtori">Tales of the Otori</a></em>. Kaede is attractive enough to have men fighting over her, and pretty much everyone who takes an interest in her dies. However, she doesn't spend much time angsting over it, and and spends more time training to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> and educating herself to prove that women are equal to men.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em> features a version of this in <em>Anne's House of Dreams</em>, in which the newly-married Anne's nearest neighbour in a small seaside village is a statuesque blonde "goddess" named Leslie Moore. Who, as it turns out, has a spectacularly tragic backstory, culminating in being trapped in marriage to a man she hated (he had coerced her by threatening to foreclose on a mortgage) leading her to openly despise the beauty she holds responsible—"I wish I was as brown and plain as the brownest and plainest shore girl."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk</a> has problems with this sometimes. She's succubus-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">witch</a>, making her one of the most beautiful and attractive women in the 'verse, so when she converses with her male friends (not boyfriends, just friends), their partners sometimes think she's flirting. What's worse, most of her perceived attractiveness comes from her magic. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jezebel</span> charms her, multiplying the effect, she's attacked twice on the way home by would-be rapists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> Another male version of this is Joseph. He was "a goodly person and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">well favored</a>", and his master's wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">conceived a passion for him</a>. Her repeated advances being refused, she tried to coerce him; when that failed, she went to her husband and accused Joseph of trying to rape her, and Joseph was thrown into prison.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfEsther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfEsther">Book of Esther</a>, the wicked king of Persia is looking for a new wife and forces all the beautiful women in the kingdom to vie for the job in a beauty contest. Esther does as little as possible, eschewing makeup or other attempts to pretty herself up, but "wins" the contest anyway. Traditionally, it's understood that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside">True Beauty Is on the Inside</a>, which actually worked against her.
</li></ul></li><li> In Sherrilyn Kenyon's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHunters">Dark Hunters</a></em> series, there is Acheron; born an Atlantean god but unwittingly raised as a human, he is 'touched by the hand of desire.' This sounds pretty cool... until it turns out that this little gift is meant to punish the only person who genuinely loves him and makes every, single, human being who sees his face desire him so much some will end up killing each other to have him. From the moment he was born. And the only exception is blind people; not even his own family is spared, to the point his human father is so disgusted with himself he blames his young son and starts physically abusing him. Then his uncle sees him...

</li><li> The book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> sort of deals with this. Buttercup laments that everyone puts her on a pedestal, it's such a hassle to maintain such beauty, nobody thinks she's smart, etc. Apparently being the most beautiful woman in the world isn't all peaches and cream. While her beauty does get her promoted to future queen, the Prince threatens to kill her if she refuses. "[E]verybody had told her she was probably the most beautiful woman in the world. Now she was going to the richest and most powerful as well. Don't expect too much from life, Buttercup told herself, be happy with what you have."
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudOfSparrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudOfSparrows">Cloud of Sparrows</a></em>. Emily, the 17-year-old heroine is very beautiful. But because the story is in the 1800's, the world is a sexist, victim-blaming place. She's raped by her stepfather at 13 and escapes to the neighbors, who gossip about how she's tainted now and partially to blame for the sin of being good-looking enough to 'seduce' her step-father. So when the sons overhear this, they think "well, she's fair game for us — it's her fault after all," and of course the neighbors choose to blame her instead of their sons. She internalizes this, and so hates "her accursed beauty" and longs to escape from it. So she goes to Japan, where no one's seen a Western woman before and everyone finds her not just odd-looking but extravagantly hideous — yay! And she spends the whole plot trying desperately to stay in Japan rather than return to a land where she'll be considered beautiful again (and thus, vulnerable to sexual assault).
</li><li> Florimell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene">The Faerie Queene</a></em> doesn't complain but has a right to. After fleeing from three guys who try to rape her, a hyena-like monster, and a witch who clones her, she's kidnapped by Proteus and thrown in his dungeon until she agrees to sleep with him (which she adamantly refuses to the end). The author feels deeply sorry for all the troubles he puts her through... all because she's so beautiful.
</li><li> In Robin Hobb's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Farseer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Farseer">Farseer</a> Trilogy</em>, when Burrich gets around to discussing his backstory, he talks about his grandmother, who was a slave in the Chalced States. Apparently (paraphrased) "Beauty is the worst trait a slave can possess. Her mistresses hated her and her masters raped her."
</li><li> Justified in the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveChildrenAndIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveChildrenAndIt">Five Children and It</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit">E. Nesbit</a>, where the kids get a wish to "be as beautiful as the day" but nobody recognizes them, and they aren't even allowed into their own house. (Fortunately, the wish has a built-in time limit.)
</li><li> A bizarre and creepy version shows up in Salman Rushdie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightsChildren">Midnights Children</a></em>, in which one character is so beautiful that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">physically painful to look at her.</a> The problem is solved by <em>cutting up her face with clamshells</em>

Lucy has the opportunity to read a spell from a Wizard's book that would give her supernatural beauty.

</li><li> Bella, who is annoyed by her many admirers, as she doesn't know how to get rid of them. She is in danger of being gang-raped at one point, but your mileage may vary on whether this is more due to her beauty or more due her looking like an easy victim, or just being female and alone.

Agnes tries to be charitable but "deep down inside, [she] thought a rude word." The book goes on to say that while being a talentless beauty can be a curse, being a talent with no beauty can be a <em>worse</em> curse.

On top of that, she is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">thicker than a yard of lard</a>", and doesn't think she's very attractive at all.

As result, she ends up becoming the mistress of some nine different men in the space of a few years, each of whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">killed her previous liaison</a> in order to claim her.

The princess is imprisoned, brutalized, raped, and impregnated by her father; after she escapes, the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">Convenient Miscarriage</a> nearly kills her. While she never actually remarks on it, she does panic when her nursemaid tells her she looks so much like her mother, who had been called "the most beautiful woman in seven kingdoms". She knows there's something really wrong with her father, even if she doesn't know what it is, and <em>really</em> doesn't want him to have any reason to pay her attention. (It doesn't help that her mother made the king promise not to remarry with any woman less beautiful than her; that makes the princess's resemblance to her mother a little squicky to more people than the princess herself, even if nobody will acknowledge it.)
</li><li> A. S. Byatt's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Possession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Possession">Possession</a></em> features Maud Bailey, who as a professor of feminist literature finds her beauty such a curse that she keeps her head shaved for a while, then ties her hair up in tight braids and a scarf to fend off the accusations of her peers that she grows and dyes it to please men. Arguably, the book is conscious of this trope (she has an ex-lover who used to trapeze around naked and pointedly quote Yeats's "Your Yellow Hair" at her), but plays it very straight.
</li><li> Thomas Raith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> is a good incubus. Naturally, he has the (supernaturally) good looks one would expect an incubus to have, however he feeds on people via sex, and it can easily lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">Death by Sex</a>, which he is unwilling to do due to being a good person and having made the woman he loved almost suffer that fate. He was also for a while unable to hold a job, as his (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">mostly</a>) female colleagues would throw themselves at him. Hell, he couldn't even go for a walk without random joggers throwing themselves all over him.
<ul><li> Another, darker example would be Lily. All she wanted was to settle down, get married and have a family of her own, but because she's a changeling (half human, half Sidhe), she's been tormented and abused by Lloyd Slate, the Winter Knight (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory">like that</a>) purely because of her beauty. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then she was a pawn in the Summer Lady Aurora's mad plan to end the war of Summer and Winter, the end result being that Lily was forcibly made the Summer Lady after Aurora's death. The Summer Queen Titania, mourning the sudden, painful loss of her daughter, was not willing or able to mentor her in her new role, leaving Lily easy prey to the machinations of the Winter Lady Maeve, who was if anything even more mad than Aurora had been. She then gets tricked into an even more convoluted plot that would've both destroyed a huge part of the US and unleashed insanely powerful, nigh-unkillable dark creatures on the world, all while believing that she's the hero of the story. And to top it off, Maeve then unceremoniously kills her off, just to spite her mother Mab, the Winter Queen.</span>

Her family constantly battle to maintain her under protection because, even if she looks like an adult, she has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">mental age of a preschool kid</a>, which causes her to do and say things that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">genuinely innocent</a> but, to the ones who only see her hot body and pretty face, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn">came out as seductive and provocative</a>.

She is initially delighted with her new face, "but the second time a soldier made a pass at me instead of following an order, I knew I definitely had a problem." She does go into the details of why it is actually a problem. It's not the beauty itself; it's because her change in appearance happened after she had already spent decades <em>not</em> being stunningly beautiful. Growing up she had never learned how to handle being treated this way—never learned how to politely let somebody know she is uninterested or learned how her naturally friendly personality could be misinterpreted.

</li><li> In Kristin Cashore's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Graceling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Graceling">Fire</a></em>, the eponymous protagonist is a "monster", which means she is a type of mutant that looks like a mesmerisingly beautiful human. There are monstrous versions of every species in the area in which she lives, and they all crave the flesh of other monsters. Fire is only seventeen and already has a large number of scars where hungry monsters or jealous/lustful humans tried to attack her. Her father was also a monster and gave all other "human" monsters a bad reputation because of the way he misused his ability to attract people and bring them under his spell. Many people despise Fire because of her father's depraved actions, as well as her own monstrous nature<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16pye');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16pye" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16pye');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">'Monstrous' as in species; Fire herself is quite kind.</span>.
<ul><li> To clarify, Fire's beauty is <em>literally</em> mesmerizing. It's actually a power, and she has zero control over it. Unless someone has a <em>very</em> strong mind or knows ahead of time to guard their thoughts, looking at Fire will immediately shut down all rational thought. With the average person, this results in either awestruck staring or attempts to touch her hair or embrace her. They can usually be snapped out of it with a curt reminder. With less stable people, however, the result can be anywhere from passionate declarations of love, a rape attempt, a murderous rage, or all three, and they must be physically restrained to keep them from hurting Fire.
</li><li> Overall, the book is very good at taking the idea of someone being "impossibly beautiful" to the point of being nearly irresistible and showing just how awful that would be. Even leaving aside all of the obvious drawbacks mentioned above, there are smaller, more emotion-based ones that would be just as psychologically hard to deal with. Much of human empathy comes from how people look; the crappier someone looks, the more likely a person is to feel sympathy/empathy for them and reach out with comfort and understanding. Even when beaten, bruised, sickly, and crying, Fire is still the most gorgeous creature in the Dells. How she looks will almost never reflect how she truly feels. Fire herself puts it best:
<div class="indent">"I'm not how I look," [Fire] said suddenly, bursting into tears. "I look beautiful and placid and delightful, but that's not how I feel. I will be sad. I will be sad, and confused, and irritable, very often."
</div></li><li> And to add insult to injury, the other monsters are drawn to her because of her <em>blood</em>. As a woman, guess what happens? Yes, bad enough to have to deal with standard menstruation issues...worse to have to have <em>armed guards</em> protecting you because monsters can and will attack you when they smell that blood.

This causes most of her workmates and superiors to disregard her ideas and underestimate her abilities, and being in vice, she ends up on a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyHarriet">undercover assignments</a>.

She is content in this body, that at least no one would fight over. Indeed, when Ulysses Paxton offers to have her put in a younger and more beautiful body, she rejects it because of the danger that that body would be sold (since they are in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>'s lair and he sells such body transplants).

Kinda a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in that well, she's Sleeping Beauty in modern times.

(For Beauty still is fatal to the Line!)" (In reality, her troubles were mostly due to her husband's political ineptitude.)
</li><li> Very true in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em>, where it is repeatedly implied that the more beautiful a woman is, the better she tastes to monsters.

<ul><li> When a village is taken by Gregor Clegane's men, while many of the women are assaulted, one in particular is especially attractive, and because of this is raped many times per day by The Mountain's men. Eventually, she gets desperate and tries to fend off an attacker with a rock. As punishment, Clegane beheads her.
</li><li> The incredibly beautiful Sansa Stark suffers from this a lot, resulting in a lot of unwanted attention from all the wrong sorts of men. To add up the grossness factor, she's <em>eleven</em> at the start of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> A strange inversion occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series with the veela: They are inhumanly gorgeous, and simply being around one can cause a man to fall in love with her.

</li><li> In Simone de Beauvoir's novel <em>The Mandarins</em>, Josette Belhomme feels misunderstood and has low self-esteem both because men only ever see her beauty, not her human qualities, and because her cruel mother regularly tells her she'll never be good-looking enough. Surprisingly, she's a very endearing character.
</li><li> <em>The Veil of Irazade</em> by Eleanor Farjeon is about an Immortal princess so beautiful that all her suitors murder each other and she is forced to wear a veil "for the safety of the world," that has the added effect of driving off all the new suitors because they're angry that they can't see her.
</li><li> This trope frequently occurs in novels by Iar Elterrus (Иар Эльтеррус). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of the <em>Gray Sword</em> novels has a particularly abhorrent example: raping a free-born in a certain fashion demotes the rape victim to the rapist's slave. Let it suffice to say that in the world's largest city surgeons are paid by girls to scar them or outright perform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">euthanasia</a>, as this is preferable to a slave's life.

Indeed, it's implied at one point that witnessing her having sex is enough to put anyone in a permanent catatonic state of bliss.
</li><li> Heaven help you if you're a beautiful woman in Tess Gerrittsen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RizzoliAndIsles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RizzoliAndIsles">Rizzoli &amp; Isles</a></em> series, because the eponymous former character will <em>instantly</em> hate you and automatically assume that you're a bitch, tramp, idiot, or any of a hundred other negative things, or some combination thereof—all out of jealousy that she herself is plain and average looking. Unfortunately, you'll have no choice but to contend with her, as she's a detective and you've have been or will be the victim of some psycho stalker/rapist/murderer, at which point Rizzoli will actually have a sliver of <em>sympathy</em> for you by musing that it must be difficult to contend with the unwanted attention that can result from looking a certain way. Amusingly, the TV series cast former model/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BaywatchNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BaywatchNights">Baywatch Nights</a></em> star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngieHarmon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngieHarmon">Angie Harmon</a> as Jane.

Skeeve's new moll (aka doxy) plays the role of brainless beauty/aggressive sex kitten to the hilt because it makes her clients leave her alone so she can just live her own life. She only does that because, being beautiful, no one would take her seriously if she tried to actually use her brains, because (paraphrased):
<div class="indent"><strong>Bunny:</strong> That's all men want from a woman. <br/><strong>Skeeve:</strong> Come on, Bunny. That's not fair[...] <br/><strong>Bunny:</strong> You're right: I should have said 'that's all men want from a <em>beautiful</em> woman.

<ul><li> The book centers around a group of fifth-grade girls who bond over their mutual dislike of Taffy Sinclair— a pretty, blonde classmate who hit puberty early and is a bit of a snob— and devote a lot of time trying to one-up her and humiliate her in small ways. It's not until the last quarter of the book, when Taffy's overbearing, somewhat brutish mother finds out that there is a <em>club</em> devoted to <em>bullying her daughter</em> and confronts main character Jana and her mother about it, that the main characters realize that what they've been doing is wrong. Jana's mother points out that Taffy has never actually done anything to any of them— she just happens to be pretty.
</li><li> Over the course of it, there's a subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">realistic</a> version of what the curse of being beautiful really means: when people hate you for being beautiful, they go out of their way to look for your flaws in order to prove you're not <em>perfect</em>, which implies both that you're so close to perfect that people have to actively seek out any imperfections you have, and that even the smallest, single one of those imperfections is evidence that you're a lesser person who has the un-earned benefit of being beautiful. Jana's running irritation with Taffy's one crooked bicuspid continues on-and-off for most of the book, and blinds her to the fact that Taffy <em>doesn't actually have friends</em>. The worst thing she ever does is wear the same dress to school as Jana and look better in it because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">more developed figure</a>. All the "snobby" behavior the Club disdains is really just <em>loneliness</em>, filtered through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">the eyes of girls who go out of their way to hate her.</a>
</li><li> The follow-up series <em>The Fabulous Five</em> plays this straight too. Taffy (while still present), has been replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> Laura McCall, who, like Taffy, is blonde and beautiful.

It couldn't possibly be that Laura possessed genuine acting talent (never mind that Beth has just basically insinuated that the casting director is a pedophile). Laura being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> doesn't help much, but Beth uses her bust size, something she has no control over, as yet another reason to dislike her.

Mrs. Flashman says this in her diary after she's kidnapped by a pirate who'd become smitten with her, lamenting the fact that she's so pretty, especially compared to her less attractive sisters (the rest of the sentence is deleted by the sister who's editing the book).
</li><li> Susan Jagger of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz">Dean Koontz</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FalseMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FalseMemory">False Memory</a></em> is actually an unwitting case of this.

He implants agoraphobia into her subconscious and then slowly destroys her for his own entertainment, all because she is, in his own narration, "exceptionally beautiful". She never figures this out.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SheriSTepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SheriSTepper">Sheri S. Tepper</a>'s <em>Gibbon's Decline and Fall</em>, Sophie, one of the central group of friends, is described as radiantly and effortlessly beautiful.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodEarth">The Good Earth</a></em> — about Chinese farmers — draws a distinction that a beautiful wife is not desirable. The reason is that she was unlikely to be allowed to grow to maturity as a virgin. O-Lan was a slave but was only beaten, as she was too plain for the masters to be attracted to her. She alludes that the prettier slave girls were "carried to a man's bed".
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em>The Snow Queen</em>, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms">Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms</a>, there's Kaari, whose attractiveness actually doesn't come from physical attractiveness. In her people, they read runes at a certain age to tell their talents and abilities. Kaari's first two are simple — Craft and Hearth — but her last one is <em>Heart</em>. This means that everyone likes and wants to either marry her or be friends with her — which is awkward when it involves old married men. She actually considers early on that it is good it is her — if she hadn't been sweet-tempered and good-natured or had been spoiled, she could have very well been a tyrant — the worst kind for no one would rise against one who is <em>loved</em>. Unfortunately, this means the villagers try to stop her and her mother-in-law from saving the one guy, her fiance Veikko, who cares for her <em>because</em> she is herself, and not because of the Heart rune.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindupGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindupGirl">The Windup Girl</a></em> plays this from an unusual angle. One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Emiko's</a> most notable physical features is her smooth, flawless, and beautiful skin. The problem? This was accomplished by genetically tweaking her DNA to make her pores much smaller than normal humans' — too small to be functional, in fact. As a result, she can't properly regulate her body temperature and has to regularly apply ice to her skin to keep herself from dangerously overheating in the sweltering climate of 23rd-century Thailand.

</li><li> According to Ayesha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/She" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/She">She</a></em>, her beauty drives men mad. It doesn't seem to bother her that much, in fact she rather enjoys blasting them when they get on her nerves. She is frankly not a nice person.

They want to follow her, but Marcela was in a remote point to prevent them from following her... because she has been trying to be free all her life and this is only another day for her. The scene ends with Don Quixote forbidding anyone to follow Marcela, claiming that she is a decent person who deserves her freedom.

She's tall, slim, has "Playboy-furniture" legs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress">huge breasts</a>.

Since she was eleven years old, the men around her have imploded simply from being in her presence.

But from even an early age she was, due to her gender and overall attractiveness, treated as less than a person. Case in point, in spite of making perfect grades in high school, and setting records in track and field and weight lifting, the guidance counselor recommended she take an "easier" school. She broke his nose, and then went on to make the Dean's list at MIT with a 4.0.

Originally, they were made to be sexual playthings for the very wealthy. Most die young, the victims of violence from someone who wants to have them or own them. Very few manage to escape being involved in the sex trade in some way; and most of those who do so manage it by acquiring a very powerful "protector".

It isn't an unalloyed good because, in his past, it led the pimp Lorenzo to imprison him in a brothel catering to sadists. Years later, he's almost gang-raped in a foreign city, but saved by the intervention of a kindly prostitute. Lorenzo also purchased Vincent Demabrien for his brothel, presumably because, of the Demabrien brothers, he was "the youngest and most beautiful of the three". Shannon also suffers from a helping of this trope: because he so closely resembles his gorgeous but villainous blond mother, who earned the nickname "Golden Bitch," people refer to him as the "Golden Whelp" and suspect him (wrongly) of similarly treasonous behavior.

Kasia is resigned and prepared for it but naturally has some buried resentment. And then everyone is shocked when the Dragon takes her best friend, Agnieszka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen">The Pigpen</a>, instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SafeHaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SafeHaven">Safe Haven</a></em> When the heroine flees from her abusive husband, he's able to track her down in Philadelphia because basically everyone she interacted with along the way—the ticket agent, the bus driver, the hotel manager, her employer—remembers her because was so pretty. He himself almost lampshades this with his thoughts on the matter: "She made a mistake at the bus station, though she really couldn't help it. She should have bought her ticket from a woman, because men always remember a pretty girl." She's more successful in escaping from him a second time because this time she buys her ticket from a woman. Sure enough, when he questions them, no one remembers her.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfTheTearling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfTheTearling">Queen of the Tearling</a></em>, Marguerite (who has recently been freed from the fate of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">rape slave</a>) explains to Kelsea that beauty can be a curse. Kelsea, who is plain and very jealous of Marguerite, does not get it, despite having witnessed the woman's fate ... and being the Queen herself, and as such in a much better position than a random beautiful woman. Even more ironic because Kelsea, when she was worried that a man might have raped her while she slept, was told by him that she's too plain for his tastes.
</li><li> The Colleen McCullough novel <em>Bittersweet</em> is the story of four sisters, two sets of identical twins, attending nursing school in 1920s Australia. While they are all attractive, it is unanimous that youngest sister Kitty is the prettiest, something that their mother has <em>obsessed</em> over since they were children, to the point where Kitty actually tried to mutilate herself on one occasion and attempt suicide on another, feeling that her mother did not care about anything but her good looks. Of the four, she struggles the hardest to be taken seriously in her studies, constantly fends off numerous unwanted advances, and the man she eventually marries has to spend <em>years</em> trying to convince her that he loves her for reasons other than her beauty, and even then she's never 100% sure that she isn't more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife">Trophy Wife</a>.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoreLay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoreLay">Lore Lay</a>" by Clemens Brentano, Lore Lay is very unhappy about all the men that fall in love with her, as she loves none of them. She even says to see her own reflection is so painful to her, she wants to die. Her beauty also leads to her being accused of witchcraft.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology">Dreamblood Duology</a></em>, Tiaanet is lusted after by pretty much every man who sets eyes on her, including her own father.
</li><li> In the Sherry Thomas romance, <em>Beguiling the Beauty</em>, Venetia Easterbrook is described beautiful enough to incite riots. Nearly every man she meets falls desperately in love with her at first glance, and when she was a child, her younger brother could not invite friends over for fear they'd become smitten with her. This causes Venetia many problems. Her first husband marries her for her looks, only to become trapped in a downward spiral of alcoholism and self-loathing when Venetia, whom he initially viewed as nothing more than "a pretty accessory", garners more attention and regard than he does. After realizing that every man he meets will lust after his wife, he blames her and becomes verbally abusive as well. Her beauty also makes her the target of vicious rumors, and when she meets her love interest Christian de Monfort, he initially wants nothing to do with her because of her reputation. Although Venetia often laments her beauty, she is a sympathetic character because although she possesses many virtues—such as wit, intelligence, determination and charm—most people see her only as beautiful and make assumptions about who she is based solely on her physical attributes. Somewhat subverted in that Venetia recognizes the advantage her beauty gives her, to point of developing an alter ego she refers to as "The Great Beauty"—a stereotypical version of herself who employs the haughtiness and snobbery that others have wrongfully assumed are a real part of her nature—which she lapses into whenever she needs to manipulate someone into doing her will. That she does this only as a last resort keeps her from being an unsympathetic character.
<div class="indent"><strong>Christian:</strong> I disapprove of your character, Mrs. Easterbrook. <br/><strong>Venetia:</strong> You do not know my character. You only know my face.
</div></li><li> In the Chinese classic <em>Biographies of Exemplary Women</em>, a magistrate says that he disproportionately punished a petty criminal on the basis that- if he had punished her fairly- people would say he'd been seduced by her beauty. Is it rational? No, but rumors rarely are. (The heroine believes him, but says that it wasn't a good enough reason to pervert justice.)
</li><li> In Raithby's <em>Winter Wolf</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">appropriately-surnamed</a> Katalina Winter considers this trope:
<div class="indent"><em>...shed always wondered whether shed been left on Mr. and Mrs. Winters doorstep as some kind of joke: her eyes, of blue-silver, looked as if they were carved of ice themselves. Katalina had hair that was so light blond it was white in the sunlight, and pale skin to match. She was the embodiment of winter. <br/>Shed been the butt of many jokes, but after a while, shed come to embrace her unique looks.</em>
</div></li><li> In <em>Trickster's Choice</em>, the aristocrat Aly never stops being proud of her looks, but quickly decides they'll attract unwanted attention when she's kidnapped and sold as a slave, so she deliberately disfigures herself while in the pens. An onlooker recognizes why she's doing it, but remarks that some people would prefer concubinage to the backbreaking lives of labor slaves.
</li><li> In <em>Wolfsangel</em>, a slave mutilates her face so that her owner will stop raping her. It doesn't work- her pretty face was a bonus, obviously, but it wasn't the exact...body part...he was interested in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maia">Maia</a></em>, the semi-pornographic sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shardik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shardik">Shardik</a></em>, the protagonist grows up in a small cabin and ends up so beautiful that she is seduced by her stepfather, causing her jealous mother to sell her to a passing slave-trader.
</li><li> In Justina Ireland's <em>Dread Nation</em>, a steampunk alternate history zombie thriller, the main characters are black girls are training to be Attendants, bodyguards who protect rich women. One of them, Katherine, is <em>so</em> gorgeous it ruins her chances of ever being hired, because her potential clients all see her as competition instead. This gets her shipped off to a horrible town run by a racist, tyrannical Sheriff—her friend's quick thinking allows her to pass as white, which allows her to escape being basically enslaved, but lands her as almost every man in town's new crush. This is not a good thing when she knows what they'd do to her if they found out she was actually biracial.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippyDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkippyDies">Skippy Dies</a></em>: Lori is popular at school because of her looks, but this brings her mainly fake friends who betray her at the first chance, and lust from psycho creeps like Carl. After Skippy dies and she receives media attention for the fact that Skippy scrawled her name in his dying breaths, it becomes clear that the public and especially her parents are interested only in her beauty and don't care about her inner self. Lori starts starving herself to dangerous degrees in part to make herself less beautiful and make all the attention go away.

Her best friend Besma attempts to buy her freedom because she knows Petra is too pretty, and horrible things would happen to her if she falls in the wrong hands. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happens and she is sold to a brothel where she is abused <em>even more</em> by the clientele.
</li><li> A minor character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> is a copper who is so good-looking, nobody can believe he's a policeman. This is great for undercover work, less so when you're trying to exercise your authority.

Although it's shown that it's just not her beauty but the fact that the men are on pervy power trips when abusing her. The fact that her real personality is strong-willed and not likely to have sex with any rich pervy men on power trips probably has something to do with it.

Even Tyrion had a desire to sleep with her, but he refused to force himself upon her. Sandor claims to Arya that he should have "fucked her bloody" when he had the chance during The Battle of Blackwater, but it's unclear how much he meant it (considering his obvious soft spot for Sansa) and how much he was merely saying it to goad Arya into killing him.

To elaborate, Dr. House told him that most women don't notice anything about Chase other than his looks, and Chase didn't believe him. So, as a test, House removed every other attribute he has — he isn't allowed to use his rather adorable Australian accent, his nice job as a doctor can't be mentioned, and he has to act like a complete aimless, jobless moron — and bets that even with this, he'll still get more than 12 out of 20 numbers. He does, losing $100 to House as a result.
</li><li> An interesting example occurs in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> where an <em>ugly</em> character is the one making out beauty to be a curse. Height says that because when he and his wife met, they were both fairly ugly, they knew their feelings for each other were real, and not based on superficial aspects. Incidentally, he's talking to his daughter-in-law, a beautiful pop singer who has just learned her husband had an affair because he had difficulty reconciling the gorgeous sex-symbol of her public persona (which he was initially attracted to) and the dowdier aspects of her everyday personality, thus giving her a somewhat roundabout experience of this trope.

<ul><li> On the police side of the show, their is a male example in Detective Rey Curtis. He is constantly hit on by women while doing his job, with some of them not taking no for an answer at first, which he finds annoying as he wants to be a good and faithful husband to his wife, and taken seriously as a law enforment officer. There are even cases where the prosecution are at risk of losing, because the defense accuses Rey of sleeping with a female suspect or key witness during trial and tainting them, because they assume he would. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unforutnately, he does eventually give in and cheats on his wife with a woman he met at a park one day.

Another skit in the episode takes this to creepier levels. Stone's character is walking through a metal detector and is forced to strip to her underwear by the TSA agents and the pilots who insist that the detector keeps going off and that she needs to remove her clothes to ensure that she's not carrying a weapon.

</li><li> In another episode where George is hiring a new secretary, Jerry naturally assumes he's going to hire a beautiful woman, but George tells him that his intention is just the opposite—he <em>doesn't</em> want to do that, knowing that it will distract him from his work. He is promptly seen telling several gorgeous applicants, "you're obviously very qualified, but looking at you, I can't even remember my own name and if I hire you, it's only a matter a time before you file a complaint for sexual harassment." Never mind that they can actually sue him for discrimination as he's outright telling them that he not hiring them because of how they look.

In one episode, Carrie brings home a male model who complains that women always want him for sex and he can never be taken seriously.

</li><li> The knight Diarmuid of the Love Spot, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark">Beauty Mark</a> made all women who gaze upon him fall madly in love.

</li><li> Cú Chulainn, whose beauty threatened the men of Ulster enough that they unanimously decided he needed to be married off before he charmed all of their wives and daughters into bed (which he did anyways, because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Cu Chulainn</a>).

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> Helen of Sparta (later of Troy), from Greek Mythology, was "the face that launched a thousand ships" and kicked off the ten-year Trojan War between her lover Paris and her husband Menelaus. A war in which she did not have fun. If you read the myths that lead up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>, Helen was living a moderately quiet and happy life before her status as "the most beautiful" got her tapped to be the bribe in a contest between three vain goddesses. She also got kidnapped when she was <em>eight</em> because her beauty was already evident, and nearly caused a war between her suitors. It took Odysseus's wisdom to prevent it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Poor, poor Helen</a>.
</li><li> Psyche was so beautiful that first, everyone was worshiping her as a goddess, but no one was willing to marry her and then, second, Aphrodite — the <em>goddess of beauty</em> — got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealous</a>, and sent her son Eros to make her fall in love with something loathsome. Psyche was so beautiful that Eros, the god of love, fell in love with her himself and refused to carry out Aphrodite's instructions, instead taking her to live in luxury with him. Psyche ruins paradise by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">ignoring Eros's warning not to look at him at night</a> and accidentally burning him with lamp oil, but, after a decent amount of suffering, Eros <em>still</em> loves her and convinces Zeus to elevate Psyche to immortality.
</li><li> Princess Andromeda had a similar story to Psyche, with a little help from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a>, Cassiopeia, who bragged incessantly about her daughter's beauty. That got the poor girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARock">Chained to a Rock</a> and about to be eaten by a monster until her soon-to-be husband Perseus stopped by after killing Medusa and pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>.
</li><li> Narcissus, this trope's most famous victim. He was so beautiful that pretty much every woman and man who looked upon him fell in love with him. He knew about this, and was a jerk about it, to the point of urging at least one suitor to commit suicide. The gods, wishing to punish him, arranged things so that he would fall in love with his own reflection in a lake, resulting in him wasting away because he didn't want to tear his gaze away from the sight.
</li><li> Hyacinthos was another famous victim from Greek mythology. He was so beautiful that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">two gods fell in love with him</a>, Apollo and Zephyrus. Zephyrus ended up killing him in a jealous rage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">Medusa</a>, who in one version of her myth was turned into a monster by Athena because Poseidon "was overcome by her beauty" and raped her in Athena's temple. (In the original she <em>always</em> was a monster.)
</li><li> Adonis was so stunningly beautiful that he charmed <em>two</em> goddesses (Aphrodite and Persephone) when he was a <em>baby</em>. While the two goddesses initially agreed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory">joint custody</a>, the moment Adonis awoke to hormones Aphrodite used her powers to make him fall in love with her. The jealous Persephone told Aphrodite's on-and-off lover Ares about her new beau, and he killed Adonis in a jealous rage.
</li><li> Ganymede, a Trojan prince, was so beautiful that Zeus fell in love with him, decided to kidnap him and took him to live with him in Olympus as cupbearer for all eternity, gaining himself the anger of Hera in the process. So much so that Zeus had to turn Ganymede into the constellation Aquarius ("Water-bearer").
</li><li> Some myths from the Orphic tradition say that Persephone was courted vigorously by many gods besides Hades because of her beauty. Demeter had to hide her in a cave in Sicily to help her escape her suitors and even then she was seduced by Zeus in the form of a serpent. The whole thing ended with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">famous abduction</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sita in the epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana">Ramayana</a></em> is kidnapped by Demon King, Ravana because of her legendary beauty. Although, part of Ravanas motivation was revenge for Sitas husband Rama cutting off his sister Shurpanakas nose in self-defense.
</li><li> Draupadi is a legendary beauty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata">The Mahabharata</a></em> and suffers at least two attempts at kidnapping/assault from Kichaka and Jayadratha because of it. She is also humiliated and stripped in the open court.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AraTheHandsome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AraTheHandsome">Ara the Handsome</a> was an Armenian hero considered so fair that the Assyrian queen Semiramis waged a war on Armenia just to capture him and have him for herself. He ends up dying because of this.

St. Helens</a> is often the heroine (or at least one of the heroines) among the Puyallup, Cowlitz, Klickitat, and Yakima nations: according to the Puyallup, elderly Loowitlakla, or Loowit, was rewarded with eternal youth by the Chief of the Gods since she had preserved fire in her lodge for two nations, but the chieftains of each tribe, who were brothers and handsome young men but notoriously hotheaded, began warring because the fair maiden who kept the communal fire could not choose between them, a war that burned and buried whole villages and forests.

One glamour model revealed that she and another woman were called to the front on their first day by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a> who then said: "sluts like you all sleep your way to the top". Kristal Marshall also said in an interview that she felt the trainers resented the fact that she <em>wanted</em> to learn to wrestle and "I don't think they wanted me to get good".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson">Torrie Wilson</a> suffered greatly throughout her career because of her beauty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Nidia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Nidia">Nidia</a> was jealous that Torrie was chosen to pose for <em>Playboy</em> over her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DawnMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DawnMarie">Dawn Marie</a> ended up making unwanted advances because she was attracted to her, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a> was a bit of both. Likewise, Kenzo Suzuki fell for her, leading to his wife Hiroko to get jealous and attack Torrie for it.
</li><li> In general female wrestlers who come from beauty backgrounds — modelling, dancing, gymnastics, etc. — often have to face an uphill battle from fans. Usually the prettier the female is (and if she has a modelling background), she'll quite easily be dismissed as just eye candy. For years it was also assumed that model-turned-wrestlers either didn't care about the business or were using it as a stepping stone for other forms of entertainment such as acting (Not helping that some, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a> have outright admitted as such). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis">Maria Kanellis</a> once unloaded with a speech defying this attitude.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2p8f8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2p8f8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2p8f8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"That is so horrible...You want to know my honest opinion on it?

The only reason a lot of us have left is because we didn't get the opportunities there we wanted or thought we'd earned, or the opportunities we fought for, that's the only reason! All that "you're just a diva"; it sounds so trashy. If you are on the road 250...350...days a year there is no way [it's just for fame]you obviously want to be there. Sure you get on television, but every weekend [on house shows], you're getting your ass kicked, you're all covered in bruises, I look at Candice Michelle, she was a Go Daddy girl she got there. But she worked hard. I used to look at her legs; from the top to the bottom they were covered in huge bruises from all the different places Beth had grabbed her to put her in position...She worked her tail off to become champion! For you to say that you have no clue how passionate these women are! I would still be there if I got the opportunities I wanted. We're not actresses on television playing an action star who doesn't really get hit; we were getting hit. I'm no longer there because I spoke up and because I got spoke up that's why I'm sitting here."</span> Lest you think this is just restricted to WWE's women, Marti Belle who trained on the indies (thus fulfilling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayingTheirDues">Paying Their Dues</a> that is the main attack of the model-turned-wrestlers) says she faced the same attitudes when she was breaking into the business because of her modelling background.
</li><li> Krissy Vaine alluded to this when describing her battle with depression while in the WWE developmental system. She and the other Divas became paranoid about preserving their looks — "it's either be a perfect 10 or bye bye Diva wannabe" — even spending half their monthly pay on cosmetic surgery. Krissy also noted that when DSW was integrated into OVW, the only reason she wasn't fired along with so many other girls is that she had a modelling background.

She had actually trained on the indies as Kyra, but many people overlooked her wrestling experience and thought of her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> valet. Due to some of the Fanservice she provided — dropping into the splits on the apron to give the crowd a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">Panty Shot</a> — there was a storm of controversy when she won the Women's Championship. Like many others, she shook this off through consistently good ring work. The cover of the October 2007 issue of <em>The Wrestler</em> asked, "MELINA: Too Beautiful To Be Taken Seriously?"

Serious wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore">Jazz</a> hated her because they thought she was getting by on her looks. The prudish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a> hated her sex appeal taking too much attention away from the wrestling. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Victoria</a> just hated her in a crazy jealous way.

<ul><li> Played hilariously straight by the Nymph, a fey woman who is so beautiful that looking at one can blind or kill (in 3.5 Edition, the killing effect was replaced with a voluntary ability to stun people). She can, however, turn it on and off. (In Second Edition, whether the nymph killed or blinded was based on whether she was naked or clothed, respectively, and couldn't be turned off voluntarily.) The above being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">based on</a> actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek Mythology</a>.
</li><li> Played more seriously with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGorgon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGorgon">Medusas</a> in 5th Edition.

Once the deal was up, they were cursed to become Medusas, but they retained their beauty and vanity, so if a Medusa ever catches sight of her reflection she'll helplessly stare at it until she succumbs to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">gaze attack</a>.

However, the highest levels of good looks can give you a reaction <em>penalty</em> if the other character already has good reason to dislike you.
<ul><li> If you try to use magic to improve your appearance above the highest possible level you gain the Terror ability because "too much is too much".
</li><li> The point cost difference between the second-highest and very-highest level of good looks is fairly small. The rules justify this by noting that the very highest level exacerbates the negative side effects of good looks (in addition to the jealousy problem noted above, there are issues like being noticed and remembered when you're trying to keep a low profile or attracting unwanted attention from would-be suitors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalkers</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">slavers</a>).

For example, it's explicitly stated that concubines chosen by the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears... don't survive the night. And as the Manual of Exalted Power: Infernals puts it:

When he shows up, everything — and we mean <em>everything</em> — loses itself in rapture at his presence. In one town he visited, the humans went insane or died, the grass turned to crystal, and the birds fell out of the sky, singing until their hearts gave out. Even <em>pictures</em> of him cause physical/psychological damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant">Aberrant</a></em>, novas (superhumans) with Mega-Appearance can have this due to Taint effects. Taint is more likely to produce deformities, but possible effects also include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">inhuman beauty that frightens rather than attracts</a>, irresistible desire, or an inability to be taken seriously (known as the "bimbo-nova" effect).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em> has "Curse of Venus" as one of the Flaws that a character can take. Characters who have this Flaw are very attractive to people the character does not <em>want</em> to attract, who get crushes on him or her and will not be dissuaded. The character also tends to fall in love with inappropriate people in inappropriate circumstances, and the people the character <em>is</em> interested in tending to think that the character is vain and shallow.
</li><li> In the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> RPG, attractiveness is a characteristic you have to buy for your character. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNondescript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNondescript">average looking</a> is actually far more expensive than being stunningly attractive because good looks make you more recognizable (generally a bad thing for a spy). On the other hand, average looks are also far more expensive than being remarkably ugly. This encourages players to re-create the James Bond atmosphere, where most main characters are either stunningly attractive or hideously deformed while requiring them to pay a price if they want to have looks that help them blend in with the crowd.
</li><li> A similar concept is discussed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> sourcebook <em>Lawyers, Guns and Money</em>. One character is noted as being attractive though not amazingly beautiful, the ideal point for a con-woman. After all, being attractive sends a little false hope to the mark, a very subtle encouragement. Being amazingly beautiful, however, would instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchlubPubSeductionDeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSchlubPubSeductionDeduction">raise questions</a>: Why me? What do I have for this girl? As a con-woman, you never want your mark asking questions.

<ul><li> Whereas aasimars have traditionally been portrayed as pretty much universally loved since they first appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>, <em>Pathfinder</em>'s <em>Blood of Angels</em> sourcebook describes them as having this trait to the extent they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>. In essence, aasimars are seen as being so beautiful, special and talented that they are invariably accosted by superstitious people begging for lucky charms (such as locks of their hair), or for healing touches or similar, and who often get upset with the aasimar when they refuse, even if told that such trinkets and actions won't work. Many aasimars who fall to evil do so due to this making them feel all others are selfish, shallow, petty creatures. On top of everything else, the aasimars' beauty and their disconnect from their communities make them common victims of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanTrafficking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperhumanTrafficking">slave trade</a>.
</li><li> From <em>Pathfinder</em> also comes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">changelings</a>, the daughters of humanoids and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">hags</a> who are described as always being beautiful, but in such a fashion that the effect is eerily... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">off</a></em> and so people find them unnerving more than they do attractive.
</li><li> Nymphs are some of the beautiful creatures in existence in the material world, to an extent that their magic likely plays a role in making them the visions of beauty that they are. Anyone looking at a nymph is gripped by a supernatural obsession with the fey that will drive them to seek closeness with her by any means possible — and nymphs cannot control this. The result is that most nymphs need to live in hiding to know anything like peace, and while they're more than capable of fending off nosy mortals and lesser fey, things become rather more dangerous when someone like a powerful wizard or a demon becomes obsessed with a nymph.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Sword and Sorcery game <em>Blade of the Iron Throne</em>, the Legendary Beauty asset can be taken as either a Good asset or a Poor asset. While the Good version of the asset gives you bonuses for interactions with those compatible to you and penalties for interactions with those not compatible to you, the Poor version of the asset falls right into this trope, with the character in question receiving more than their fair share of unwanted attention from powerful but obnoxious suitors, leches, slavers and the like.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd">Sweeney Todd</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original Christopher Bond version, Sweeney believes this about his wife, and with good reason — it's the reason he was falsely transported for life.
<div class="indent"><strong>Anthony:</strong> What was your crime? <br/><strong>Sweeney:</strong> My wife was beautiful.

Sweeney's wife was so beautiful that she attracted Judge Turpin, which kick starts the plot. Then her daughter Johanna is equally as beautiful and also attracts the Judge (despite him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">being her adoptive father</a>). Sweeney himself is also cursed since he attracts Mrs. Lovett, which leads to several of the tragic circumstances throughout the story. So really the entire plot is because a whole family is So Beautiful, It's A Curse.

</li><li> Referenced in the (aptly named) play <em>Reasons To Be Pretty</em>, where one of the characters comments on the problems her beauty has caused her, and hopes that her unborn daughter won't be <em>too</em> attractive so that she can be spared that.
<div class="indent"><strong>Carly:</strong> I really hope she's no more than pretty. That she's not some beauty queen that people cant stop staring at because I'd hate that for her, to be this object, some <em>thing</em> that people can't help gawking at. Because if she is, if she ends up with a face that is some sort of magnet for men, the way I've been, I'd almost rather it was a situation where she was oblivious to it  not blind or anything, I wouldnt wish that on her, but close. Some sort of oblivion that gets pasted over her eyes so she can go about life and not be aware that people are cruel in many ways, not just with their words but with the ways they look at you and desire you and, and, and almost hate you because of it.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Six" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Six">Six</a></em>, this is ultimately the fate of Catherine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife. At first she's rather arrogant about her beauty and claims that she's the best-looking of the monarch's many lovers ("I think we can all agree / I'm a ten amongst these threes"). But then she starts going into her past—"And ever since I was a child / I'd make the boys go wild"—and explains that throughout her entire life, men have treated her like a sex object (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, for example, Catherine was only thirteen when her music teacher, Henry Mannix, began having sex with her—and he was <em>thirty-two</em>). Though initially Catherine claims that she likes all of the attention and power she derives from these relationships, she ultimately realizes that she's been a victim of statuatory rape and abuse for her entire life, and the one time she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">thought she'd finally made a male friend</a>, it turns out he was in love with her too; to rub salt into the wound, it was her friendship with that man which ended up getting her killed, as she was accused of adultery.

</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short called "Broom-Stick Bunny", Witch Hazel explains to the audience that she's "deathly afraid" of getting prettier as she gets older, and it's fully justified at the end of the short: After she gets turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">gorgeous redhead</a> after mistakenly drinking a beauty elixir disguised as tea, she meekly asks the genie in her magic mirror if she's still ugly. When the Genie sees Hazel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch">new look</a>, he starts chasing after her on his magic carpet, which of course horrifies her.

He just wanted people to appreciate him for his combs, not his beauty so he would put a sack over his head to hide his face. Since the rest of his family has the sacks too, it's possible his wife is the same way and his children.
</li><li> Fluttershy, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipisMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipisMagic">My Little Pony Friendshipis Magic</a></em> episode "Green Isn't Your Color", becomes a model to help draw attention to Rarity's new dress line. To her displeasure, doing so leads her to develop a huge following where she can't even walk down the street without getting mobbed by scores of admirers and paparazzi. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a>, this is indeed a curse.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>; Princess Penelope explained her love for Krusty because she felt he was the only friend she had when she was 12 since she wasn't popular for being more pretty and friendly than the other girls who in return shunned her.
</li><li> In episode 43 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> Knuckles says, "I can't help being attractive! It's a blessing and a curse!" after he's accused of playing a part in burning down Tails' workshop because of a flirtatious female character. It turns out that the female's attention was all in Knuckles' imagination.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, getting a door slammed in his face made Squidward So Handsome Its A Curse. He likes it at first but soon tires of having all of Bikini Bottom following him around <em>everywhere</em>. Mr. Krabs tries to take advantage of this by charging people to see Squidward, all the while he's trying to get SpongeBob to slam the door in his face again to get things back to normal. Somehow it turns him even <em>more</em> ridiculously handsome and muscled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Somehow he gets back to normal</a>.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Abe Lincoln</a> explains to him that good looking people tend to have things handed to them in life and once they get to the age where their looks start to fade, they're left with nothing. Less attractive people, on the other hand, work hard to make something of themselves and in the long run, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">they have far more character</a>. Kyle takes this lesson to heart when he learns the list was a fake but chooses <em>not</em> to find out if he was voted one of the attractive kids.
</li><li> Bebe was the first girl to develop breasts (she's nine; they were comically tiny), which made all the boys inexplicably drawn to her until they devolve into acting like cavemen. They finally snap out of it when she comes to school wearing a cardboard box to completely hide her figure.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There is a sad degree of truth to this in real life, and if you whine about how pretty you are, no one is going to pity you.
<ul><li> How can you be sure if people like you because you're <em>you</em> or because you're pretty? It may be hard to make friends too, due to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">pretty people = bitches/jerks</a>" preconceptions.
</li><li> Especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, successful career women who happened to be even mildly attractive were often dismissed as having '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop">slept their way to the top</a>' because, being women, of course they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">couldn't possibly have gained their position</a> through actual <em>merit</em>! It is a trend that continues into the 21st century, albeit less overtly.
</li><li> The heightened possibility of being stalked, harassed or even raped makes it worse. An article on a poverty-stricken area of Vietnam demonstrated this — it's the prettiest children who are given cell phones to call for help, as they are the most likely to be targeted by sex traffickers. And throughout history, attractive girls were made into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slaves</a> and sold off to the highest bidders.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tann">Georgia Tann<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "The Baby Thief", used a similar tactic for the two decades that she ran an illegal adoption ring—driving through poor neighborhoods, abducting the prettiest children, and selling them to unsuspecting wealthy couples.
</li></ul></li><li> Beautiful sex workers (i.e lap dancers, strippers or prostitutes) will sometimes get unnerving and depraved clients who won't respect their personal space or can be aggressively impatient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">which can lead to horrific results.</a>
</li><li> Another example of this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">becoming beautiful with age</a>. Men and women who have been bullied or mocked while growing up may not recognize their own beauty. They may have become so used to being alone or mocked that they don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessChickMagnet">recognise</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantBelieveAGuyLikeYouWouldNoticeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantBelieveAGuyLikeYouWouldNoticeMe">understand</a> when they are being flirted with, the sudden amount of attention can confuse them or make them paranoid. Other times they may not understand how to respond to compliments or how to respond to flirting. They could have also been lead to believe that their flaws are their only defining trait due to their history as a bully victim. In addition, some bullies will pick on their victims by pretending to be interested in them in order to humiliate them, which can cause victims to reject genuine interest under the erroneous belief that it's just another trick.
</li><li> Another form of curse is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractivenessIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractivenessIsolation">loneliness as beauty can make people unapproachable</a>. Men and women can leave admirers tongue-tied or make them believe that the beautiful person is out of their league, they can also be hated and/or envied by others for their looks. In worst-case scenarios, it may become hard to find true friends during difficult times because suitors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend">might pose as a supportive friend</a> to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency">closer to them</a>.
</li><li> Being on the Autism spectrum while also being conventionally attractive can be challenging. Autistic people don't have the best understanding of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHowToSayThanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHowToSayThanks">how to respond to compliments</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonverbalMiscommunication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonverbalMiscommunication">how to read facial expressions</a>, which can cause some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">cruel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">misunderstandings</a>. Either from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">autistic person</a> or from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">embarrassed admirer.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion">Beauty Inversion</a> trope exists primarily for this reason. Take an actress who can't get roles that showcase anything besides her beauty — and have her play an ugly character. It's almost guaranteed to win critical acclaim.
</li><li> Boys who fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> archetypes in schools with a traditional atmosphere tend to be alienated by their classmates. The other male classmates would consider them as "too gay" to be friends with, and female classmates would potentially find them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">too pretty</a>, much like the female examples here.
</li><li> There's a Spanish refrain that says "The luck of the ugly woman is wished by the pretty woman"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4aolz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4aolz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4aolz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"La suerte de la fea, la guapa la desea."</span> which is based upon this trope. There's a similar phrase in Turkish<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5mp25');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5mp25" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5mp25');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>"Allah çirkin şansı versin"</em></span> which means "May God give [everyone] an ugly one's luck". It's also said that "beauties are often unlucky".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6cmfz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6cmfz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6cmfz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>"Güzeller bahtsız olur."</em></span>
</li><li> Many beautiful women prefer plain-looking or not-so-good-looking women as their intimate friends as they are more likely to like them as who they are as human beings and what their personality is rather than their looks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow">Jean Harlow</a> quickly got a reputation as a "floozy" during her early days, entirely down to her beauty and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Shameless Fanservice Girl</a> nature. She even nearly got rejected by MGM because Louis B Mayer was repulsed by her sexuality. Studios constantly tried to campaign with photos of her doing charity work in order to make her seem like an All-American Girl. Like Marilyn Monroe below, she got typecast as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a>.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>'s bio, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecast">typecast</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> (though she did make a career out of it), and her final years of life were marked by illness, personal problems and a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to work with. She eventually married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMiller">Arthur Miller</a> of all people in an attempt to be taken seriously as an intelligent, substantive person. This also struck her in her youth: First, her guardian's husband tried to molest her, and then her cousin (once removed) — and there were probably others. All of this happened before she turned 16.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a>, who wrote: "My face has been my misfortune" in her autobiography, describing it as a mask she couldn't remove. Case in point: Lamarr was an absolute genius. She helped to develop the technology that would later become cell phones and wi-fi. She wanted to continue to pursue it as part of the war effort, but it was decided she could be better put to use to boost morale and sell war bonds. Her looks were valued over a mind that laid the groundwork for modern technology (there was probably some run-of-the-mill sexism that had nothing to do with her looks, but that is still part of the trope.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaureenOHara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaureenOHara">Maureen O'Hara</a> — who, while still learning her craft as a girl and teenager in Ireland, had won every major theatrical award that country had to offer — relates in her autobiography how her exceptional beauty often prevented her from getting serious dramatic roles. She was often cast as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> in films that mainly showcased her beauty, as opposed to her dramatic talents. This was a shock after growing up an awkward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl">Huge Schoolgirl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty">who didn't consider herself beautiful until she saw herself on the big screen</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a> said that she almost didn't get the role that put her on the map (a homeless crack addict in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JungleFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JungleFever">Jungle Fever</a></em>) because when she showed up to audition, the casting director took one look at her and said that no one would find someone as beautiful as her believable in such a part. Even after she got the part, she still had to resort to <em>not showering</em> for several days to achieve the right look. She said the same thing around the time she made <em>Monster's Ball.</em> The executives said, "She's too Cover Girl." She won an Oscar for it. She also had to fight for the part, informing the director that a woman still had problems even if she was attractive.
</li><li> One reviewer said of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKruger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKruger">Diane Kruger</a>, "she's too pretty to play a role of any real substance." Most of her roles have been based around her beauty — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy">Troy</a></em> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole">Star-Making Role</a> was, in fact, her playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman">World's Most Beautiful Woman</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>: despite the fact that he really did work his way up with diverse and difficult roles in independent film, once Pop Culture got a hold of him there was no stopping them, and it's taken him years to earn back his reputation as a legitimately great actor.
</li><li> Bjorn Andresen <a class="urllink" href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/bjorn%20andresen/Astatie/Bjorn%20Andresen/0003.jpg">got a hefty dose of this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> when he played the role of the youthful Tadzio in the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathInVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathInVenice">Death in Venice</a></em>, where the whole PLOT revolved around an older man who became obsessed with the youthful beauty of the character in question. He also experienced an unfortunate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> when the director of the film took him to gay bars when he was 16, and he was continually leered over, making him feel like a piece of meat. The fact that the film required him to give men lustful, come-hither looks did not help things for him at all. As a consequence, Andresen decided he'd never do another role with any emphasis on his looks, or any kind of homosexual character ever again.
</li><li> In ancient Sparta, a citizen could murder a Helot — the working class who outnumbered their militaristic overlords many times over — for any reason. Killing a Helot was, in fact, an acceptable shortcut through the final exam in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">military training</a>. Many Helots were cut down for being <em>too attractive</em>.
</li><li> In Ancient Rome, excessive handsomeness, and in particular a man who went out of his way to look fashionable, was considered the mark of either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a> or an effeminate homosexual.
</li><li> Apparently an attractive young woman in Germany boarded a city bus and was threatened with being thrown off for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL161097420070716">distracting the driver<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. For similar reasons, a court case in Illinois seems to suggest that <a class="urllink" href="http://jezebel.com/5802758/lawyer-objects-to-large-breasted-woman-in-courtroom">busty paralegals are a no-no<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In the late 1790s and early 1800s, Aaron Burr got a case of this trope due to two press moguls regularly writing news articles about how he was <em>too</em> attractive and obviously trying to tempt honest women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">(and men)</a> into sin, and characterizing his political followers as shallow young women and gay men who only cared about his looks. This contributed to the death of his reputation (albeit, there <em>were</em> other factors, but the press painting him as a sexual deviant due to being simply too pretty was certainly a part of it).
</li><li> There are several different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidIthaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidIthaveToBeSnakes">phobias</a> that can cause this to happen in some people's minds, such as agraphobia (fear of sexual abuse) and erotophobia (fear of sexual love). There may also be the fear of being seen as a sex object (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">Rulethirtyphobia</a>?).
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a>.com article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17061_5-things-you-think-will-make-you-happy-but-wont.html">5 Things You Think Will Make You Happy (But Won't)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent">...attractive people have the same self-esteem problems the ugly people do. Like money, attractiveness is relative and if you're hotter than your friends, at that stage you start comparing yourself to people in the media. You know, like the magazine covers we mentioned before, the ones that that have had the living shit Photoshopped out of them.
</div><div class="indent">It gets worse: You know how when the hot girl at the bar tells an unfunny joke, all the guys laugh anyway? Or when the office stud makes a mistake, the female boss laughs it off? Attractive people live in a world where most feedback they get is bullshit. The compliments mean nothing — they've learned that's just the sound people make when they walk by. That's why studies show they tend to dismiss the genuine compliments they get in other areas (their work, personality, sense of humor, creativity) because it gets lumped in with the same counterfeit flattery they've been getting their whole lives."

</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, you can find anti-bullying videos showing pictures of teenagers who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">died of suicide</a> because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">school bullying</a>. Sometimes, some commenters say stupid things like "that girl is too pretty for being bullied, this must be a joke, a good-looking person cannot be unhappy..." It doesn't occur to them that some kids may be bullied <em>because</em> other kids are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">envious of their good looks</a>.
</li><li> Lesbians who don't look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">butch</a> often find themselves being hit on by very persistent men. There are a lot of reasons for it, but one of the more commonly cited is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">But you're</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">too pretty</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">to be gay</a>." Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">Lipstick Lesbians</a> have reported a related problem — they find it hard to attract women because other lesbians assume they're straight girls who are "experimenting", stringing them along for fun or trying to titillate a boy. The gender inverse has been known to happen to gay men who don't act like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> stereotype. It even happens to <em>straight</em> men who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">too beautiful in a "feminine" way</a>, and are thus immediately assumed to be gay.
</li><li> According to the director, this was the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://jezebel.com/5850719/david-fincher--scarjo-was-too-sexy-for-dragon-tattoo-role">didn't get the role of Lisbeth Salander in the remake<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGirlWithTheDragonTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGirlWithTheDragonTattoo">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a></em>.
</li><li> While being an endangered ugly animal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">is often a death sentence</a>, endangered pretty/cute animals aren't always so secure. The demand for a threatened species' beautiful fur coat or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Parakeet">feathers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can result in heavy poaching, often with the rest of the parts of the animal getting wasted. There's also the pet trade, in which the cuter or more "majestic" animals tend to suffer the most by irresponsible owners (just ask the slow loris).
</li><li> Pretty celebrities and or pop stars who get proposed to by strangers because they're pretty or beautiful or popular or charismatic and never having known the person could be considered harassment for the celebrity and pop star. Certain websites have said (Shakesville) that this sort of public thing is peer pressure at its highest level... and they only get proposals because they're pretty or sweet or cute or popular. It is never appropriate or right to do this, no matter how "in love" you are with a person you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">never really knew</a>.
</li><li> British columnist <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2124246/Samantha-Brick-downsides-looking-pretty-Why-women-hate-beautiful.html">Samantha Brick<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> writes about how difficult it is being beautiful: strangers give her flowers, she gets free drinks on airlines, she doesn't have to pay for cab-fares, she's never been asked to be a bridesmaid for her less-attractive friends, and women hate her for no reason. When readers wrote into the magazine disputing her beliefs, Samantha's response was predictable: "they hate me because I'm beautiful."
<ul><li> Samantha may or may not be a card-carrying narcissist, but it is interesting to note that it is not uncommon for individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder to exaggerate, embellish, or outright invent stories about special treatment, idealized beauty, and the like. Her description of her extremely doting father, and his advice to her regarding naysayers ("Treat them with the contempt they deserve") certainly can call into question the veracity of her accounts, and the objectivity of her interpretations of events.
</li></ul></li><li> In traditional Chinese culture, girls who were exceptionally beautiful were said to have been given a gift by the gods, and in order to repay that gift, they were obligated to serve as prostitutes. Whether taken literally or used as a justification to force girls into prostitution, being beautiful could certainly suck. There's even a Chinese idiom that describes this trope, "hóng yán bó mìng" (红颜薄命) which means "beautiful women suffer unhappy fates".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-01/news/is-this-woman-too-hot-to-work-in-a-bank/">This woman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was apparently fired for being too hot. Similarly, a woman named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2327173/The-woman-claims-pretty-job-Graduate-hounded-sex-pests-jealous-females.html#ixzz2TrTqqfY4">Laura Fernee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claims that she has either had to quit—or not been hired in the first place—many jobs because she was subjected to constant harassment from male coworkers who wanted to get her into bed, or female coworkers jealous of her good looks. Another well-endowed woman had a potential employer outright tell her that he couldn't hire her because he was afraid of what his wife would think, no matter how genuinely qualified she was for the job.
</li><li> This may be part of the reason why any type of athletic endeavor that has a "artistic" or "beauty" slant to it has trouble being taken seriously, and a couple has had trouble being classified as a sport. A couple of examples:
<ul><li> Cheerleading. Cheerleading has been proven by statistics to be <em>the</em> most injury-laden and dangerous sport (since it's so high risk with very little in terms of protective gear.) However, cheerleaders still have trouble shaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader">their stereotypes</a>.
</li><li> Dance. In an effort to combat this, one season of <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> took their finalists to a sports science center and ran them through typical athlete fitness tests. Not only did they pass with flying colors, but they surprised a lot of people when they were putting up numbers comparable to those of pro athletes from the NBA and NFL.
<ul><li> After a terrible Philadelphia Eagles game, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> member snidely commented that "the Eagles played like they were wearing tutus." Incensed at this, a member of the Pennsylvania Ballet offered up a <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160107013235/http://www.someecards.com:80/news/sports/pennsylvania-ballet-eagles-play-like-they-were-wearing-tutus/">blistering editorial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that described how difficult the life of a ballerina was and suggested that the comment was an insult to the dancers rather than the football players, capping it off with this gem: "So no, the Eagles have not played like they were wearing tutus. If they had, Chip Kelly would still be a head coach and we'd all be looking forward to the playoffs."
</li></ul></li><li> Figure skating is seen as a "fluff" sport, due to the very subjective nature of scoring and the aesthetic appeal—the Ladies' event has been the draw of the Winter Olympics ever since its inception. However, every skater can attest to the fact that those jumps and turns are NOT easy, especially since they're done on <em>razor thin blades across a field of ice</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Three men from the United Arab Emirates were removed from a Saudi Arabian festival by religious police for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/16/three-emirati-men-ejected-saudi-arabian-festival-too-handsome_n_3091753.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG-8ZfN2VFK9wUEFxqrPdv59oyblS4W8Et9oivZEAac6BU8Gly90fi12vxNIYkXd0I0Ta2IjvkBMHd-jjuOWUbtlu9HjDHDyi6GVkxp8ydyPiE9j9de_ax57HLzOmD3lLkiy59AXUKyCZ0nP0U6bojQWP9pGF4BnStlVrqoZMTL_">being too handsome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/52696/revealed-man-deported-saudi-arabia-being-too-handsome">These three men<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were <em>deported</em> for the same reason.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a> shows everyone the dangers of mixing this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>. He'll say no to a sexual request at a convention (one example being getting on his knees and eating a sugar cube out of a girl's hand) but will get hammered into doing it anyway. Then there'll be posts declaring it his own fault for being "too conventionally pretty".
</li><li> Throughout history, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl">a beautiful slave</a> has never been a desirable position. Many beautiful female slaves were often lusted after by their masters, and rape was disturbingly common. Some women even resorted to scarring their own faces so that their beauty wouldn't attract attention and misery.
<ul><li> Frederick Douglass himself witnessed, at the age of just seven years after several weeks of being deemed "ready to work", his master "Captain" Aaron Anthony brutally whipping Douglass' own teenaged aunt, Hester, right in front of Douglass, frightening the child into a nearby closet until long after the display. Hester herself had been agreed by white and black women alike in the neighborhood as a girl whose beauty had "few peers and even fewer superiors"; Douglass himself describes her as a young woman of noble bearing and graceful form. Douglass leaves the reasons behind the beating of his aunt Hester open to conjecture, but Captain Anthony whipped Hester because he expressly told her not to let him find her in the company of Ned Roberts, a young man held as a slave on a neighbor's farm; Anthony likely lusted after Hester and she had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">sweethearts</a> with the boy next door.
</li></ul></li><li> A teenage girl in Argentina was assaulted by two jealous classmates who stabbed and slashed her, outright telling her that they hated her for being pretty and that "when we're done with you, you won't be pretty anymore." Indeed, though she survived the attack, she is likely to be permanently disfigured. Deals like this are, sadly, incredibly common among teenage girls: school girls who either are cuter/more popular than the standard or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl">develop breasts or height faster than others</a> tend to be bullied, isolated, insulted, falsely accused of being slutty, etc. by their envious classmates. The above mentioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em> example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>.
</li><li> A waitress at a Wessex restaurant had acid thrown in her face by her boss' wife, who was jealous of her youth and good looks.
</li><li> Many dog, cat, and horse breeds are maintained because of how they look without concern given to the health problems inherent in the breed or lurking in the gene pool. Some breeds even have problems directly caused by how they were bred to look. For example, show line German shepherds have trouble walking, white cats and dalmatians are prone to deafness, white horses may die soon after birth because of a nonfunctional colon, and pugs and Persian cats have breathing difficulties caused by the flat face, but those last two are more examples of "So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a> It's A Curse."
<ul><li> Even birds aren't free of this. Modena, a breed of fancy pigeon, has a tightly curved spine exacerbated by a very heavy breast- a painful combination achieved through years of selective breeding.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyCrawford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyCrawford">Cindy Crawford</a> didn't take too kindly to one reviewer of <em>Fair Game</em> claiming she was too beautiful to be plausible as a lawyer (not something Steven Bochco or David E. Kelley has ever had a problem with).
</li><li> In 1984, Olympic biathlete Kari Swenson was abducted while out for a training run. Her kidnappers, a father-and-son pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MountainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MountainMan">mountain men</a>, were looking for a bride for the son and outright told her that had she been unattractive, they would have let her go, but, "You're pretty, so we're going to keep you." Some attitudes after her rescue also displayed this, with comments suggesting that she shouldn't have been wearing running shorts. Never mind that it was the middle of summer and that she was, you know, <em>going out for a run.</em>
<ul><li> Similarly, in February 2011, journalist Lara Logan endured what was described as "a brutal and sustained sexual assault" while covering the Egyptian Revolution. There was a shocking lack of sympathy from people who suggested "she shouldn't have been out there dressed like that" (a perfectly respectable outfit of pants and shirt), or that with her good looks, she shouldn't have been outside at <em>all</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Some dating apps, such as the gay men's app Scruff, has a Global Users feature that shows you gorgeous people from all over the world. If the moderators like your pics, you too can be made Global and be shown to a wide variety of members. Unfortunately, this means you'll be messaged by every creep imaginable, and even the decent ones will most likely live hundreds or thousands of miles away, making it extremely unlikely that you'll ever actually be able to pursue them.
</li><li> Sadly, this may have been the case for <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Jennifer_Kesse">Jennifer Kesse in the years since her 2006 disappearance.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Shortly before she went missing, she had told her parents that she was afraid in her new apartment complex, which was a new building that few people had lived in at the time and said that the men working at the building would constantly stare at her. In the ensuing years after her disappearance, people have used her picture for their own profiles on numerous dating and <em>porn</em> websites. Even a news program had named an episode with her and another beautiful missing young woman "Stolen Beauty" (although subsequent re-airings of the episode changed its title.)
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4491914/Manchester-woman-says-good-looking-love.html">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> young woman claimed to have trouble getting a steady boyfriend because any man she was with was fixated with her looks, and nothing else. Any boys she does date end up seeing her just as a sex object.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel">Jessica Biel</a> has said that she's often denied auditions or been turned down for parts because of her beauty. To get a drastically against-type part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIllusionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIllusionist">The Illusionist</a></em> she had to drive to the audition in full 19th-century costume.

</li><li> Female professional volleyball player, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dbtechno.com/curiosity/2014/07/28/sabina-altynbekova-volleyball-volleyball-player-is-to-sexy-to-play/">Sabina Altynbekova<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, went viral on the internet because of her looks, being called one of the most beautiful women to ever play the game, with several men claiming that she is like an anime girl come to life. However, this has done nothing but bring her unwanted attention, from people not taking her seriously as an athlete, to fanboys creating creepy cult-like websites dedicated to worshiping her beauty. Altynbekova herself has said she wants to be famous for her ability as an athlete, not for her looks, and doesn't like the attention she has been getting for the wrong reasons.
</li><li> Early in her career <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly">Jennifer Connelly</a> was known primarily as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> — and many of her movies were marketed around her showcasing her beauty. This was in spite of critics praising her performances and saying she was better than the material. As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RequiemForADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RequiemForADream">Requiem for a Dream</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em> (which won her an Oscar), she was able to break away from this and become the respected actress she is today.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChanningTatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChanningTatum">Channing Tatum</a> was cast in a series of bland meathead roles that showcased his physique and very little else — even though films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGuideToRecognizingYourSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGuideToRecognizingYourSaints">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss">Stop-Loss</a></em> showed that he did have more to offer as an actor. He eventually won critics over with his performances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyOneJumpStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyOneJumpStreet">21 Jump Street</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicMike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicMike">Magic Mike</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Foxcatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Foxcatcher">Foxcatcher</a></em> — notably without having to go down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion">Beauty Inversion</a> route.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeLively" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeLively">Blake Lively</a> is a stunningly beautiful lady (with her page on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a> bearing a warning not to gush about her beauty) and naturally gets a lot of publicity for it. But she is first and foremost an actress and her early parts were of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> roles — including her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarMakingRole">Star-Making Role</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>. Fans and critics widely expected her to remain famous for her fashion and marriage to Ryan Reynolds. She was also able to transcend this — taking drastically against type roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTown">The Town</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hick">Hick</a></em> as well as winning acclaim for her performances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAgeOfAdaline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAgeOfAdaline">The Age of Adaline</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShallows">The Shallows</a></em>.

To end this, the prince wore a mask when on the battlefield so as to look more fearsome. By all accounts, it worked and enemies were terrified by the mask's inhuman appearance (the bulging eyes probably helped). A dance was later created to commemorate this victory: "The Prince of Lanling Enters the Fray" (兰陵王入阵曲, "Lan Ling Wang Ru Zhen Qu").
</li><li> Male celebrities with lots of fangirls can receive excessive amounts of unwanted attention — and plenty of perverted messages. Due to the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>, they're assumed to be okay with this.

She missed out on lots of good roles, studios preferring to stick her in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama">Costume Dramas</a> in what she called "poker up the arse parts".
<div class="indent"> "I came over here to act. It turns out all I needed to be was high-minded, long-suffering, white-gloved and decorative."

The notion that he had perhaps given a good audition and won the part on those merits appeared to be lost on most, despite endorsement from the director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a> (who has never had a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuntCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuntCasting">Stunt Casting</a>, mind you).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher">Carrie Fisher</a> talked about how she was not prepared for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> to make her into a sex symbol — claiming she would frequently get lewd comments from fans who fantasised about Princess Leia. The flipside to this is that when she aged, she got annoyed with people attacking her for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker">not being as beautiful as she once was</a>.

</li><li> Porn actresses and actors develop a very unnerving fanbase. Some of their fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">believe the storylines</a> and personally believe the unrealistic standards of sex and relationships<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dgez');"><sup> examples </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dgez" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dgez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> men can flirt their way out of any problem, sex solves everything and angry women are just sexually frustrated</span>.
</li><li> <em>Empire</em> magazine said of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopLoss">Stop-Loss</a></em> that its attractive cast was a "distraction".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaAlba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaAlba">Jessica Alba</a> wasn't too respected as an actress in the <em>Fantastic Four</em> movies, with the sequel nearly making her quit acting altogether. Critics said she was too beautiful to play Sue Storm and a large portion of her scenes were her in revealing clothing, in her underwear or outright naked. It was clear that she was mainly chosen as fanservice than for her acting abilities. According to Alba, she felt worthless on the set of "Rise of the Silver Surfer" because the director didn't want her to look realistic during an emotional scene, at one point alleging he told her "Don't do that thing with your face. Just make it look flat. We can CGI the tears in." She experienced something similar with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheBlue">Into the Blue</a></em>, where scenes were shot behind her back with a body double - forcing her to spend most of the movie in a bikini.
</li><li> Butterflies. Because they are so beautiful a lot of people like to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">stick them with needles</a> and mount them as decorations.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenzelWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenzelWashington">Denzel Washington</a> during his prime years in the 90s never liked or accepted the sexy male lead, heartthrob label he was given and saw it as a nuisance as it distracted from his ability as an actor. He would always say during interviews "No girls were banging down my door to date me when I was a nobody." And admitted that he was so into his craft that he hardly dated. Given that he met his wife on a blind date set up by one of his friends seems to confirm this, and he's been married to her since.
</li><li> Lizzy Caplan almost didn't get the role of "art freak" Janis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em> because they felt she was too pretty for it. But she was considered the best actress who auditioned for the part, so she was cast and the character was given an alternative goth look as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">trying to dress her down</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RossGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RossGrant">Ross Grant</a> often tells the story of how when he was working as a casting assistant, one beautiful actress gave a great audition. As soon as she was out of the room, the casting director sighed that she was perfect for the role but they couldn't cast her because she was too pretty.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">Keira Knightley</a> has a weird one. When considering her for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrideAndPrejudice2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrideAndPrejudice2005">Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005)</a></em>, Joe Wright worried that she was too glamorous to play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> like Lizzie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ivm3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8ivm3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ivm3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the book Lizzie <em>is</em> meant to be attractive, but she pales in comparison to her more beautiful older sister Jane</span>. According to Keira, as soon as he met her, he went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplimentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplimentBackfire">"oh no, you're fine"</a>.
</li><li> This happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonTate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonTate">Sharon Tate</a> in her all-too-brief career. She was annoyed by her role in <em>Don't Make Waves</em> had her mostly in a bikini and upset that the press would go on about her beauty and never took her seriously as an actress (something that she shared in common with her character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ValleyOfTheDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ValleyOfTheDolls">Valley of the Dolls</a></em>) to the point where some believed that it was the only reason she was famous. After her murder by the Manson Family, her heartbroken widower <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RomanPolanski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RomanPolanski">Roman Polanski</a> called them out of this, telling them how they always talked about how beautiful she was, but never about how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairOfGoldHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairOfGoldHeartOfGold">good</a></em> she was.
</li><li> Charles Perrault's interpretation of Red Riding Hood was based on this. His themes of sexuality within the story confused and unsettled the readers and Perrault had to clarify the moral of the story.
<div class="indent"> From this story one learns that children, especially young girls, pretty, courteous and well-bred, should never talk to strangers, for it is not unheard of for a wolf to provided with his dinner this way. I say "wolf", but not all wolves are of the same type; there is one kind with an amenable disposition neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, who follow girls in the streets and even into their homes, and it is these gentle wolves are most dangerous of all.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox">Megan Fox</a> said many times that she wanted to move past her typecasting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> but because she had three children to take care of - she had to continue playing roles that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">were guaranteed paychecks</a>.
<div class="indent"> "You have these stereotypes that still dominate films: the nag, the trophy, the escort...I haven't been sent a nag script yet but I do get plenty of like 'interesting stripper'."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardMadden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardMadden">Richard Madden</a> opened up and said that he struggled with body image issues thanks to becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a> via <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015">Cinderella (2015)</a></em> - being told to lose weight and go to the gym for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">Shirtless Scenes</a>.
<div class="indent"> "I find myself with actor friends  after weve done a kind of barely eating, working-out-twice-a-day, no-carbing thing for these scenes  looking at each other going: Were just feeding this same shit that were against.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett">Farrah Fawcett</a> lost a role or two in dramatic movies since, as one casting director said, "What man in his right mind would leave that?"
</li><li> E-girls receive an unnerving fanbase who throw compliments at them and genuinely believe the stage personas. In extreme cases; a man tried to sue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch">Twitch</a> because there was too many attractive people on it and some fans of gotten tattoos of their favourite livestreamers. These fanbases were the ones who popularised the slang term "Simp", a word describing a person who overvalues and defers to a woman, putting her on a pedestal.
