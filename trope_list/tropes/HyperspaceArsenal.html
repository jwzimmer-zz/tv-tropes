It doesn't limit their ability to run and jump and crawl through small spaces at all. What's more, when you see them during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a> in first-person games and third-person games, you can't see where they've stowed these things, even when they're wearing clothes that are more or less form-fitting. It seems they've put them away in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">same realm</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceMallet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceMallet">Hyperspace Mallets</a> are kept.
</p><p>In practice, a Hyperspace Arsenal serves to reduce the more annoying aspects of inventory management, removing the need to constantly shuffle stuff in and out of your backpack. Some games may choose to restrict inventory for balance reasons: It might upset the difficulty curve if the protagonist can carry around an infinite amount of healing items. This can be more realistic as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>'s rule of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout">no more than two weapons at once</a> or still kind of exaggerated, as in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame">Adventure Games</a>' "you can only carry twelve items"-type ruling. The result, more often than not, is the more annoying variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle">Inventory Management Puzzle</a> (and often leading to its own ridiculous situations — bazookas regularly take up as much space as gum wrappers, and in weapon-limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First Person Shooters</a> you might be able to carry around a rocket launcher and a heavy machine gun, but lord forbid you try to carry around three pistols).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fandom, this trope is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum">"justified"</a> with the supposition that the Hyperspace Inventory is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrouserSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrouserSpace">actually kept in the character's pants</a> (which actually serves to answer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">exactly none of the objections to the trope</a>). Some less-than-serious works, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimonTheSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimonTheSorcerer">Simon the Sorcerer</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a>,</em> take this very literally.
</p><p>The reverse occurs in many text adventures, where (primarily for design reasons) the player character could only carry a specific number of items (often five) at any one same time. Regardless of how large these items are.
</p><p>One odd effect of the Hyperspace Arsenal is that characters may struggle to support an item that they have "taken out" or "equipped," and they may not be able to wear something at all if they're not strong enough — yet presumably they're carrying this very item around all the time. Put another way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">as long as you can't see it</a>, it weighs nothing. (This could mean that the equipment is too heavy to be feasible in battle, though, again, this doesn't explain how you're lugging around a suit of full plate armor you're too weak to wear, as it is actually harder to carry a suit of full plate than it is to wear it)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Another odd effect, usually found in Adventure and Role-Playing games, is an inventory limit on a single kind of item. The classic example is being able to carry 99 healing Potions and 99 Antidotes, but not 198 Potions or even 100. Some games have even more stringent limits, which sometimes are item specific, and oftentimes aren't internally consistent (you might be able to carry around 50 healing potions, but only 10 healing herbs, because herbs are a different item category).
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedDisarming">Extended Disarming</a>, which often happens when a character is asked to empty out their hyperspace arsenal. Compare also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableLengthChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableLengthChain">Variable-Length Chain</a>, where chains and whips can "stretch" to attack a far target without being long when unused.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">Walking Armory</a>, where the character is actually shown carrying all of their weapons on their body, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout">Limited Loadout</a>, which is where there's a more (relatively) realistic limit to the number of weapons one can carry.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> tested whether the arsenal would significantly slow down an actual person who attempted to use this trope in Real Life. The answer was that an ordinary person would be significantly slowed by the extra gear, but a particularly athletic person (such as a professional MMA fighter) might be able to pull it off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters">Verdict: Plausible</a>.

<ul><li> The Court Record in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> can hold a surprising number of things... but this may not count, as most of what is in it are notes or facts describing the items in question, neither of which would actually take up much space. Still, it's hinted at least once that Phoenix has a large air tank in his <em>pockets</em>. Additionally, it's made explicit at one point that he's carrying around a large metal detector in his pants. Make of that what you will.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em>
<ul><li> The series wouldn't work without this trope. On top of the ludicrously high number of missiles and special weapons (the most heavily-armed real-world fighter planes can only hold about 8 to 14 maximum; the low-end planes in these games <em>start</em> with at least 40 regular missiles, and by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizon">Assault Horizon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity">Infinity</a></em> you can easily go over <em>200</em>, to say nothing of the dozens of special missiles on top of that), if you use third-person view and move the camera underneath the plane, you can even see weapons <em>magically</em> reappear once they're available for firing again.
</li><li> Operation Katina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5</a></em> has much stricter limits than the normal games - you start with just 20 missiles and a single salvo of its special weapon (e.g. four XMAA's). There are certain enemies you can destroy which replenish one of the two (10 missiles or another salvo of special weapons), but that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">something entirely different.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust">Vector Thrust</a></em>, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em>Ace Combat</em>, relies heavily on this trope as well. There's even a mutator for Skirmish mode that lets you regenerate ammo with each kill.
</li><li> There is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3925241/1/The_Ultimate_Ace">a fanfic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a writer rewrote <em>Ace Combat 5</em> if it and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04</a></em> had to adhere to real-life limits; for example it's the F/A-18 Hornet fighters from the aircraft carrier <em>OFS Kestrel</em> that attack an enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade">Naval Blockade</a> early on while Wardog Squadron merely flies air cover, and Mobius One didn't destroy Stonehenge by himself, despite newspaper claims to the contrary.
</li></ul></li><li> The player's inventory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea">Achaea</a></em>, as in most MUDs, is effectively infinite, and can hold (among other things) <em>mounts</em>. A character suddenly producing a full-size winged horse from his backpack is not regarded as odd. Herbs have to be kept in the Rift, however, which can only hold a few thousand units of each type.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner">After Burner</a></em> series has your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Cool Plane</a> start out with <em>50</em> missiles, way more than a real-life fighter plane can carry. And in <em>After Burner Climax</em>, they regenerate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirRivals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirRivals">Air Rivals</a></em> features one-man fighters that can potentially carry several hundred thousand missiles each. Of course, those same inventory slots could be used for 60 sets of armor plating that are each as big as the craft itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation">Alien: Isolation</a></em>: By the midway point of the game, Amanda will be carrying a large amount of weapons and equipment which is not reflected on her character model, including several different types of weapons, multiple tools (including a maintenance jack, ion torch, hacking tuner and motion tracker), ammunition, scrap metal, and various items that are crafted into medkits and offensive devices. This is even exemplified at one point. When Amanda reaches <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the APOLLO core</span>, she pauses at the entrance to the level to put her weapons through a scanning machine, pulling out a bulky flamethrower, shotgun and revolver seemingly out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">Hammerspace</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCenturysEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCenturysEpisode">Another Century's Episode</a></em> uses this one. Most hand-carried weapons simply appear out of thin air when used (often replacing the weapon your unit is <em>already</em> carrying), then are gone just as quickly. When using melee attacks, the primary weapons simply disappear... Only to reappear if needed as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingAttack">Evolving Attack</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode">Another Code</a></em>: Like a good adventure game protagonist, Ashley has no problem carrying around loads of random junk she finds. It does make for at least one odd instance in the second game when she goes to return a briefcase and pulls out from behind her back. Unless you can buy that she had a regular-sized briefcase in that little fanny pack of hers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA">ARMA</a> II</em> and its <em>Operation Arrowhead</em> expansion have a form of this: most weapons that can load multiple types of magazines only have one actual model for those magazines. Hence, you can load a 100-round Beta C-mag into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">XM8</a> and watch as it turns into a regular thirty-rounder that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">somehow holds 100</a>.
<ul><li> <em>ARMA III</em> has its own application of this with regards to wetsuits. They're practically a requirement for operations that require going underwater for any length of time, but they're also not armored in any meaningful fashion. To compensate for this, and purely as a gameplay mechanic, they're given a much higher carrying capacity than they rightly should have, enough for the player to hold both a dedicated underwater firearm for the actual swimming <em>and</em> a regular weapon to switch to once they get on land.

And these are all 1960-level technology, so these things are pretty big and clunky — the radio is as big as a dictionary, the camera the size of a human head. And for each weapon you carry three types of ammunition, and that <em>too</em> is big and clunky.

Since there are about twenty weapons but only ten number keys, if a player comes across a new gun they want, they'd have to drop one they're already holding to make room for it. Of course, as noted, you're still toting around 10 weapons at one time (a knife and nine guns, some of which can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual-wielded</a> without taking up extra space).

A cheat code makes the weapons visible on Rayne, and it becomes obvious why they're invisible by default; it looks ridiculous and extremely cumbersome.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> the characters use a "Storage Deck", a literal Hyperspace Arsenal, to lug all your their around. Storage Decks have limited carrying capacity to start with: 12 inventory items, a rather low amount of each type of ammo, and two "active" guns to start with. As you progress through the game these limits increase, via the use of "Storage Deck Upgrades", or SDUs, to 42 inventory items (obtained by rescuing Claptraps), 4 active weapons (obtained by default in the main quest), and a ton of ammo for each weapon (obtained by buying Ammo SDUs at Ammo Vendors).
<ul><li> Those players with the <em>Mad Moxxxi's Underdome Riot</em> DLC have access to the Bank, where you can stash the guns that you want to keep for certain situations.

However, the other DLCs made this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> due to there being no Fast Travel within the DLC's areas themselves.

<ul><li> In addition, there is the Bank in Sanctuary in <em>2</em> and in Concordia in <em>Pre-Sequel</em> (upgradable with SDUs from Crazy Earl, natch) where you can store guns that you can have use for at a later time. This is now Awesome AND Practical for DLC, since you can Fast Travel between all the known DLC locations.
</li><li> And then there's the Stash (also in Sanctuary/Concordia). Put in up to four guns that your character can't use well. Load or start another character. Anytime that character is in Sanctuary/Concordia, they can grab any of the guns in the stash and use them.
</li><li> Even the <em>vending machines</em> are a limited version of this: Found some loot that you want to sell but don't have the room for in your backpack? As long as your backpack isn't overloaded (can happen with quest and challenge rewards), you can sell some of your current equipment. Then you can grab the gear, sell THAT and then <em>buy back</em> the gear you originally sold at the same price. Your sold gear is held in the vendor for as long as you remain on the same map.

Aside from armor, the player can only carry two items for each hand (anything from weapons to shields to magic catalysts and the like,) four quick-slot items, and two magic rings. There's also weight limits to deal with.

Almost every infantry unit possesses a ranged weapon and a melee weapon (with the exception of all Necron and Imperial Guard units whose weapons are dual-purpose), switching between the two as appropriate, however most of them are only seen carrying their ranged weapon when idle or when firing, pulling their melee weapon from nowhere while their ranged weapon disappears. <em>Dawn of War 2</em> averts both, only the melee specialists possessing a dedicated melee weapon (a lot of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndGun">are still used at the same time as their gun</a>) while other infantry use their weapon as a club or merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a>.

In the first two games, Dante can hold his pistols, a shotgun and an explosive launcher, as well as other not-so-easily-classified weapons on his person. The third game, where one is limited to two melee and two ranged weapons, would appear to be more realistic... until one realises that Dante can hold two back-covering scimitars, a full-sized electric guitar, a hundred-pound anti-tank sniper rifle and a massive rocket launcher with attached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">grappling hook</a>. The fourth game goes to three melee weapons and three ranged weapons (at least for Dante), with the Pandora's Box literally reshaping itself via demonic tech into the desired mode. Even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>-capable flying battle station that Dante can sit in.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> follows this trope to the extent that characters have ten different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory">inventory slots</a> holding up to nine different categories of items, including armor and heavy weapons; so if every slot is full, your character is carrying 9 helmets, 9 sets of chest armor, 9 rocket launchers/ machine guns/ swords, 9 rifles... and so on. Possibly justified given that in-universe, the technology exists to de-materialize matter, store it as patterns, and call it back; so the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Ghost</a> could manage their inventory, keeping spare equipment digitized and pulling it up as needed.

Ammo though had its own inventory system independent of the main one. This leads to some weirdness, such as items taking more room in the inventory than in-game (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Dragon's Tooth Sword</a>, which is clearly shown to have a retractable blade when drawn or put away but is stored fully-formed solely to waste inventory space), and others that have effects that only show up when the weapon is equipped, such as the GEP gun, which slows the player to a crawl when equipped, but causes no such problem when tucked away.

Ammo is still its own separate inventory, but the game uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">Universal Ammunition</a> system where everything that requires ammo, from dinky silenced pistols to massive rocket launchers, draws from the same pool, with bigger and stronger weapons taking a greater reserve per shot.

You start out with a third of your maximum inventory space available - enough to hold two or three small guns, a single rifle, a few odds and ends and a couple batteries. Later on, you can strengthen your arms via augmentation to greatly increase your capacity, letting you carry multiple heavy weapons, pistols, batteries...you name it. Yet, Adam has nothing more than his armblades on in the cutscenes. In contrast to the first though, ammo takes up space as well, forcing the player to be a bit more choosy.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> games have different inventory areas, each with a different amount of limited space, that represent easily-accessed belt pouches, holding space in a backpack, a treasure chest in town, etc. You still never <em>see</em> this backpack, and it can comfortably hold multiple suits of full plate armor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, the player acquires literal (in-universe) hyperspace called the Horadric Cube. This item takes up four squares in the player's inventory, but opens up to reveal twelve squares of internal storage.
</li><li> The first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> games have a ready-made justification taken straight from the source material, in the form of The Luggage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDittyOfCarmeana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDittyOfCarmeana">The Ditty of Carmeana</a></em>, a game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">the hero can only carry ten</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">frequent-flyer miles</a>, has said hero somehow carry <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">an entire freaking refrigerator</a></em> in his inventory.
</li><li> The MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus">Dofus</a></em> has a theoretical limit of weight: each item has a size, measured in "pods", which vary from 1 (most common components) to 100 (some very rare items). You can only transport 1000 pods of materials, which is huge by itself, since it means 200 pieces of wood. But... You gain 5 pods from every point you spend in strength (which can top several hundred with the good equipment). You gain 5 pods for every job level. When you reach lvl 100 in a job, you gain an additional 1000 pods. And you can have <em>three</em> jobs. There's a pet who can give you an additional 1000 pods. And also numerous items, who give you more pods: a low-level belt offers you 500 pods, and the best backpack in the game can go up to <em>1200 pods</em>. And that's without counting houses' storage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> has always adhered to this trope. For example, by the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, you're carrying a handgun, a shotgun, a machine gun, a chaingun, a bunch of grenades, a plasma rifle, a rocket launcher, a chainsaw, a PDA, a flashlight, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> whose barrel alone is bigger than a microwave oven, not to mention all the attendant ammunition, which can include fifty or so rockets and several BFG fuel cells the size of your head. Then in the cutscenes the character is seen carrying naught but a dinky shotgun. If you change weapons while standing in front a mirror, Doomguy will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantsPositiveSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantsPositiveSafety">pull the weapon out of his pants pocket</a> while the previous weapon vanishes into thin air.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em>, if anything, goes <em>even further</em>. In addition to almost all the equipment mentioned above, you've also got a double-barreled shotgun, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">Gauss cannon</a>, and a bunch of weapon attachments. Given that the main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wears magic demon-forged armor, has Seraphim enhancements, and</span> is implied to be something beyond human, his Hyperspace Arsenal is presumably part of his powerset.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>: Every different item type takes up the same space in your inventory. That is to say 99 Health Poultices takes up the same space as 1 Health Poultice. Each weapon and armor piece also takes up an inventory space on its own. By the way, you start out with an inventory limit of 70 and it can go up to 125 with backpacks. So in theory you could lug around hundreds of potions and dozens of weapons and pieces of armor. Plot-relevant items don't take up any space either. Of course the only things you see on your characters are equipped items.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> series limits the number of items your party can carry including your equipment in battle. Some of the early games have a vault to store your items. Since then, you carry a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> with no limit of items you can carry. If the player party's inventory is full, additional items are placed into the bag. Items in your bag cannot be used during battle.
</li><li> Caim can carry eight weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em>. "Only eight?" you might ask, but given some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">odd dimensions</a> of some of them, and the fact that no one of human stature could comfortably carry three axes and four staffs whilst fending off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilArmy">entire armies of baddies</a>...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dubloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dubloon">Dubloon</a></em>, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSharing">inventory</a> can hold up to 4 pages of items. It doesn't count <em>how</em> many of each item you have however, so you can end up with 99 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">Shake-Bombs</a> and still have space for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism">a jerky</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a></em> sort of plays and averts this one. Although your inventory is grid-based, your speed is never affected by how much you're carrying, and the only thing you can see in your character, just like in <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Oblivion</em>, is your armor and your currently equipped weapon. However, as you keep stashing your items into your packmules, you can see how the stack of bags and crates they're carrying starts growing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</a></em> plays this straight, with each Mobile Suit pulling new weapons out of thin air for their appropriate attacks. The one aversion is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Full Armor Unicorn</a> in <em>Reborn</em>, which not only has all its heavy ordinance visible on its model, but averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a> and discards each as it's used up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> downplays this to some extent: all items have weight, and adventurers will be slowed down if they try to carry too much, where "too much" is based on their body size, strength and toughness stats. However, there is no actual limit to the amount of items an adventurer can carry in their backpack, and there is a minimum speed where they cannot be slowed down any further, no matter how many additional items they are carrying. This can include things like multiple sperm whale corpses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> acknowledges the problem by using a courier service to drop off and pick up items that the characters don't have room to carry — but then again, a packet of salt seems to occupy the same space in the characters' pocket as a bazooka, or even a bicycle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthDefenseForce">Earth Defense Force</a></em>: Players can carry a variety of rather huge weapons that would be both heavy and cumbersome to haul around but can readily switch between them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Throughout the series, the only real limit on what you can carry is your "Encumbrance" limit, determined by your Strength attribute (and Stamina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>). You can have an infinite number of items on your person (including numerous large weapons, sets of armor, thousands of arrows, enough food to feed an army, enough books to fill a library, gallons of potions, literally millions of gold coins, etc.) and none of it will show unless you specifically equip them. As long as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalEncumbranceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalEncumbranceFailure">combined weight of the items</a> is below your Encumbrance limit, you can move around without issue. (And <em>Skyrim</em> changes the system so that you can't <em>run</em> while over-encumbered, but you can still <em>walk</em>. You can carry literally billions of tons of items and move, albeit it at a snail's pace.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> you can't pass a row of shrubbery while on a horse. So you have to get off the horse, jump over it, and get on again. At this point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> suggests horses are kept in the hyperspace arsenal too, thus making Tamriel horses infinitely more awesome than Earth horses. It's also possible to climb up a city walls from the outside, climb down on the inside, and <em>get on your horse</em>. It goes even further by allowing you to carry a cart which has a ludicrous weight limit which you could take anywhere (including the wall climbing trick mentioned above) except inside dungeons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEnchantedCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEnchantedCave">The Enchanted Cave</a></em> lets you carry lots of weapons, armor, healing items and crafting items.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII">EverQuest II</a></em>, your character is limited to what he can carry by their strength. But, after gaining no more than thirty levels or so, assuming you're not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> type, you'll be easily able to carry six solid steel, 100lb strongboxes full of junk. Harvestables in the game also have a negligible weight and can stack in to groups of 100, so you can carry tens of thousands of units of rocks, precious minerals, gemstones and lumber without any decrease in movement speed. Also, you are able to craft and carry around furniture, even going so far as being able to fit two dozen full-sized four post beds inside one of the aforementioned strong boxes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable</a></em> the character cannot properly carry around a weapon if it is too heavy, but can carry around an apparently unlimited amount of weaponry, food, augments, etc. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> you can carry around <em>freakin' furniture</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> this with the perk Pack Rat (which increases your carrying capacity); the picture for it showed Vault Boy stuffing a grandfather clock into his backpack. The second game was particularly odd in that the trunk of the car could carry any amount of items as long as its very high weight capacity wasn't exceeded, but if an item would exceed it, the game told you that there was no more <em>space</em> in the trunk. This leads to some of the best animations ever, such as when the Vault Dweller pulls a Bozar out of his/her pants with a distinct heaving motion.
</li><li> The player's inventory itself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> is limited by weight, but <em>ammunition and chems don't weigh anything</em>. Thus, you can be carrying so much that a single knife slows you down, but you can still pick up 500 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition (or 500 rockets, for that matter) no problem. Much worse even, though there is a carrying limit, it is usually ridiculously high - you start with a base 150-pound limit and can carry 10 more pounds for each point in the Strength stat. A character with a decent strength score has no problem carrying all kinds of firepower, including a miniature nuke catapult, a small assortment of chosen melee weapons and can still pick up an entire wardrobe of combat armor and several backpacks full of loot, and all you can see of it is what the character is currently wearing and armed with. This has the added charm of being able to stuff a rocket launcher inside a first aid kit or the <em>eyeball</em> from a dead Raider.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>'s</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Hardcore</a> mode has ammo take up weight, although stimpaks, chems, and a few other small items are still "weightless" without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">game mod</a> like one made by the game's director J.E. Sawyer. One odd bit outside Hardcore mode is that, while the fully-formed ammo itself is weightless, unformed lead to make more bullets with is not - although it weighs so little that you have to be carrying 714 units of it, enough to craft an average of 44 rounds for any standard ammo type, to have a full pound of it. Even more bizarre is that all of the other components to make ammo - casings, gunpowder and primers - are weightless even <em>in</em> Hardcore. This has lead to some Hardcore players breaking down the majority of their ammo if they don't need it so they technically have it on-hand without eating into their carrying capacity..
</li><li> Averted even harder with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>'s Version 1.5 Survival Mode overhaul, where ammo weight is more significant than in <em>FONV</em> Hardcore, e.g. Mini-Nukes weigh <em>12</em> pounds a piece, Stimpaks and other drugs have weight as well, and the player's base carrying capacity is reduced like in the <em>FONV</em> J.E. Sawyer Mod, limiting you to carrying about two or three weapons at a time.
</li><li> Half-Brother <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel">Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</a></em> uses a weight system. Carrying too much slows down a character, and eventually stops them moving at all. That doesn't stop you parking a waif in the exit scenario area and then getting other characters to load them up with a dozen heavy machine guns and a score of assault rifles - and they will somehow manage to carry them all back to your base when the rest of the squad joins them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em> only lets you carry 3 weapons at a time, but places no limit on how <em>big</em> those weapons can be. Your character can thus carry the 3 biggest guns in the game, the rocket launcher, repeating cannon and energy beam weapon, all at the same time. It's notable that the first 2 weapons on that list are almost as big as the character himself, but they will only slow him down if he is physically carrying one of them in his hands - holster them all to fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> and you can move faster than most enemies in the game. <em>F.E.A.R. 2</em> ups the number of weapons to 4, and still has no limit on how big they are - holding the missile launcher, .50-cal sniper rifle, pulse weapon and napalm launcher all at the same time is still fair game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>
<ul><li> The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> does it both ways, giving players a bottomless joint inventory for consumable items, but providing a extremely small inventory for equippable items, which each character must carry separately. Some dungeons have so many equippable items that multiple trips are necessary to loot the dungeon without having to throw some of the equipment away!
</li><li> Further sequels have a giant chocobo acting as storage for your extra units, but you can still carry a ridiculous amount of stuff with you. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, your party can be lugging 99 of <em>everything</em> (potions, swords, various things you can throw at the enemy, <em>and</em> armor) and enough money to ruin the world economy several times over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight">Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</a></em> tries to limit things by limiting the player to 15 items per character, but there's nothing theoretically stopping you for, for instance, carrying around 15 axes. And then there are the hundreds of gems you end up lugging around by the end of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, enemy units have infinite stores of consumable items and throwable weapons; you can exploit the latter with the Thief reaction skill "Catch" to get unlimited quantities of otherwise rare or one-of-a-kind items.
</li><li> One particular scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> shows Auron handing Tidus a sword we didn't see beforehand, before pulling out his own. Yuna also gets a mention for having her staff appear while decked out in wedding garb.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, Larsa has an infinite supply of potions (unless you're playing the International Version, in which case he uses yours).
</li><li> Many of the characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> games seem to be able to summon their weapons at will. The notable exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Firion</a>, who is seen to carry seven weapons around with him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">at all times</a>. Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Vaan</a> is a particular offender, being able to wield even more weapons than Firion, but he summons them as he needs them (in fitting with his gimmick of switching between weapons for better attacks). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Bartz</a> at least has possible excuse that the weapons that he summons are but imitations of those of his teammates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">and so may not be useable by anyone else for any other purpose</a>.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>.

In addition to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>, this also gives him the ability to carry his weapons around this way, materializing them if and when needed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">Gaia Online</a> zOMG</em>: Ignoring the fact that most players routinely carry copious amounts of clothing, weapons, armor, animals, and on occasion <em>children</em> in their inventory as costume items, many attacks involve pulling a weapon from nowhere, using it, and then having it disappear almost instantly. This is explained away as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">G'hi</a> energy being manipulated by the character's rings to form the weapon. But in a game that has you killing plungers and lawn gnomes, a Hyperspace Arsenal only adds to the charm. (Plus the ring that lets you fire 4 guns at once is <em>really</em> cool.)
</li><li> The main character in the videogame version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> keeps a massive arsenal — a shotgun, 2 handguns, a Tommy gun, garrote wire, 1 stick of dynamite, 4 Molotovs, 1 bomb, and a burning two by four in some versions, along with all the attendant ammo — inside of his shirt. Plus you can upgrade your Street Smarts to increase the carry limit on your throwables, and upgrading your weapons increases the max ammo capacity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> allows Mr. Bond to carry all weapons available in the game without trouble, which includes stuff like rocket and grenade launchers. Through some exploits, it's possible to see cutscenes of Bond, say, stuffing a rocket launcher down his pants and having it magically disappear before he leaves.
</li><li> Arthur from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> can produce an infinite number of lances from nowhere, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades">to which they quickly return</a>. And judging that he can still hang onto them when he loses his armor, the only logical explanation is that he keeps them in his boxers.
</li><li> The hero in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a></em> series can carry an infinite amount of anything he finds. It is not unusual to be carrying large quantities of weapons, a dozen suits of armour, and enough various foodstuffs to feed an army for a year. This is even more noticeable in <em>Gothic 3</em> where some of the carryable items include large crates full of (presumably) heavy goods, barrels full of fish, and unbelievably large plants which have somehow never even been flattened when the hero takes them back out to eat them.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">heroes</a>" of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series find room for a very large arsenal in their pants. Niko Bellic, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>, for example, is capable of carrying a pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, <em>a rocket launcher</em>, 25 grenades, and a baseball bat, along with enough ammunition for each to take out a small army. In fact, since C.J. (the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>) is capable of changing his clothes, he could conceivably be carrying around a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and an assortment of other weapons in his <em>boxers.</em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by allowing players to keep every variety of weapon, with the various protagonists of Story Mode and <em>GTA: Online</em> keeping as many as 14 different melee weapons, 11 pistols including a stun gun and a flare gun, 5 submachine guns, 7 shotguns including a musket, 6 assault rifles, 3 light machine guns, 3 sniper rifles, 6 varieties of heavy weapons including 4 different explosive launchers, a minigun and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">a railgun</a>, along with 5 different thrown explosives. And that's not even mentioning the potential maximum ammo count of <em>9999 bullets per weapon category</em> and 25 of each thrown explosive.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango">Grim Fandango</a></em>, Manny Calavera tucks all manner of bulky items, from fire extinguishers to metal detectors, inside his jacket. Then again, he <em>does</em> have a hollow torso... One notable item is a scythe, taller than he is, which he carefully folds up first.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series demonstrates this trope particularly well. The player character, Gordon Freeman, typically starts off with a crowbar, then expands his inventory to include a pistol, a revolver, at least two types of machine guns, hand grenades, a rocket launcher, and many more. The first game in the series is the worst perpetrator, as there are more weapons to collect as well as a much higher limit on how much ammunition can be carried, including but not limited to what is essentially a nuclear cannon (with boxes of depleted uranium for ammunition) attached to a backpack-sized generator. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> cleverly masquerading as a hazard suit makes the weight issue more believable, but not where he puts all of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> allows you to carry just two weapons and about eight grenades, although you can also carry as many as four steamer trunk-sized boxes of rockets along with your 4 foot long rocket launcher. You <em>are</em> usually playing as a genetically-engineered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour">Powered Armour</a> strong enough to flip over <em>tanks</em>; the only issue is where the ammo goes. Games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> onward further avert this, with both of the player's weapons being visible (unless you pick up a turret), though they still have no ammo pouches. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> employee once explained Master Chief's ability to just stick a gun on his back as being a result of his armor being magnetized in some way. On the ammo and grenade supply: "Who knows? It's magic." This example is conspicuous because a large fraction of the serious-shooter gaming-industry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">followed Bungie's lead</a> in limiting the player's arsenal, thus making this trope less common in the genre.
</li><li> An exception is the videogame version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>. Arthur Dent can only carry a limited number of items and will start dropping other items if this limit is reached. The Hyperspace Arsenal is then Handwaved once the purpose of the Thing Your Aunt Gave You Which You Don't Know What It Is is discovered. It is basically <em>something</em> in which every item, with the exception of the spare improbability drive, can be placed. If the item is dropped it will magically return to your inventory a few turns later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanCodename47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanCodename47">Codename 47</a></em>, the eponymous character can put certain small items away inside his jacket. When he switches to swimming trunks in order to infiltrate a sauna, the same animation of him putting things away into his jacket is used, making it look like he reaches inside his own chest.
</li><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Silent Assassin</a></em>, takes the middle road. You can only carry a single "large" weapon, be it a Katana, an AK-47, or an anti-materiel rifle — but you can still stuff a <em>lot</em> of small arms inside your shirt: 3 different knives, 8 pistols, a revolver, a small SMG, a sawed-off shotgun, a bottle of anaesthetic and his trademark piano-wire. Also notable is that he can apparently transfer this entire arsenal to the jacket of another disguise in a matter of seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Blood Money</a></em> went marginally more reasonable by only allowing 47 to start out a mission with one handgun, one SMG, and one unconcealable weapon alongside his non-gun equipment. Any collected handguns and SMGs can still be concealed on 47's person, but the inclusion of an ICA weapons storage crate could allow the player to feign realism.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HotelDuskRoom215" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HotelDuskRoom215">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LastWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LastWindow">Last Window</a></em> isn't quite as bad about it as other games, as the items Kyle carries are mostly small enough that he could easily carry the majority of them in his pockets and even puts some away when he's done with them, but towards the end, the sheer number does get a little silly. A much more obvious and ridiculous moments comes in <em>Last Window</em> where he has to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything</a> and actually do his job as a salesman, which involves shoving every potential product into his inventory at once, enough to fill a small cardboard box and including two large bottles of laundry soap, and still walk around just fine.
</li><li> The Infinity Engine games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, and so on) use this indiscriminately. Each character is given a carry weight and twenty inventory slots. It doesn't matter if it's the shell of an ankheg (bug so large the exoskeleton alone of weighs 50 pounds) or a single, tightly-rolled scroll (effectively weightless). The weight limit believably penalizes weaker characters, who end up carrying a lot of gems and scrolls if you spend a lot of time away from settlements with stores. The space penalty was less believable on stronger characters, who could carry as many gems and scrolls as the weaker characters—and nothing more except the equipment on their person.
<ul><li> <em>Baldur's Gate II</em> also had several in-universe items that allowed the player to access hyperspace storage. The Bag of Holding is found midway through the game, and allows the player to dump scores of armor sets, weapons and various items into it, making it much easier to cart around large amounts of goods. The Bag/Case/Quiver of Plenty also allowed the player to have unlimited bullets, bolts and arrows, respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> Reconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em>, as the title character only carries one gun, but that gun can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyGun">rearrange its insides</a> to make different weapons, whether Iji picks them up or combines two other guns; switching to another gun requires brief cooldown period. By the end of the game, it's possible to have sixteen weapons, ranging from shotguns and machine guns to triple rocket launchers and <em>automatic</em> shotguns to plasma cannons and explosive lasers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">weapons normally reserved for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">space combat</a></em>.

</li><li> Appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a></em>, where Gage can carry a rather impressive number of items, including a hand-sized key, some huge wire cutters, and a stun gun, all while wearing a skin-tight Biosuit. The remake gives him larger items, and turns the stun gun from a pistol into a rifle, but no new pockets to carry the stuff. <em>Buried in Time</em> features a diagram of the Jumpsuit in the manual, with one thing labeled "Null-Time Pocket Generator," likely an interdimensional pocket as a better excuse for carrying all this junk than most point-and-click adventure games have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause</a> 2</em> averts this with weapons; Rico can only carry three at a time (all three of which are visible on his person at all times), with a reasonable amount of ammo for each one. But he can summon up a parachute from his backpack, throw it away, and create another one an unlimited number of times. Also done inconsistently with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">arm-mounted grappling hook</a>, which is clearly shown to have a limited range, but can actually shoot out the <em>entire</em> line, both ends tied to different things, and still be able to use it as soon as that line snaps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> does this a lot. Almost every character is able to bring out their weapon out of nowhere at a moment's notice and then make it disappear again just as quickly. Granted, Sora and the other Keybearers can summon Keyblades via magic, likewise with the Organization and their weapons. Unlike many other video games, the weapon upgrades are easily portable <em>keychains</em>, not entirely new weapons. (Well, Donald and Goofy are the exception to this, but they're classic toons anyway)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>'s developers considered having a limited inventory at some point, but all that's left of this idea is a few rare "container" items, which were eventually converted into items for the newly-introduced "back" slot. Currently, your character can carry any number of different items, and <em>billions</em> of copies of any of them—even stuff like wedding cakes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">"ridiculously huge swords,"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Lego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Lego">BRICKO</a> constructions the size of aircraft carriers—without becoming encumbered in the slightest.

Each survivor can carry one primary weapon as well as a pair of pistols or a melee weapon, a medkit, defibrillator or explosive/incendiary ammo pack for four people, a grenade and a bottle of painkillers or adrenaline injector. All of a character's equipment is shown on the model, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">the ammo seems to be stored in hyperspace</a>.

This is explicitly expanded, with regards to bombs, arrows, and Rupees, by several fairies and items in later titles. Perhaps even stranger, Link has kept iron boots and a huge ball and chain, both of which slow the character down immensely—when they're equipped. As soon as he puts them away, their weight disappears. It's kind of amusing to watch Link stand on a giant button, which doesn't shift under his weight, then change into his heavy metal boots, causing the button to sink.

For those of you playing at home, that's a sword, a shield, a bow, a wand, a bracelet, a boomerang, a flute, a jar, a bomb, a key, a book, a ladder, a raft, and two different types of arrows. By all the laws of nature he should be over encumbered. And that's nothing compared to the later titles.

He's trying to punish you for waking him up from a great nap, and from his perspective he's doing so by giving Link a ton of extra shit you have to carry around everywhere, unaware that it doesn't encumber him in the slightest.

The mask salesman, oddly, needs a comically oversized backpack for his collection, even though Link carries dozens of masks apparently between the fibers of his tunic.

Visually, he still pulls impossible things from his back pouch. Notably, his inventory in this game includes two items that slow him down when he has them equipped but don't when he doesn't: the iron boots and the ball-and-chain.

Some items are also too big to be carried by Link himself. There is, however, a point where Link reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fruit picked from the Tree of Life—an item that's nearly as big as <em>he</em> is. One must wonder if those Adventure Pouches are actually small Bags of Holding.

Tommy Angelo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">longcoat</a> is large enough to hide five pistols, one two-handed weapon (shotgun, Tommy gun or a baseball bat) and about five magazines for each weapon. That's quite a lot, but reasonably fittable under a longcoat with a sufficient number of pockets. The longcoat does not appear nearly as bulky as should, and the rattling of all the metal might sound quite suspicious, but then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">it's a videogame after all</a>.
</li><li> While the inventory <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> is suitably huge, previous to the Big Bang patch you end up holding so many doodads (especially if you have several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a> quests running or you're hoarding drops <em>just in case</em>) that you'll find yourself hurting for space very, very quickly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> paid no attention to weapon or ammunition bulk/capacity, allowing all possible weapons (including rocket launcher, assault machine gun, and flamethrower) to be carried simultaneously. When set to Total Carnage difficulty, the game also allows you to carry unlimited ammo. And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Marathon: Evil</a></em>, instead of a rifle, you have a freaking GATLING GUN. Surprisingly becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted Trope</a> in the chapter screens, which almost always depict the Security Officer as having multiple weapons visible on his body
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> both averts and falls victim to this trope:
<ul><li> All weapons in the game are capable of collapsing to roughly half their normal size. Those you have equipped on your person simply clip onto several hardpoints of your body armor and switching between them takes a few moments, requiring the player to think strategically. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Ammunition is a non-issue</a> since all guns work on a sophisticated system that simply shaves tiny chunks off an inserted cube of metal and propels them via a miniature mass accelerator - it takes <em>days</em> of continued fighting for a gun to run dry.
</li><li> On the other hand, you can also carry up to 150 other items on your person at all times, including guns, upgrades, and even entire suits of body armor. It is stated in the codex that all upgrades consist of computerized blueprints and some specialized parts, with omni-gel used to affix them, but the weapons and armor are still physical objects.
</li><li> The sequels avert this by ditching inventories altogether. Every weapon must be equipped before each mission, and the rest are kept on the <em>Normandy</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> tucks his Berettas, Desert Eagles, shotguns, Ingrams, Kalashnikov, Jackhammer, grenades, Molotov cocktails etc, into his trenchcoat when he's not using them. The game <em>attempts</em> to make it more realistic in the cut scenes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutScenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutScenePowerToTheMax">untraditionally so</a>), where Max is shown tugging around a huge black bag roughly since the time he acquires the "heavy duty persuaders" like the M16 and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Sniper Rifle</a>. The third game averts this by only allowing him to carry two pistols and one rifle at a time, and he has to drop the rifle if he wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">use the two pistols at the same time</a>.
</li><li> There is a noteworthy scene in <em>Mean Streets</em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TexMurphy">Tex Murphy</a>, who had been carrying a large, ornate <em>birdcage</em> in his pocket, pulls it out. In one of the cutscenes in <em>Pandora Directive</em>, Tex pulls a ten-foot pole out of his trenchcoat, very slowly and deliberately.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercenariesPlaygroundOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercenariesPlaygroundOfDestruction">Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</a></em>, you can only carry two weapons and grenades, and the weapons are always visible, though you still carry an improbable amount of ammunition. Not to mention the various smoke grenades, radio beacons, laser designators, satellite uplinks, and multifarious support items you can carry. In the sequel, your character picks up briefcases full of money and <em>car gas tanks</em>, both of which just magically transport themselves into your stockpile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> starts its main character out carrying nothing but a pack of cigarettes... but Solid Snake quickly winds up carrying a pistol, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, two rocket launchers, a metal detector, a cache of Claymore mines, enough rations for a week's march, and three cardboard boxes big enough to hide under.
</li><li> Raiden of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> has similarly large amounts of equipment. By the end of the game he has two pistols, four rifles, two rocket launchers, a revolver grenade launcher, multiple frag and stun grenades, caches of both Claymores and C4, a high-frequency blade, Snake's pack of cigarettes, coolant spray, multiple rations, <em>five</em> boxes big enough to hide under, body armor, an enemy uniform, two pairs of enhanced-vision goggles, multiple bandages and Pentazemin pills, multiple magazines (of both empty "gun" and "pornographic" varieties), binoculars, a camera, four different anti-personnel or explosive sensors, and a cell phone. Adding on to that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> is about 361 pairs of stolen enemy dog tags. All that is ever physically on his person are one of the pistols, the high-frequency blade, and his own dog tags after a specific point late in the game, alongside the uniform, body armor, or one of the unlockable wigs if they're equipped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> adds, besides an armory's worth of firepower: caged animals (which can be as large as a Giant Anaconda), medical supplies, changes of camouflage clothes, and a collection of dead carcasses up to the size of an alligator or mountain goat. The series concept artist once had a shot at drawing the hero <em>wearing</em> his equipment, but forgot about the boxes.
<ul><li> The game does provide a backpack inventory system; the player can equip a limited number of weapons and items that can be accessed without going to the pause menu, with everything else stored in the backpack. The items themselves each have a set weight, and the amount of items equipped affects Snake's stamina drain; the backpack items apparently lose their weight when not equipped. In addition, the only items Snake is seen holding is whatever you have selected as his active items. And this doesn't even include the medical items, which are inventoried under the "Cure" option in the pause menu, and which Snake keeps on him even when he doesn't have his backpack. The pack itself would not be able in real life to carry everything Snake accumulates, but it could manage the few items he starts the game with.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, Snake gains the Metal Gear Mk 2, a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot">robot</a> the size of a small cat that holds his extra inventory, including automatically selling any spare weapons he picks up to Drebin. However, it still doesn't explain Snake carrying two assault rifles, a pistol, an anti-materiel rifle, a drum can, various bits of random inventory pieces (camera, the aforementioned cigarettes, syringes, etc.), and a twenty-kilo railgun capable of destroying APCs in one hit. At least. The only thing he keeps visibly on him is his knife, in a back holster, and a handgun in a hip holster.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>, where the canonical explanation is that all of the items Samus acquires are converted between mass and energy as needed thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Chozo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarksThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarksThirdLaw">technology</a> of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Power Suit</a> interfacing with Samus's willpower (hence why she can make the suit disappear and reappear on her body, or why the suit can begin fading away on its own during times of extreme emotional upheaval). The first two games of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em> attempt to make this more explicit by depicted missiles and bombs as outright energy charges without the conversion to physical objects, though this is dispensed with for the missiles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> to make the concept of Ice Missiles more intuitive. Played straight with the Energy Cells from the same game, which are bulky physical objects with no means of mass-to-energy conversion, being Galactic Federation rather than Chozo technology. <br/><br/>The Zero Suit in turn seems to have its own method of mass/energy storage as a sort of failsafe, given that Samus retains all of her upgrades after being stripped of her Power Suit toward the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em> but is unable to utilize any of them save her Energy Tanks until she manages to acquire a second Power Suit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VI</em> and successors, you have a finite but large inventory - enough for, say, four suits of plate armour, or twelve or more spears, or about fifty potions. None of this space is occupied by food, gold or ammunition (arrows and crossbow bolts don't exist as items in the game, but the weapon's efficacy is unhindered). Dead party members are not only still ambulatory but retain their full inventory capacity, even if reduced to their component molecules (<em>eradicated</em>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, the volume of material that can be carried around is about the size of a decent swimming pool (50 x 20 x 2 meters and more than 300 cubic meters to spare). If the player has an inventory filled with blocks (36 stacks of 64) then assuming the cubes are 1 cubit meter, Steve is carrying 2,304 cubic meters of materials. The game does however limit you to carrying 36 slots of items, and items stack in different quantities. Most items stack in units of 64, but some, such as snowballs, only carry in stacks of sixteen. This can lead to weird scenarios where you can't pick up a single piece of coal, because your inventory is full of string.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em>
<ul><li> Guybrush Threepwood stuffs the various items he finds in his <em>pants</em>. This is simultaneously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> by explaining that Guybrush's pants are "baggy fit". The ridiculousness of this is acknowledged when he pulls a twelve-foot ladder out of his pocket. Not a euphemism, ladies.
</li><li> In one memorable scene during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em>, Guybrush picks up a dog, stuffs it into his coat, and smiles at the screen. Not to mention that he can pick up a petrified monkey too, and hold BOTH in his pockets at the same time. There is also a scene where Guybrush goes diving to recover the figurehead from a sunken ship. After struggling to move the obviously extremely heavy thing for a few moments, he puts it under his coat, and then has no trouble moving around with it.
</li><li> The more cartoony feel of the third game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCurseOfMonkeyIsland">The Curse of Monkey Island</a></em>, enables the animators to make a joke out of this, having him shooting a knowing glance at the camera as he pulls a bargepole out of his pocket, or animating him holding out the waistband, dropping the item in and his trouser leg billowing. Joked with when he gets a bottomless cup, which literally has no bottom. The lemonade simply falls through it.
</li><li> Two scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em> play with this:
<ul><li> Guybrush is tied to a heavy weight to hold him underwater until he drowns. He escapes by simply picking the weight up and putting it in his inventory, whereupon it ceases to weigh him down.
</li><li> When incarcerated by the cannibals, Guybrush can fit a banana picker as long as he is tall in his pants with nary a bulge, but can't escape with it through a hole in the floor because it's too large.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>: You have a limited amount of spaces in your inventory, but even on the most basic level, you can hold <em>dozens</em> of swords, spears, crossbows, bows, food, books, clothing, armor, <em>even dozens of horses</em> in your inventory. The inventory is somewhat symbolic. You use the horses as pack animals to increase your speed on the world map (while item weight decreases it). If you look behind you right after starting a battle, you'll see a small cart which you can use to swap your equipped items if needed. Those extra horses aren't visible though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyTimeAtPortia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyTimeAtPortia">My Time at Portia</a></em>: you will probably be regularly carrying a sword, lumber axe, mining pick, and fishing rod, none of which appear on your model until actively equipped. Besides that, you can also carry up to 999 units of any item in one inventory slot, which can be of any size from plant seeds to raw timber to smelting furnaces bigger than you are. While you're limited to eight active inventory slots at a time, you can eventually increase your inventory to a ridiculous amount of space, probably enough to put the entire town of Portia into your pockets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em>: In <em>The Ghost of Thornton Hall</em>, Nancy literally carries around a <em>cotton picker</em>. Plus about 12 oranges. In other games she usually juggles at least two or three keys and other various small items. She's also been known to lug around completely full mouse traps, dozens of glass eyes, firewood, metal slugs, and bags full of food and/or candy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack">Nethack</a></em>, the player's inventory is limited both by number of items (52, although items such as same-color potions or gems can stack) and net weight of all the items. Increasing the strength stat allows the player to carry heavier loads, while tools such as sacks can be used to increase numerical capacity. There are in particular Bags of Holding, which reduce the weight of items stored therein.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> uses a grid system to "limit" what you can carry. Never mind that you have room for at least a dozen sets of full plate armor. There are also magical bags (and their more powerful cousins, bags of holding) which reduce or eliminate the weight of items along with making them take up only as much space as the bag itself. The weight limit for strong characters can easily be a couple hundred pounds (prior to any magic items which boost strength), without limiting movement speed or ability to fight; it can be much, much more if one is willing to walk at a speed of a foot a minute. Of course, aside from clothing and worn armor, no equipment is visible on the character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">The sequel</a> doesn't bother trying to limit it this way and allows you to carry 140-some-odd items regardless of size, only limiting by weight.
</li><li> Ryu Hayabusa in the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em> carries an arsenal in a skintight, pocket-less leather outfit that would be humourously over-the-top were he not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">murderous out-for-revenge</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a>. It includes four different katana, two different types of nunchaku, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">a warhammer</a>, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>, a large wooden oar, a spear gun and a variety of other items.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, Ammy can carry bags of feed, damaging items, jugs of sake, technique scrolls, and all of her weapons despite being a wolf with no pockets. Then again, she <em>is</em> a Goddess, so magic is most likely involved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni">Oni</a></em>, an earlier game from the creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, only allows you to carry one weapon at a time, as well as a limited number of ammo clips and health recovery items. The game was focused on martial arts, so this limit kept the focus off shooting. The main character can still make her weapon disappear by holstering it, though, and even the moderate supply limit is invisible on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexSpaceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexSpaceSuit">Latex Space Suit</a> uniform.
</li><li> Everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> carries infinite ammo for their weapons. Special mention given to Reaper, who has an endless supply of loaded twin shotguns in his longcoat, in which said shotguns are thrown away whenever he ran out of ammo; and Junkrat, who has an endless supply of the tire thing on his back that he uses for his ultimate.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em> hero holds five large weapons, yet is never seen with anything but the shotgun on his person in cutscenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em> has limited inventory but provides storage boxes. Unlike the storage boxes of many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> games, these are not interconnected. Similarly, the game annoyingly considers a key to be the same size as a handgun. And the game has a lot of keys. This makes <em>a keyring</em> one of the most important items in the game, because it allows you to store many of them on one square.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has the robbers carry 3 guns, which range from handguns, rifles/shotguns/light machine guns, and a secondary shotgun or sub machine gun. There's no visible straps on the characters and the size of the bulkier weapons would realistically be impossible to hide in the inside of a suit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">The sequel</a> tries to be a bit more realistic by limiting people to two guns, and the expanded amount of weapon mods make it possible to make most guns smaller and more concealable, not to mention each weapon has different amounts of visibility, which determines how fast civilians and guards notice you during stealth. For both games, before a heist goes loud, you can look inside a player character's model and see that their gun is actually floating inside their bodies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar">Phantasy Star</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Phantasy Star</em> shows this trope, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse">Phantasy Star Universe</a></em>. The latter however explains it with 'nanotranser' technology, a sort of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke's Third Law<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Bag of Holding that's worn somewhere on a character's body, and projects stored objects into realspace as needed. Not only is this trope played with a bit in the game's Offline Story Mode, when Tonnio steals the protagonist Ethan Waber's nanotranser, and thus his weapons, money... and clothes, but the hyperspace arsenal was also the climax of the first story arc. The enemy at large was dealt with by shoving it into a Hammerspace induced by a giant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> nanotranser called the Confinement System.
</li><li> <em>Phantasy Star IV</em>: In addition to the usual items and old weapons, the party casually carries around two tanks and a hydrofoil, each of which can comfortably fit the entire party in its cockpit. One can only <em>assume</em> hyperspace technology is involved, since the game itself offers no explanation as to why each vehicle inhabits the same amount of space as, say, a chocolate bar.
</li><li> <em>Universe</em> puts them to good use in one mission, where Ethan helps a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Lou</a> rescue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">another Lou</a> who was injured. Rather than physically carry her double all the way back through a hostile area, Lou simply puts her into her nanotranser.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em>Pitfall: The Lost Expedition</em> when Pitfall Harry picked up a hang glider then commented in surprise on how it fit into his backpack, adding "Let's not question it."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePerilsOfAkumos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePerilsOfAkumos">The Perils of Akumos</a></em>: The narration breaks the fourth wall when you pick up a large potted plant, dismissing your ability to carry it as inherent to adventure games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> is another ridiculous example, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em>, where the item cap was changed from 99 to 999, along with item storage on the computer. By the end of the game you're carrying a Coin Case, a Fashion Case, an Explorer Kit, a bunch of keys, a bicycle (which would be too large unless it were a folding bike as stated in Red/Blue), various notepads, a Poffin Case, a Seal Case, a Secret Potion, a Town Map, and a Vs. Seeker, all in the Key Items pocket of the backpack. Add on top of that, the various medicines for your Pokémon, as well as the Poké Balls, CD-shaped TMs and HMs, Berries, Mail, and the Pokédex and Pokétch that you carry outside of the bag! The player character sure knows how to pack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal">Postal</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Postal 2</em> is a particularly big offender: not only will The Postal Dude be carrying multiple melee weapons, a pistol, a shotgun, an automatic rifle, grenades, gasoline cans, a hunting rifle, and two types of launchers all at once, but he's also got another inventory for carrying other goods, like cash, milk, lunch bags, crack pipes, books, and cats. <em>Multiple cats.</em> Naturally, he doesn't seem burdened by it one bit. This gets particularly ridiculous if you die in-game, as any character who dies drops all of their weapons and inventory items; where NPCs only ever drop at most two of each, the death of the Postal Dude will be proceeded by a veritable cascade of guns, food, money, and other assorted clutter exploding out of his still-falling corpse, bouncing off of each other and covering the better part of a ten-foot radius around wherever he falls. His inventory only expands with patches and the DLC added after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> release; as of <em>Paradise Lost</em> he can have upwards of 20 melee weapons, three pistols, <em>four</em> shotguns, two automatics, five types of grenades, a full gas can and two or three different weapons that run on it, three or four launchers, and assorted other unique weapons on top of that.
</li><li> The add-on <em>Apocalypse Weekend</em> pokes fun at this (while taking it to huge extremes) by having him acquire a <em>nuclear warhead bigger than himself</em> and stuffing it within his trenchcoat. When he gets to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bullfish Interactive headquarters</span>, he grunts with effort from pulling the warhead out of his coat and setting it down with an earth-rattling THOOOM.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rage">Rage</a></em>, in the tradition of id Software games, embraces this trope.

And that's just the weapons. You're also likely be carrying a load of quick use items, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> components, and a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>. Unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>, there's no restrictions on how much junk you can carry.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> series, the eponymous Ratchet is a small, furry, semi-feline alien who seems to be able to carry more than two dozen weapons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">some much larger than himself</a>! When walking around unarmed, these weapons are completely invisible, and seem to just fold out into his arms when needed. A lampshade is hung on this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em>, in the death course/death arena show "Annihilation Nation", when the announcer asks the all-important question, "Where's he keepin' all these guns? I mean, come on!"
<ul><li> The movie that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)</a></em> is based on explains it with telequipping, which teleports a weapon or gadget from the Hall of Heroes into your hands whilst wearing a Galactic Ranger Protosuit, and both works share the same visuals for this feature. In the game this is actually a plot hole, because Ratchet can telequip before being inducted into the Rangers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">but given that Captain Qwark is telling the story</a>...). Previous games mentioned that he kept his guns in a Hyperspace Ring that stores them when he's not using them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series's take on this is relatively realistic: each item has to fit in a grid of space inside a backpack, suitcase, or whatnot. That said container (up to an "attaché case" large enough to contain the hero himself) is never actually visible is an exercise for the interested reader. Still, characters often find a way of stuffing a rocket launcher or an M4A1 assault rifle inside their pockets.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>, Jill Valentine is wearing a tube top and miniskirt (and later does get an equipment harness), but manages to carry much more than the temporarily playable Carlos, who's wearing combat gear with plenty of pockets, and is demonstrably stronger than her (he can shove objects that she can't).
</li><li> The Merchant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> is a huge example of this. He has, at one point, several handguns, three shotguns, two rifles, the minethrower, the TMP, all of the attache cases, the RPG, the Chicago Typewriter, the Infinite RPG, and a multitude of consumable items.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> takes this trope and creates a bizarre sub-branch. Any weapons larger than a handgun are visible on your body when they aren't equipped (i.e. if you're running around with an unequipped rocket launcher, you can see it attached to the character's back, though how it stays magically stuck there without any visible straps is anyone's guess). However, if you have more than two weapons in your inventory, one of them will disappear into thin air when you switch weapons, depending on what order you switch.
<ul><li> Moreover, since the fifth game's inventory system features nine grid slots that each carry one type of item (rather than different items taking up different amounts of grid space <em>a la Resident Evil 4</em>), carrying nine Green Herbs somehow ends up being just as strenuous to the player characters as lugging around nine rocket launchers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Exception: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad">Rise of the Triad</a></em>, you can carry just two pistols, a machine gun and a single "heavy weapon" (usually a rocket launcher). That still leaves the question of where the player character manages to store ten rockets and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">infinite supply of bullets</a> while wearing a T-shirt and black uniform trousers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobotechBattlecry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobotechBattlecry">Robotech: Battlecry</a></em> uses this trope just like Ace Combat above. The game attempts to justify this by claiming that the missile racks are reloaded from internal stores. An infinite number of missile reloads.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em>, one of each class of stowed weapon (big sword on back, small sword on leg, axe on other leg, etc...) is always visible. However, the player can carry about 3 of each class simultaneously, and the really humongous weapons shrink when stowed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>, each player has a 28-space inventory. However, even some of the largest items only take up one space. This means that it's possible to, among many other things, carry <em>28 cooked sharks</em> with you at a time!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> you can only carry one weapon of each <em>category</em> at a time unless dual-wielding pistols or machine pistols (in which case they have to be of the same model), but that still theoretically allows for multiple long guns. Still less unrealistic than how nobody gives a hoot when he's visibly carrying around weapons (unless he points it at them), or how rivals (such as the Ronin) can be strolling down the sidewalk with <em>katanas</em> over their shoulders.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> the Boss now pulls weapons of of the front of their pants, regardless of size and pointiness.

Feasible. But Max wears no clothing at all, and not only carries a gun, but in <em>The Devil's Playhouse</em>, he carries multiple toys of power. When various villains take Sam's items, they're unable to take Max's (except in one case, where Max was actively using the item taken when captured), as they don't know where Max keeps them. And in <em>Reality 2.0</em>, during a "text adventure" sequence, Sam is surprised when he's able to carry an entire (unseen) <em>building</em>. This is finally explained at the end of season three, when Sam goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot">inside Max's body</a> and can explore his legs, arms, brain, stomach ... and <em>inventory,</em> which on Max is apparently an unspecified bodily orifice. Max is still carrying items from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a></em> in there.

<ul><li> Tony Montana can only hold three weapons, four if upgraded, and only one of each "type" (pistols, SMGs, assault rifles). However, they are nowhere to be seen on his business-attired person. Furthermore, the "restriction" doesn't prevent him from carrying a missile launcher, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squad_automatic_weapon">SAW<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, shotgun and sniper rifle, along with the attendant ammo. Add to that the fact that Tony can swap his arsenal from outfit to outfit.
</li><li> Somewhat more amusingly used with leaders of enemy gangs, who cough up on death a large box of cash they could not possibly have fit into their clothing.
</li><li> Similarly, the arms street dealers somehow pack an inventory limited only by Tony's considerable finances.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scratches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scratches">Scratches</a></em>, at one point the player free-rappels out an upstairs window and climbs into a lower one while carrying a magnifying glass, four keys, a large knife, a kerosene lantern, a grinding tool, a stethoscope, a newspaper, an oilcan, and a hammer — in a driving rain (which has served as a sort of meteorological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">Insurmountable Waist-Height Fence</a>, keeping him inside the house).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em> has a ring menu which allows you to carry a limited number of infinite-use items and/or consumables (up to 9 of a single type of consumable), but outside of battle you have access an almost bottomless inventory of everything you've picked up (i.e., that inventory holds a maximum of 99 of everything).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> has the eponymous main character toting around an impossible arsenal that includes things like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">minigun that's longer than he is tall</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">only slightly smaller chainsaw</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">ridiculously huge cannon</a>, unaffected by their weight. For comical effect, the weapon switch animations (when using the 3rd person view) show the character tucking all of these in the back pocket of his jeans. However, there is a part during <em>The First Encounter</em> where you keep your weapons but have to <em>drop all the ammo</em> except for shotgun shells, because you traveled through the desert for a few days. Somewhat strange, considering the above fact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> series is guilty of this (though given the ambiguous nature of the town, it's not sure if the characters are lugging around actual items or merely the psychic manifestations of them):
<ul><li> An especially ridiculous example is a "Great Knife" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, which is huge and extremely heavy and hard to use... but you can still stuff it into your clothes, at which point it seems to lose all weight.
</li><li> Travis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins">Silent Hill: 0rigins</a></em> deserves a special mention as he manages to stuff up to 20 portable TVs in his jacket. Also: enough bottles of alcohol to start a distillery; more sledgehammers than Triple-H's closet; more tire irons and wrenches than a hardware store; and a couple of katanas to make every aspiring Samurai or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a> happy. All. At. Once.
</li><li> They tried to avert it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4">Silent Hill 4</a></em>. The inventory is limited — however, you now have the hyperspace box in your apartment. Further, you are limited to slots, not space. So a pickaxe takes up the same amount of space on your person as some coins.
</li><li> While the player character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> (and thus doesn't carry weapons), the inventory still consists of an astonishing number of flares and mementos.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>: The titular Sims pull <em>everything</em> out of their pockets(even when they're wearing swimsuits). While weapons aren't involved, it deserves mentioning here due to the sheer variety of impossible things Sims can carry in their pockets, including a whole crop of vegetables, cars and helicopters. A pirate shipwreck? Why not?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> has a few playable characters who have a large amount of weapons carried on their person but otherwise don't appear to be armed. Peacock is justified, as she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> and is actually conjuring the items and beings in-battle. There is no explanation for Big Band, however, despite there being at least several dozen weapons underneath that trenchcoat, all of which he can equip instantly and some of which are even larger than he is.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>: Tails, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsAdventure">Tails Adventure</a></em>, where he has bombs, a hammer, remote controlled bombs, a remote controlled robot, even bigger bombs, and a helmet as big as he is that he can just pull out of nowhere, among other things. Even in other games, Tails has a tendency to pull tools and a handheld computer as large as his head out of absolutely nowhere.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpaceBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpaceBar">The Space Bar</a></em>. The main character has a futuristic PDA which can dematerialize and digitize objects into its internal storage and then rematerialize them as needed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> series of adventure games makes fun of this trope more than once.
<ul><li> In <em>Space Quest 2</em> upon picking up a wastebasket the narrator responds "Aren't you amazed by how much stuff an adventure game hero can carry? You've just got to know how to pack."
</li><li> In <em>Space Quest 3</em>, Roger must stuff a ladder as long as himself into his pants. The narrator comments on how much empty space he must have down there.
</li><li> In <em>Space Quest 6</em>, hero Roger Wilco picks up a large 2x4 board, and the game's narrator says, "Bet you can't fit that in your pants!" Roger <em>does</em>, and the narrator is genuinely surprised.

Regrettably averted in the remake, which conforms to the now-standard two-gun setup.

<ul><li> Earlier games had Agent Logan carry multiple pistols, shotguns, submachineguns, assault rifles (yes, they're all plural), a sniper rifle, a taser, a flashlight, explosives, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> all in his pants. Literally—in the first game, an animation shows Logan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrouserSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrouserSpace">reaching into and picking the item from his pocket</a>, producing anything from a plausible 9mm to an absolutely absurd sniper rifle (the animation was removed in <em>Syphon Filter 2</em> and later in favor of an <em>instantaneous</em> switch of weapons).
</li><li> The later games averted the trope. You're only allowed to carry one type of weapon per "hardpoint", and unused weapons are clearly shown being worn by the agent on his back. However, it's still not clear where Logan is able to carry five spare magazines for each projectile weapon he's carrying.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal">Tales of Maj'Eyal</a></em> you gain, early on, access to the Transmorgification Chest, which automatically stores infinite items, renders them weightless, and automatically sells them whenever you change zones or floors of a dungeon. The catch is that you can't use any of the items in the chest; you can transfer them to to your normal inventory, and then deal with weight restrictions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, when the characters receive a boat they shrink it into a little box so they can conveniently carry it around. One might think this must be the way they are carrying all of their considerable arsenal of items, but most of the characters are surprised to learn about the shrinking boat in a box.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em> the main character Ark has a literal hyperspace arsenal he can walk around in. This is actually somewhat annoying, as traditional equipment screen are much faster and easier to navigate. He only walks around in specific plot points. For most of the game, it's a traditional inventory navigation scheme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech">TerraTech</a></em> has a fairly literal example, with loose blocks being sucked into the player's inventory by a "Singularity Containment Device". The player can store tens of thousands of blocks without any consequence and pull one out at any time, or even deploy an entire tech.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> franchise both averts and plays the trope straight:
<ul><li> This trope (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a>) was referenced by the developers as something they wanted to avoid in the original trilogy, via having Garrett lose most of his consumable items (including bombs, arrows and potions) between levels.
</li><li> That said, Garrett can apparently carry his tools, weapons, ammunition and all the wealth of a richly appointed mansion or an <em>entire freaking museum</em> inside his cloak, since he's never depicted with any bags. Presumably Keeper training includes instructions on how to access an inter-dimensional pocket. One mission even has him carrying around a <em>gramophone</em>, and another four stone tablets the size of his head!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief2014">Thief</a></em>, Garrett can carry all of the following on him at once: a dagger, his bow, several types of arrows, flash bombs, key items and several implements (including a wrench, prybar, wirecutter and razor) on him at all times, though none of this is seen in cutscenes. Likewise, he can also continue to sneak around while carrying several hundred wine glasses and enough cutlery to open a restaurant.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba">Tomba!</a></em> series. Tomba, the main character, is a pink haired caveboy wearing nothing more than a grass skirt. Early on, he reveals to an NPC that he keeps everything in the inventory <em>in his stomach</em> and vomits it up as necessary. Yes, even living livestock needed for sidequests, as demonstrated when he rescues some baby chicks, swallows them, and throws them up later — alive and perfectly fine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">A lampshade is hung</a> by the same NPC he reveals it to, who asks what <em>else</em> he keeps in there, only to add, "No, don't tell me..."
</li><li> Lara Croft from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> has her infamous tiny backpack. Her twin pistols rest in holsters, and in later games she wears one long gun on her back, but switching weapons makes it magically swap to a different one. (A cynical observer may remark that the backpack exists to counterbalance her implausibly giant chest.)
</li><li> The backpack is also played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></em> movie. In the TR games, if Lara puts an object close to her backpack, it magically teleports into it. If she needs something from it, she puts her hand close, and voila! In the movies, she is never actually shown to put <em>anything</em> in her backpack; instead, she simply puts it close, the camera cuts away to another scene, and no one mentions it again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalDistortion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalDistortion">Total Distortion</a></em>, the player character carries a guitar case which functions as an interdimensional portal to their own personal dimension. This guitar-case dimension's only purpose is to provide you with storage space for indeterminate amounts of items that you can find or make in your kitchen. In-universe, this is the primary use for the alternate dimensions - to <em>greatly</em> expedite shipping by teleporting items into another dimension and then teleport them back out at the point of delivery. The only limitation is that the larger the object, the more energy it takes to transport it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> Thanks to her mastery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">boundaries</a>, including dimensional ones, Yukari Yakumo has this as an explicit power - she just opens a gate to wherever what she needs is stored and grabs it. Thanks to this, she's been seen making use of such weapons as falling tombstones, flying signposts, and even a <em>train</em>.
</li><li> Sakuya has an effectively infinite supply of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">knives</a> due to her manipulation of space-time, both literally pulling them from a hyperspace storage place and the knives returning to said storage after they're used. In game this manifests as the player being on the receiving end of <em>a solid wall of knives</em>.
</li><li> This also applies to anyone that uses a non-magical gimmick, such as Reimu and Sanae's exorcism seals, Alice's dolls, and Komachi's coins.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTrailOfAnguish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTrailOfAnguish">The Trail Of Anguish</a></em> as well, where you question your ability to carry your many items on a formal dinner. Your date, as it turns out, has a hyperspace arsenal or his own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a> 2</em>: Turok carries 23 different weapons with him: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun">Flare Gun</a>, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">Talon and the War Blade</a>, two bows, two pistols (regular and bulky burst-mode versions), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantSedation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantSedation">tranquilizer gun</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticStunGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticStunGun">tazer dart rifle</a>, two shotguns (a regular one and the bulkier Shredder), a plasma-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Sniper Rifle</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Firestorm Cannon</a>, the Cerebral Bore, six bulky flashbang grenades, a gun that shoots proximity mines, a grenade launcher, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon">flamethrower</a>, a serrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleBoomerang">Battle Boomerang</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoonGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoonGun">Harpoon Gun</a>, a tri-shot rocket launcher, a torpedo launcher (it doubles as an underwater jet, and is very bulky), and, finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNukeEm">a Nuke</a>. Not to mention ammo and some artifacts you carried on occasion. Granted this is all carried in his Light Burden, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em> has your character carrying an arsenal of bulky, unwieldy weapons, then, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessProtagonist">(s)he</a> dies, the camera pulls back to see that not only is (s)he not visibly carrying anything, his/her clothes are skimpy and skin-tight to the point that (s)he couldn't be concealing so much as a pocketknife.
</li><li> Partly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVampyreStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AVampyreStory">A Vampyre Story</a></em>. If it's small enough that it could logically be placed in a purse or small satchel, Mona will take it with her, regardless of the danger of spilling, anything else she's carrying, or even the fact that she doesn't actually have a purse or small satchel. Anything that's too large or cumbersome (or that involve Froderick interacting with something else), she leaves where it is, but says she'll make a note of it and gains a ghostly blue icon of the item or combination. When the icon is used with it's requisite puzzle, it first shows Mona retrieving the item in question.
</li><li> Interestingly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish">Vanquish</a></em>. You have the new prototype BLADE (Battlefield Logic ADaptable Electronic) weapon, an expandable carbon nanotube device which can re-arrange itself into any weapon stored in its memory, including weapons bigger than your torso. The catch is, the data needed to make up a whole gun-sized object, down to the molecular level, is so much that the gun's hard drive can only store three configurations at a time. These can be swapped by scanning different guns, which also provide more ammo.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VegaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VegaStrike">Vega Strike</a></em>. Whatever you can physically fit that million-ton mining equipment in your ship's hold, you can transport—but this will impair maneuverability, unless your ship already was several times more massive. It's very noticeable on the starting ship — Llama is a light shuttle supposed to carry things like gases and food, so while it's pretty agile when empty, grabbing all available metals and stones off a mining base may take about 2/3 of the hold, but raise mass beyond 3700% of norm, making it almost impossible to dock with anything smaller than a planet. All ammo in gun mounts and missile bays is counted by volume, too — and some milspec ships can pack more than a basic version. Still, hardpoints for weapons as such are not measured even when internal, and it sometimes is hard to see how all the equipment you've outfitted your fighter with fits in there. It's no wonder to have 10,000 Ion Burster ammo per slot when they're 5 grams each, but with mass drivers...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Vietcong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Vietcong">Vietcong</a></em> averts this trope and plays it straight at the same time. The main hero, Steve Hawkins, can carry one primary weapon (rifle, submachine gun, grenade launcher ...), one pistol, one combat knife, four grenades, one medkit, a few flares, a flashlight and several magazines for each ammunition type (the fact that several weapons use the same ammunition definitely helps here) ... and that's it. On the other hand, the team's engineer can carry what seems an infinite load of ammo (and in an interesting twist, he only carries ammunition for American weapons - you have to loot killed enemies if you want to pick up and use that PPS-41 Russian submachine gun), and the medic's supply of medkits seems infinite as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> Lee is shown stuffing a car battery down the pack of his pants. There's no protrusion, nor does the 40 odd pounds of weight slow him down in the slightest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhawk">Warhawk</a></em> you can carry an entire arsenal including a machine gun, missile launcher, sniper rifle, binoculars, two types of land mines, a knife, a wrench, a flame thrower, a pistol, grenades, and ammo for everything. Additionally, if a player is killed they drop it all in a huge backpack about as big as a person which can be absorbed by anyone who gets near it.
</li><li> The RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland">Wasteland</a></em> limited each party member to 30 slots. An apple was the same as a (variably-sized) box of 7.62mm ammo, a rake, a chainsaw, an assault rifle, and a meson cannon. One popular trick is to load your party down at generation with 30 pistols each, then drag yourselves to the nearest gun shop and get rifles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>, the player can hold 1 silver sword 2 iron swords/axes/maces/big weapon and a dagger/smallflail/torch, fair enough, as the protagonist is a Witcher who is meant to be inhumanly strong (and real weapons don't weigh as much as fiction makes them out to). The rest of the inventory gets confuseing though, as you can hold the brains of 50 of the roughly human sized Drowner monsters or 1-50 teath in a single slot of your alchemy pouch, same for 10 bottles of alcohol or a small gemstone in the main inventory. (Note:The game does not have a weight system on top of it) In Witcher 3, however, player gets a horse which always roams nearby if not rided and carries saddlebags of limited capacity. Fair enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein">Wolfenstein</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>: By the end of this game if you collect everything you have a grand total of twelve guns, a rocket launcher, a flamethrower, a Tesla gun and two types of grenades plus all your ammunition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009">Wolfenstein</a></em> continues the tradition. By the end of the game, you'll be carry three real-life guns, a rocket launcher, a flamethrower, a Tesla Gun, a particle cannon, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay">Disintegrator Ray</a>.

Oh, and all that armor made from scraps you shoot off your enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfTeam">Wolf Team</a></em> plays this one in spades. While you can only carry a big gun, a pistol, and some nades, your encumberence is affected by the really big weapons, such as the portable mounted machine guns, which are the size of three men and have to be deployed to fire. However, if you switch to yout pistol or knife, the giant gun goes away and you can now walk or run at full speed. Oftentimes you will see hordes of players running with knives during the beginning of Capture the Flag mode just to run faster.

They can also find or buy up to four 'pouches' of sizes ranging from 4 to 30 items (or 36 for specialty bags). Items always take up only one slot, and for most unequippable items each slot can hold several of the same type at once for possibly ridiculous results. You never have trouble fitting them into the mouth of the bag. Money, toys, companion pets, and mounts are also stored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">outside your bags</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM: UFO Defense</a></em> uses a grid inventory in which each unit has a certain number of cells, in different shapes, on his belt, limbs, in his hands, and in his backpack. However, the backpack and items carried are never actually shown, except for the gun they hold. It still qualifies as this trope as most player-controlled units are perfectly capable of stowing a human body (unconscious or dead) or most alien corpses. In both cases, the mass is not visible, though it has a seriously detrimental effect on how quickly the unit can move per turn.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> series most of the weapons in the games, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mecha</a> in the third installment, are in fact pulled from a literal hyperspace arsenal, with visual effects showing them "warping in" when a character needs to use them. Jr. and Jin, however, prefer to carry their weapons the old-fashioned way. Jr. has, at least in the third game, a pair of holsters and Jin carries the sheath strapped to his waist. In the first game, KOS-MOS pulls the gun out of the pouch on her right leg.
</li><li> Somewhat justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZanZarahTheHiddenPortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZanZarahTheHiddenPortal">ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal</a></em> as the fairy bag Amy receives upon arrival to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">Magical Land</a> is flat-out given a description of "an extremely useful invention that can hold an almost unlimited ammount of items without changing its weight or size".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZorkGrandInquisitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZorkGrandInquisitor">Zork: Grand Inquisitor</a></em> when the player puts a large vacuum on a vending machine and Delboz comments "Just where were you keeping that?"
</li><li> Players in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom">Ryzom</a></em> have an inventory that limits them to 999 of most raw materials, EXP catalysts, and ammunition, as well as a "bulk" meter that caps at 300 (and a weight system that penalizes you if you carry too much, though this is only really a problem for gunners). However, you can still carry a <em>lot</em> of things in there, such as a whole other set of armor, a full set of jewelry, and a few weapons, a few of which can be at least 8 feet long.

</li><li> By the end of either game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fairune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fairune">Fairune</a></em> series, you'll be carrying around at least two useless tools, a bottle, a large, talking book and a fragment of magic and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a lifesize statue of yourself!

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em> test of the trope occurred during their "Video Game Special" and involved an FPS-style combat course modeled after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>. Adam and Jamie ran the course once discarding each weapon as they picked up a new one, then did it again keeping each new piece of equipment as they found it until they were carrying an 80-pound load. Both struggled visibly during the second run, taking nearly twice as long to complete the course as they did the first time through. Professional MMA fighter Brendan Schaub, on the other hand, made it through the course just as fast with the full load as he did unencumbered - not only that, but in his enthusiasm he forgot to actually use the backpack to store any of the items he was carrying, and <em>still</em> finished the course faster encumbered than either Adam or Jamie managed in their control runs, leading to the "Plausible" verdict.

While characters have a weight limit based on Strength (and lose mobility if they go over this limit), that's the only concession to reality with regards to what someone can carry on their person. For example, any Fighter worth his salt would be lugging around a small armory's worth of weapons and ammunition in order to deal with creatures who only take damage under certain circumstances.
