</div></div><p>Like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishHumour">British</a>, Russians pride themselves on possessing a well-developed and all-encompassing sense of humour. Almost every print publication will have at least a few jokes in it, up to and including the TV guide. They say that while in most countries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">The Internet Is for Porn</a>, in Russia, The Internet Is for Jokes.

Typical of Russian joke culture is a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots and plays on words.
</p><p>Since the advent of the Internet (and especially Web 2.0), anecdotes' popularity is rivaled by that of <em>baikas</em> (<em>bajki</em>, "tales") - short to middle-sized (up to several paragraphs) funny stories that supposedly happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (though it's not uncommon and even encouraged for each narrator to slightly exaggerate facts and add fictional details for better effect). They enjoyed steady popularity throughout the Russian history, but only the Net made it easy to collect them in bulk.

It contains a simple rhyme scheme (ABAB, ABCB, or AABB) and can feature ideas of humor, irony, satire, love, or political propaganda, the latter especially featuring more prominently among peasants during the Communist regime. The content of the chastushki (plural), and the popularity of what topic was most prominently sung about, would vary from region to region.

<p></p><ul><li> Stirlitz. This is a character from the highly popular Soviet TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventeenMomentsOfSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventeenMomentsOfSpring">Seventeen Moments of Spring</a></em>. The series is about a Soviet spy, Maxim Isayev, who infiltrates Nazi Germany under the guise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Standartenführer</a> (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks">Common Ranks</a>) Otto von Stirlitz and foils its plans to enter into a separate peace treaty with the Western Allies. Stirlitz interacts with Nazi officials Walther Schellenberg, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Martin Bormann, and Heinrich Müller. In the jokes he interacts with them as well as with fictional female radio operator Kat, pastor Schlagg, professor Pleischner and other characters in the series. Most Stirlitz jokes are based on puns and wordgames. The series itself is dark and moody, similar to American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>, and has a solemn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">narrator</a>'s voice that narrates the inner dialogue of the characters. In the jokes, however, the stern voice tells hilarious puns instead of superlogical trains of thought. Here is a typical example:
<ul><li> Stirlitz had a thought. He liked it, so he had another.
</li><li> Supposedly, the first one in the class of wordgame-based jokes sounded like this: "Stirlitz shot Müller. The bullet bounced off. Bronevoy, thought Stirlitz", with the actor Leonid Bronevoy playing Müller in the series, and his last name meaning "armored one".
</li><li> Stirlitz heard someone knocking on his door. "Bormann", thought Stirlitz. "Me", thought Bormann.
</li><li> Stirlitz, walking down the corridor, subtly pushed the door of Bormann's office as he passed it. The door didn't budge. Stirlitz stopped, looked around and pushed harder. No effect. "Hmm... it must be closed", Stirlitz deduced.
<ul><li> Another variant of this joke involves some Fourth Wall painting:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Stirlitz, walking down the corridor, subtly pushed the door of Bormann's office. The door didn't move. Stirlitz stopped, looked around and pushed harder. To no effect.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Narrator's voiceover:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorDumb">''Pull'', you idiot!</a>
</div></li><li> <em>Seventeen Moments of Spring</em> was recently re-released in color. This led to a few new Stirlitz jokes, centered on colors. Here's one.
<ul><li> "Stirlitz was surprised to see so many colored people serving in the Gestapo".
</li><li> And so many blacks, at that!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p98i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0p98i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p98i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Physicists hate blacks...</a> as 'colours'. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Actual black is the absence of light, and so by definition cannot be a colour. So-called 'black' colours are, therefore, not actually black.</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> Stirlitz (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VyacheslavTikhonov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VyacheslavTikhonov">Vyacheslav Tikhonov</a> in the TV series) wakes up in a cell with no recollection of how he got there. "Who got me? Which name should I use?" - he wonders. - "Let's see. If they wear black (SS) uniforms, I'll say I'm Standartenführer Stirlitz. If they wear green (Red Army) uniforms, I'm Colonel Isayev". The door opens and a blue-uniformed NKVD policeman comes in saying: "You really should ease up on the vodka, Comrade Tikhonov!"
</li><li> Stirlitz opened a door. The lights went on. Stirlitz closed the door. The lights went out. Stirlitz opened the door again. The light went back on. Stirlitz closed the door. The light went out again. "It's a refrigerator," concluded Stirlitz.
</li><li> Muller was driving at 120 km/h. Stirlitz was running alongside him, trying to look unhurried.
</li><li> Of course, this being a spy flick, numerous jokes jab at the usual cliches.
<ul><li> Stirlitz heard someone knocking the door. He opened. There was a little dog. "What are you doing here, silly thing?" - he asked kindly. "You fool! I'm from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">Centre</a>." (This dog and Stirlitz's line were in the series. The dog didn't respond though.)
</li><li> Müller is awoken at 3 AM by knocking at his door. Annoyed as hell, he goes to open it and sees a bearded man in a winter jacket, an earflap-hat adorned with a Red Star, and laden with a huge radio set.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySpeak">Camels go east.</a>" - says the man.
</div><div class="indent">"Camels can go fuck themselves," - answers Müller in irritation - "Your man Stirlitz lives on the next floor."
</div><ul><li> Another joke references the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyObviousBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyObviousBug">backwards state of Soviet electronics</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent">Hitler walks into the war room and finds a massive, heavy-looking grey box dominating the table.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hitler</strong>: What is that?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Heinrich Müller</strong>: It's the latest Soviet audio bug. Now, <em>mein Führer</em>, only Stirlitz had access to this room; I told you he might be a spy...
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hitler</strong>: <em>*exasperated*</em> Never mind that, why hasn't anybody gotten rid of it?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Müller</strong>: We tried, <em>mein Führer</em>. Nobody can lift the damned thing.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev. He was a Red Army hero of the Russian Civil War, in the rank of Division Commander (roughly equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">Major General</a>), and was featured in a hugely popular 1934 biopic. Other characters from the biopic like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">aide-de-camp</a> Petka, Anka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">The Machine-Gunner</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">political commissar</a> Furmanov, all based on real people, are also featured in the jokes. Most common topics are about their fight with the White Army, Chapayev's futile attempts to enroll into the Frunze Military Academy, his folk-cunning and his incompetence in book military science, and the circumstances of his death; Officially and in the book, he was machine-gunned by the Whites while attempting to flee across the Ural River after a lost battle. It is said that Marshal Budyonny, upon hearing some of the jokes, said "I told him; unless you study, you'll be everyone's laughing stock".
<ul><li> "I flunked again, Petka. The question was about Caesar, and I told them it's a stallion from the 7th cavalry squadron." / "Oh, sorry about that, Vasily Ivanovich, I had him moved to the 6th!"
</li><li>
</li></ul><div class="indent"> - Vasiliy Ivanovich, an enemy tank's attacking!
</div><div class="indent"> - Take the grenade, Petka.
</div><div class="indent"> Some time later.
</div><div class="indent"> - Whew! We took it out!
</div><div class="indent">- Good. Now, put the grenade back, Petka.
</div><ul><li> One of many jokes playing on (and reinforcing) Chapayev's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> reputation:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>Chapayev and Petka are making a strategic retreat from the White Army, under heavy fire. Chapayev drops the satchel he's carrying, and has to run back and get it while bullets whiz all around him.</em> <br/><em>Once he catches back up, Petka shouts, "What's in the satchel, Vasily Ivanovich?"</em> <br/><em>"The campaign maps, Petka! I couldn't let them fall into the Whites' hands!"</em> <br/><em>They finally outrun the enemy and make it back to their own lines. Petka looks inside the satchel. "Hey, Vasily Ivanovich, there's only onions in here!"</em> <br/><em>Chapayev pours out all the onions onto a table. He piles the white onions at one end—"See, Petka, here are the Whites"—and the red onions at the other—"And here we are."</em>
</div><p></p><ul><li> One of the core jokes related to Chapayev's death, as mentioned above:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A Soviet elementary school teacher, in preparation for the celebration of the anniversary of the Revolution, asks the children whether any of their relatives knew anyone of the Bolshevik 'Old Guard' (of core members during the Civil War). Sashka<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g4bj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1g4bj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g4bj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> diminutive form of Alexander, something like "little Alex" </span> stands up and says that his grandfather knew Chapaev! The teacher is overjoyed and asks Sashka to ask his grandfather if he wants to come to the school and tell the children about Chapayev. The grandfather accepts and comes to class the next day.
<div class="indent"> -Comrade Petrov, your grandson says you knew our great hero Chapayev, who fought and died for the triumph of communism!
</div><div class="indent"> -Indeed, comrade teacher, I once saw the great revolutionary hero Vasily Ivany'ch.
</div><div class="indent"> -Oh, my! Please, would you tell the children when you saw him? What do you remember of him?
</div><div class="indent"> -Of course. Well, kids, I fought in the civil war. It was a fine morning in September, I remember it as if it were only yesterday... our platoon had had a long march and we were resting on the banks of a river. So I'm sitting there, eating an apple, my machine-gun in my lap. Then suddenly, I see movement - there's some guy swimming across the river. His Lordship the General, next to me, jumps up and shouts "<em>It's Chapayev!</em> Shoot, Ivan, Shoot!"

Reds, Greens, and Blacks had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">commanders, not officers</a>.)
</dd></dl><p></p></li><li> Lieutenant (Poruchik) Rzhevsky, a Hussar from the popular movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HussarBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HussarBallad">Hussar Ballad</a></em>. He is renowned for being a womanizer, telling lewd jokes and dropping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F Bombs</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">Sophisticated as Hell</a> manner. By some weird reason (maybe for sheer contrast), these jokes usually depict him interacting with characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a> such as Natasha Rostove or Pierre Bezukhov. The humor in these jokes comes from the futile attempts of this trash-talking, tit-grabbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> to pass as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman">Officer and a Gentleman</a> and fit into the polite, sophisticated noble society.

</div><p></p></li><li> Rabinovich. A sterotypical Russian Jew: smart, crafty, and very mercantile. A quintessential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a>. Most jokes revolve around Rabinovich finding improbable sources of income and, in older stories, vigorously hating the Soviet government. Nowadays, can become a slight <em>faux pas</em> (it should be noted, though, that most, if not all, of these jokes were created by Russian Jews themselves, and as such, even those seeming vaguely antisemitic are rather examples of the self-deprecation prominent in Ashkenazi humour). The most famous contemporary Rabinovich joke involves <em>Pamyat</em>, a Russian ultra-nationalist (and thus antisemitic) group:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Pamyat</strong>: Pamyat headquarters, what is the nature of your inquiry?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: Is it true that the Jews have sold Russia out?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Pamyat</strong>: Damn right!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: Woohoo! So...where can I go to get my share?
</div><ul><li> Sometimes Rabinovich is a <em>otkaznik</em>, or at least discusses emigrating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich's Friend</strong>: Rabinovich! I thought you would have emigrated to Israel by now!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: Why? I can feel just as miserable right here.
</div><ul><li> Or another one, when Rabinovich is applying for permission to move to Israel:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Official</strong>: Your application says you have no relatives abroad, but elsewhere you mention you have a brother in Tel Aviv. How can this be true?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: Yes, but <em>he's</em> not abroad, <em>I</em> am!
</div><ul><li> It's often political due to the special immigration leeway granted by Israel:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> During his visit to Israel (or America), Rabinovich has sent a telegram back to the office he works at, saying "I have chosen freedom". The office soviet decides to denounce him on the next monthly meeting.
</div><div class="indent"> To everyone's surprise, he shows up at the meeting.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: I know where I meant when I said freedom, but do you?
</div><ul><li> And, inevitably, sometimes he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew">Greedy Jew</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>Rabinovich and his wife, Sarah, are lying in bed together. Rabinovich can't get to sleep, and is fidgeting nervously. Eventually, his wife can't take it any more</em>:
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Sarah</strong>: For pity's sake, love! What's the matter?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: You know Levi from the next tenement? I borrowed ten rubles from him the other day.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Sarah</strong>: But you don't <em>have</em> ten rubles!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: I know, and that's why I can't sleep!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Sarah</strong>: (*<em>sighs, then opens the window and shouts out</em>) LEVI? LEVI!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Levi</strong>: (*<em>from his own window across the street</em>) <em>What?</em>
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Sarah</strong>: You know those ten rubles my husband borrowed from you? Well, he's not giving them back! (*<em>slams window, turns back to Rabinovich</em>) There. Now just you settle down and let Levi be the sleepless one!
</div><ul><li> Or (while Rabinovich is at last at the airport to go to Israel):
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Soviet Customs Official</strong>: *points to a hefty miniature statue* What is that?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabinovich</strong>: <em>What</em> is that? <em>WHAT</em> is that? Do not say <em>what</em> is that, say <em>who</em> is that!

</div><p></p></li><li> Vovochka (a diminuitive form of "Vova", itself, in turn, a diminutive form of "Vladimir"). A stereotypical Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">school student</a> (depending on the story, his age may vary from kindergarten to high school): not too bright, not interested in studying, either, prone to underage drinking, smoking, and swearing. Think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">Bart Simpson</a>, only sometimes worse. He's apparently a subversion of young Vladimir Lenin, who was a role model character in many didactic tales for children. His most common counterpart is Marivanna (shortened of "Maria <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Patronymic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Patronymic">Ivanovna</a>"), a stereotypical Russian schoolmarm, whose portrayal varies from sympathetic to outright offensive. Ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin">Vladimir Putin</a> got elected President, the joke-tellers went meta and started considering Vovochka anecdotes political jokes.
<ul><li> The teacher asks the class to produce a word that starts with the letter "A"; Vovochka happily raises his hand and says "Asshole!" The teacher, shocked, responds "For shame! There's no such word!" "That's strange," says Vovochka, "the asshole exists, but the word doesn't!"
</li><li> Vovochka is peeking through the keyhole of his parents bedroom: "And <em>these</em> people won't let me pick my nose"
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and Dr. Watson, mostly based upon their portrayal by Vasiliy Livanov and Vitaly Solomin in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSherlockHolmesAndDoctorWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSherlockHolmesAndDoctorWatson">the 1980s Soviet film adaptation</a> of Conan Doyle's works. The content is similar to the Stirlitz jokes above, only less centered on puns and more on Holmes' improbable ingenuity in deduction, and Watson acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a>.
<p></p><div class="indent"> Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were going camping. They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: "Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you see." Watson replied: "I see millions and millions of stars." Holmes said: "And what do you deduce from that?" Watson replied: "Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, its quite likely there are some planets like Earth out there. And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life." And Holmes said: "Watson, you idiot, somebody has stolen our tent!"
<p></p><ul><li> This one had legs: it made its way west and won an English-language joke contest in the mid-2000s.
</li></ul></div><p></p><ul><li> Another prominent theme is making fun of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian Britain</a> stereotypes, especially porridge, which is believed to be the primary food of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuintessentialBritishGentleman">Quintessential British Gentleman</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Watson</strong>: Holmes, what is this terrible howling? Is this the Hound of Baskervilles?

The stereotype of arrogant and poorly educated post-Perestroika businessmen and gangsters, who seized enormous wealth in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> and were driving around in Mercedes cars and expensive suits, but have no idea what "style" is, only price. Typical plots involve them interacting with each other, bragging about their ill-gotten wealth, or with normal, poor but well-educated people. Or they are rammed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> of a Mercedes, an old ugly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">Zaporozhets</a>.
<div class="indent"> A Mercedes Benz stops at a traffic light. Suddenly, a Zaporozhets comes from behind and collides with it. Five thugs get out of the Mercedes and drag the driver of the Zaporozhets out. 'Okay, dude, we see now that you don't have any money, so we'll just beat the crap out of you for trashing our car,' they say. The man looks at them and says: 'Wait, boys, isn't it unfair for five people to attack one?' The thugs get together and discuss this for a little, then return to him and say: 'You are right, it is unfair. Here, Kolya and Vova will fight on your side.'"
</div><ul><li> The sheer chaos of when anything could turn out in any way was also another source of jokes.
<ul><li> A Mercedes stops, and an old Zaporozhets crashes into it. Two goons in suits get out, approach an old man in his old car and ask him: "Hi, now you owe us so-o much... you're going to pay or we'll talk ...differently?" Old dude replies "Ah, I haven't much money with me, perhaps you need to talk with my son." "And who's your son?" "Chief of the poultry farm." "Well, call him." Five minutes later an armored carrier stops nearby and several big, armed troopers jump out. "Dad, how many times must I tell you? My job's not called <em>Chief of the Poultry Farm</em>, but <em>Commander of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkut_(special_police_force)">Golden Eagle Special Detachment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>..."
</li></ul></li><li> After an operation, the surgeon tells the patient: "We'll have to operate again, I forgot a glove inside of you". The patient, a New Russian, replies: "Here's a hundred bucks, go buy yourself a new one".
</li><li> One New Russian is boasting to another: "Look, this tie cost me 600 dollars!" The other replies: "You've been had, they sell the same ties round the corner for 1000 dollars!"
</li><li> A New Russian exits the Hermitage Museum (former Russian Imperial Palace filled with priceless works of art): "Meh, what a hovel." (People around look at him reproachfully). "But a tidy one!"
</li><li> A police investigator asks a New Russian: "Do you have an alibi?" - "Yes, I do. Can I pay in foreign currency?"
</li><li> A New Russian is in an auto accident. He stumbles out of his car, and his left arm has been torn off. He starts yelling "Oh God, my car! My car!" A bystander says, "Your car? Look at your arm!" He looks down and says, "Oh God, my Rolex!"
</li><li> The quintessential new Russian joke about a Zaphorozhets and a New Russian's car is as follows:
</li></ul><div class="indent">A new Russian and an old man are lying next to each other in hospital.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>New Russian</strong>: So what are you in for?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Old Man</strong>: Auto accident.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>New Russian</strong>: Me too - what happened?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Old Man</strong>: I had an old Zaporozhets car, and I put my war-trophy Messerschmitt jet engine in it. While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it. My speed was too high, I lost control and crashed into a tree. And how did you get here?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>New Russian</strong>: I was driving my Ferrari when I saw a Zaporozhets overtaking me. I thought that my car might have broken down and was actually standing still. So I opened the door and walked out...
</div><p></p><ul><li> A New Russian meets his daughter's boyfriend for the first time. They are alone in a room and the New Russian starts asking a few questions:
</li></ul><p></p><div class="indent"> <strong>New Russian</strong>: So, do you have your own apartment already?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Boyfriend</strong>: Uhm.. actually not... but I believe God will help me!

</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Boyfriend</strong>: Er... I... don't really know yet.. but I'm sure God will help me with this one as well!
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> After a few more questions and answers like this the boyfriend leaves the room and goes home. The daughter comes to her dad and asks him:
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> <strong>Daughter</strong>: So, Dad, how do you like him?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>New Russian</strong>: Well he's kind of a loser, but he is honest and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswersToTheNameOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswersToTheNameOfGod">I really like what he calls me</a>.
</div><p></p></li><li> Animals. These jokes are based around animal behavior stereotypes, which have their roots in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RussianMythologyAndTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RussianMythologyAndTales">Russian Mythology and Tales</a>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolf">violent Wolf</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox">sneaky (female) Fox</a>, the cocky coward Hare, the strong, simple-minded Bear, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingOfBeasts">king of the animal kingdom, the Lion</a>. The Hedgehog is a complex case, since he is basically the all-round Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins">penguin</a>.
<ul><li> Also a cockerel or rooster, however jokes featuring a cockerel only really work if you know from the start of the joke he's supposed to be a closet homosexual: these jokes made more sense back when the Soviet Union criminalised homosexuality and have been dying out since the 90s. This comes from <em>petukh</em> (cockerel) being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianLanguage">Fenya</a> term for a passive homosexual. A typical story would be the Wolf, the hare and a cockerel in a holding cell awaiting trial and telling each other what they are in there for: the Wolf will go on a long story about how he started a fight and beat someone up, but that they deserved it and he doesnt deserve to be there, the hare will tell an equally long tale where he will come over as a cocky but cowardly thief, black-marketer or conman but that he doesnt deserve to be there because hes not really done anything that wrong, and the cockerel will listen to both of their long and complicated stories and then just say Me, oh. Im a political prisoner: I pecked [name of unpopular local bigwig/ Young pioneer/ Soviet new man] in the Arse.

</div><p></p></li><li> The Golden Fish is the Russian equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle">Genie in a Bottle</a> (with whom it is interchangeable), first appearing in a poem by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a>. The story usually revolves around a person finding/catching a Golden Fish and being granted three wishes, after which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. Sometimes, three people are granted one wish each.
<ul><li> A man catches a Golden Fish and asks it to make him a Hero of the Soviet Union. The next moment he finds himself with two grenades against five German tanks.
</li><li> "Three men, stranded on an island, catch the Golden Fish and are granted one wish each. The first one says: 'I want to go home,' and disappears. The second one says: 'I want to go home, too,' and also disappears. The third one says: 'I'm alone. I want a bottle of vodka and those two to come back here.'"
<ul><li> The joke is lost on non-Russians and even some modern Russians, but in the Soviet times three was considered the optimal number of people for collective drinking. The reason for that was that the price of a bottle of vodka was 2 roubles 87 kopecks, so if each person contributed a rouble they could buy a bottle and 13 kopecks' worth of snacks.
</li><li> A similar joke is common in the west, but usually has the three characters as a brunette, a redhead and a blonde. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Guess which one wishes for the other two to return?</a>
</li><li> And then there's the other variation with character traits and yet another one with nationalities. Now, guess who's the third nationality?
</li><li> Even more hilarity essues when different anecdotal archetypes meet together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">A New Russian once caught the Golden Fish and offered it three wishes</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Drunkards. These jokes usually revolve around a drunkard's ill-fated attempts to get another bottle of vodka, since sale of alcohol to drunk persons was outlawed in the Soviet Union.
<div class="indent">(A drunkard is urinating on a wall when a policeman passes by.)
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Policeman</strong>: What're you doing? There's a public toilet only a block away!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Drunkard</strong>: A block?! What, you think I've got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">damn fire hose</a> in my pants here?!
</div><p></p></li><li> Students, particularly university students, are popular joke fodder.
<ul><li> The first target is their love for drinking:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> It is the final end of year exam at the technical university. The exam is just about to begin when a student, obviously inebriated, stumbles through the door.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Student:</strong> Sorry, Proffyesur. I'm na' late, right?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Professor:</strong> No, you're right on time, in fact.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Student:</strong> Say, Professor, would yuh let a ddrunnk shtudent take da exam?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Professor:</strong> I certainly would allow it.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Student:</strong> <em>(yelling into the hallway)</em>: Is 'kay, guys. Wheeel 'em in.
</div><ul><li> Another target is their annoying tendency to leave all the studying for several weeks before exams.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A student dies and goes to hell. There the Devil offers him a choice: either he will go to regular hell, or to the version for students. He asks to see both. In regular hell he is told that it is almost normal life, except that every day a nail is driven into one's ass. Ouch! In student hell he's told that it is exactly like real student life. Obviously, he chooses student hell and has half a year of normal life. At the end of the semester the Devil comes with a bucket of nails:
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>The student:</strong>WTF???
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>The Devil:</strong> It is the end of the year and it's time for 'Сессия' ! (literally: several weeks of exams for material studies in previous half a year)
</div><ul><li> A third target is the stereotype that students are always poor, in constant need of money, or even starving.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A student walks down the hall and sees other student kick a bun along the wall.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Student:</strong> OH MY GOD, are you insane? That's a perfectly edible BUN!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Second student:</strong> Shhh! When I kick it out over the corner, we'll share it, ok?
</div><p></p></li><li> Policemen (-Militsiya- Politsiya since March 2011). These revolve around the stereotype of a dim-witted, corrupt law officer, prone to demanding bribes, which was formed during the worse times in the Soviet Union and Russia (read: 1990s).
<div class="indent"> Subversion: "A Toyota car is driving through downtown Moscow on a winter night and stops on a crossing where a policeman is keeping watch. A Japanese tourist gets out and asks the policeman: 'Oyasuminasai. Sumimasen, omawaru-san, doko de watashi wa kono yukitoshi ni Coca-Cola no kan'o koubaimasu ka?' The policeman hesitates a little, then replies: 'Excuse me, I didn't quite understand... You asked, where in this sad, snowy city you can buy a can of... what exactly?'"
<p></p><div class="indent"><strong>Q:</strong> Why do policemen travel in threes?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>A:</strong> One to read, one to write, and one to keep an eye on the two intellectuals.
</div><p></p><ul><li> Italians have the same joke on the <em>Carabinieri</em>, their version of the Gendarmerie. The <em>Carabinieri</em> are always presented as incredibly dim-witted.
</li></ul></div><p></p><ul><li> Another version of the same joke:
<div class="indent"><strong>Q:</strong> Why do policemen travel in threes?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rfy2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rfy2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rfy2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They do this in real life.</span>

(turns to the policeman C) Write them down.</a>
</div></li></ul><p></p><div class="indent"> Why do some policemen have a dog with them when they go on patrol? Because someone has to walk them back to the station at the end of their shift.
</div><p></p></li><li> Ethnic stereotypes. The Russians have a lot of ethnic stereotypes similar to Rabinovich above. A typical joke goes like "An Englishman, a French guy, and a Russian sit in a bar..." and is quite similar to analogous jokes in Anglophone humour. Favorite targets are:
<ul><li> Chukchi, the native people of Chukotka related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimoLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimoLand">Northwestern Native Americans</a>, are the all-time favorites, often seen as generally primitive, uncivilized and simple-minded, but clever and philosophic in a naive kind of way.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Chukchee:</strong> Hey, I was in the city and I purchased a TV.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Geologist:</strong> Dude, you need an outlet to plug the TV in!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Chukchee:</strong> Do you think I'm silly? I purchased an outlet too!
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> Another Chukcha was staying in a hotel and saw his first ever power outlet:
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Chuckcha</strong>: Oh, poor piggy! Who put you in the wall? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wofy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3wofy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wofy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Soviet power outlets were round with two small pin-shaped holes for the plug, and did indeed look vaguely like a pig's snout.</span>
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> <strong>Tourist</strong> (got lost in Tundra and in panic): People! He-e-elp!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Chukchee</strong> (sitting in his hillock, drinking tea): Ah. So here in Tundra it's "people!". And back in Moscow it's "hey you, plate with ears!", eh?

For instance, it is said that in common showers or public bathhouses it's best not to bend down for soap when Georgians are around.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A group of Georgians is taking a shower. Suddenly one of them drops the only bar of soap. "Well, there goes the bathing", says someone else with a sigh.
</div><div class="indent"> Why do Georgian bars have downward-sloping floors? It makes it easier to clean up the blood.
</div><div class="indent"> A Georgian comes to an urologist and, without a word, pulls out his member and plops it on the examination table. Doctor: "Does it itch?" Georgian: "No" Doctor: "Does it drip?" Georgian: "No" Doctor: "Then what?" Georgian: "It looks good, yeah?"
</div><div class="indent"> A mute Georgian wants to buy condoms. He walks into a drug store, pulls down his pants and puts his dick on the counter, along with some money. The pharmacist pulls down his pants too, puts his dick on the counter, and since his one is longer, he takes the money.
<p></p><ul><li> Also, widely perceived as buying their way through life (for a Soviet Republic, Georgia enjoyed a good amount of economic freedom and Georgians tended to be rich compared to the rest of the population). At the same time, their adherence to highlander honor was recognised.
</li></ul></div><div class="indent"> A Georgian in a restaurant gazes fondly at his new Ph.D. degree. The waiter asks sarcastically: "Expensive, was it?" "<em>Expensive</em>?" replies the Georgian indignantly. "It's a gift from my friends!"
<ul><li> In the 90s, many Georgians took to selling their national fast foods (often with ingredients of poor quality and/or dubious origin) on the streets in large Russian cities.
<div class="indent"> "Hey mister, did this meat bark or meow?" "It asked stupid questions."
</div></li></ul></div><ul><li> Armenians. Same as Georgians. Minus the Hotblooded part, enforce the homosexual tendencies, or at least fondness for anal sex. A meta joke has people telling Georgians jokes about Armenians and vice versa.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Why are all Armenians so lucky? Because even Luck is afraid to turn his back on them.
<ul><li> The fictional Armenian Radio is used in jokes with questions and answers (usually revolving around sex and politics).
<div class="indent"> <strong>Q:</strong> Will the new world war happen?

</div></li><li> Or this one:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Q</strong>: What is prohibited and what is permitted?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>A</strong>: Well, in England, what is permitted is permitted, and what is prohibited is prohibited. In America, everything is permitted, except for that which is prohibited. In France, everything is permitted, including that which is prohibited. In Germany, everything is prohibited, except for that which is permitted. And in the Soviet Union, everything is prohibited, including that which is permitted.
</div></li><li> Finally:
<div class="indent"> Peope ask the Armenian radio, what is the friendship of all nations? We reply: it's when the people of all Earth: Armenians, Azerbaijanians, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Frenchmen, Americans, all of them will gather in one place, hold their hands and go kick some Georgian ass.
</div></li><li> Armenians are also obsessed (justifiably) with being persecuted:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Old Armenian on deathbed</strong>: My children, above all else, <em>treasure the Jews.</em>

</div></li></ul></div><p></p><ul><li> Estonians and Finns are commonly seen as very slow-witted (partly due to their tendency to speak Russian very slowly compared to native speakers) and ironically referred to as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> Estonian/Finnish guys".

</div><p></p></li><li> Jews. See Rabinovich above.
<p></p></li><li> Chinese. Most jokes revolve around their sheer numbers and sometimes backwardness mixed with ambition.
<div class="indent"> As a measure to curb population growth, the Chinese Government decided to launch 100,000 astronauts on a one-way expedition to the Sun.
</div><div class="indent"> The Chinese Government asked for help in curbing population growth. Europeans, Americans and Japanese all offered latest developments in birth control, but they were all too slow and expensive. The Russians offered to do it for free and in an instant, and won the contract. So they lined up 100 million Chinese males, and commanded: "Ten-hut! Put down your pants! Turn to your right! Bend down and take your neighbour's balls in your mouth!" Then a soldier came to one end of the line, and kicked the first Chinese in the balls. The sound of "Chomp, chomp, chomp..." receded in the distance...
</div><ul><li> China's Great Leap Forward, which tried to compensate lack of technology with combined forces and enthusiasm, gave birth to a bunch of jokes.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A new Chinese plane crashed recently. Casualties: the passenger, 7 crew members and 3,000 pedallers.
</div><div class="indent"> The modern Chinese anti-tank squad consists of a thousand Chinese soldiers armed with wrenches. Their goal is to take the tank apart before it shoots.
</div><div class="indent"> Two submarines, one U.S. and one Chinese, collided in the Yellow Sea yesterday. American casualties: 50 sailors. Chinese casualties: 3,000 oarsmen.
</div><div class="indent"> In other news, the Chinese space expedition exceeded expectations: 200,000 Chinese didn't let go of the slingshot in time, and were launched into space along with the spacecraft.
</div><p></p></li><li> Alternatively, the jokes are about Chinese language, whose words often sound inherently funny or obscene to a Russian ear.
</li><li> The late Russian author Vasily Aksyonov told a story about a Soviet army officer he encountered in the late 1960's, at a time when tensions between the Soviet Union and China were at an all-time high, to the level of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict">open battles on their mutual border<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Anyway, the officer was crying his eyes out, and Aksyonov asked why. The other man sobbed, "If the Chinese invade us, they'll confiscate my new motorcycle!" Replied Aksyonov, "Aren't you worried that, if we go to war with the United States, the Americans would confiscate your motorcycle?" The officer stopped crying, looked at Aksyonov as though the latter were an idiot and replied scornfully, "Don't be stupid, comrade. The Americans respect private property."
<ul><li> This relates to a particularly dark joke/observation about students in Soviet universities (analogous to one invented in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanHumour">Germany</a> at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>):

</div><div class="indent"> Realists take Kalashnikov assault rifle.
</div><p></p><ul><li> Africans. In jokes, they are usually exchange students suffering from cold weather and explicit (yet unintended) racist sayings by straightforward Russians.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> An African exchange student writes a letter to his family:
</div><div class="indent"> "Dear Mom and Dad, my life here is unbearable. I could endure green winter, but when white winter came..."
<ul><li> An African student met on his turf in an anecdote is likely to be a chief of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalTribe">Cannibal Tribe</a>.
</li></ul></div><div class="indent"> Two African tribes established an alliance and conquered the third. One of victorious chiefs tells another while eating the defeated chief: "Not very tasty". "Yep. Though still better than what we had to eat at Lumumba University refectory". <em>(Lumumba University is a university in Moscow that specializes on educating foreigners, mostly from Third World countries).</em>
</div><p></p><ul><li> Russians. Largely self-referential humor, which sets Russian ethnic jokes apart from most others. The Russians are depicted as simple-minded, negligently careless, fond of alcohol but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong">physically robust</a>. Sometimes fatalistic about the general state of affairs.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> An American, a French guy and a Russian are on death row. They are put into empty detention cells, given two large steel spheres each and told they will be released if they can do something extraordinary with them. The next morning, their captors check on them. The American has managed to balance one sphere perfectly on top of the other. "Clever," say the judges, and they let him go. The Frenchman does a show in which he juggles them every way possible. "Impressive," say the judges, and they let him go. When they come to the Russian, they find him sitting there holding his head in despair. "What's the matter? Where'd your spheres go?" the judges ask him, astonished. He replies: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">I broke one and lost the other.</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">"Incredible!" say the judges,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">and they let him go.</a>
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> An American, a Frenchman and a Russian are all captured by the Nazis and sentenced to death. Each is allowed to choose the method of execution. The Frenchman goes first, and chooses a guillotine. But the guillotine is not working, so they set him free. As he passes by the American, he whispers: "The guillotine is broken", so the American also chooses the guillotine, and is also set free. As the American passes by the Russian, he whispers: "The guillotine is broken". "Well, since the guillotine is broken, - says the Russian, - then give me the firing squad!"
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> A Russian spy is caught by Nazis during WWII. They torture him all night long, but he doesn't tell them anying. They put him back in the cell and observe secretly through the peep-hole. The Russian is hitting himself on the head and saying: "Here's one for the restaurants! Here's one for the girls! I knew I should have been learning codes and secret addresses!" Finally he manages to escape. To his comrades, he says: "Guys, learn all this stuff! Or they beat the crap out of you in there!"
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> An American, a French guy and a Russian are sitting next to bonfire. The American says: "You know, I'm very proud of my nation. For example, I can swim 5 kilometers, run 20 kilometers, and not even break a sweat after all of this!". The Frenchman says: "Meh, our nation is way better. For example, I can swim 10 kilometers, run 40 kilometers, and not even break a sweat after all of this!". The Russian remained silent, only stirring the bonfire with his dick.

</div><p></p></li><li> "Industrial" jokes. Russians mock their own often ineffective and military-centered industry, as well as questionable work discipline and widespread workplace theft. There is a recurring theme of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> "language" that workers use  the extremely offensive but wonderfully versatile Russian Mat replacing all nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  with the traditional joke being that when their new boss orders them to clean up their language, the whole factory grinds to a halt. At the same time, these often proliferate the (often founded) myth of Russians possessing a miraculous resourcefulness, enabling them to achieve stupefying results seemingly effortless, with zero resources and despite total disarray surrounding them (Russians have a special word for that bedlam-like irresponsible disarray, <em>bardak</em> (lit. whorehouse), which they like to use to describe the state of things in the Motherland).
<div class="indent"> The Japanese have bought a license for an advanced Russian jet. They assemble it exactly by the blueprints, and it turns out to be a steam locomotive. They check the blueprints, gather their best engineers and assemble it again. Still locomotive. They file a complaint to the Russians, so the Russian team arrives, goes into the workshop and shortly produces a perfectly good jet. The Japanese are astonished: "We've tried it again and again and only got a steam train!" "Why, of course", reply the Russians, "did you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">Read the Fine Print</a>?

They visit cities, plants, R &amp; D centers... And eventually the program is concluded, Japanese delegation is about to board the plane home. "So, what do you think? How do you like USSR?" - Russians ask. "We cannot help but comment your children. Beautiful, smart, enegretic!" - Japanese reply. "Thank you! And what else?" - "Your children are just brilliant, really." But Russians insist: "Yes, but what you think of our technology? Manufacturing? R &amp; D?" - "Yes, Russian children are very, very good. And what you do using your hands is quite bad."
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> The CIA placed a bug in a Soviet rocket factory to gain intelligence about the manufacturing process.

</li></ul></div><p></p></li><li> Black humor. A very popular subgenre which makes fun of (and exaggerates) the more morbid aspects of Russian life, leading to a sometimes tilted perception of it by foreigners. These jokes frequently revolve around medicine (ill people and doctors), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> victims, and various disabilities.

</li></ul><div class="indent">A peasant dies and goes to Hell, but discovers when he gets there that there are actually two versions of Hell: Capitalist Hell and Communist Hell.

Being used to waiting in lines, of course, he stands in this one for as long as it takes, which is for more than a month. When he finally gets up near the gates, he sees a demon who looks a lot like Karl Marx standing at the gates and looking very exasperated at how slowly the line is moving.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Peasant</strong>: "So, what is Communist Hell like?"

<ul><li> The rhyme "I got bitten by a hippopotamus... So now I'm <em>here</em> and my leg's <em>over there</em>" is so mild a search shows it's recommended for a summer camp game that involves tracking the narrator's appendages already removed by that hippo in the long version. And a reminder that you don't want to play a chew toy for an ill-tempered living truck, however superfluous it <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=78270">seems<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to be.
</li><li> Here is an example of a less mild one:
</li></ul><div class="indent">'A girl in the field had once found a razor <br/>"What is this, daddy?" she asked in amazement. <br/>"It is a harmonica." daddy then says <br/>...And wider and wider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin">the grin</a> on her face.
</div></li><li> Some serious sicknesses are portrayed in a light-hearted manner as well. For instance, people with dystrophy are presented as fully able physically, but unnaturally thin and light:
<ul><li> A few patients in a hospital decide to play a game of hide-and-seek. Ultimately, everyone is found except the man with dystrophy. After the player who who was "it" gives up, the man with dystrophy comes out of hiding, grinning. Player: "Where were you?" Man with dystrophy: "Behind the fishing rod." Player: "I looked behind the fishing rod, you weren't there!" Man with dystrophy: "You didn't look behind the line."
</li><li> A doctor walks into the dystrophy ward. "Hello, eagles!" "We're not eagles, we're suffering from dystrophy." "Really, then who was flying around the ward yesterday?" "It wasn't our fault. The nurse forgot to shut off the vacuum cleaner upstairs."
</li></ul></li><li> Asylums. The stock joke is that the personnel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from their patients.

</div><div class="indent"> At the CYKA Asylum, a speaker comes in from the Party and gives a speech to the people there about how great Communism is. At the crescendo of his speech, he notices that there is one person who is not cheering excitedly. The speaker asks him "Why are you so discontent, Comrade?" The man replies "I'm not insane - I work here."
</div><ul><li> Incidentally, there's a same joke (?) about Mussolini.
</li><li> Well, this is not necessarily funny, because of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR, where dissidents got "diagnosed" with such things as "sluggish paranoid schizophrenia." One term for it was Kарательная психиатрия (punitive psychiatry). Some asylums got funny names, based on word-plays and later influenced internet culture.
</li></ul></li><li> Laughing at "not necessarily funny" (and actually kind of horrible) stuff is the standard operating procedure of Russian Humour. It's that kind of country.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Man, his wife and her lover - very popular story pattern. Almost always begins with "Man came home after business trip and his wife is with a lover". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. In this plot lover may try to hide in a wardrobe or under the bed, escape from the apartment or convince husband that he is not a lover.
<ul><li> A man came home after a business trip. The same day in the middle of the night a naked man with a knife jumps out of the wardrobe and shouts: "I am fugitive criminal Ivanov!" and then run through the door. A few seconds after that another naked man jumps out of the wardrobe and shouts "I am police detective Petrov, have you seen where fugitive criminal Ivanov went?" The confused husband gestured to the door. "Thank you, citizen - SWAT team, follow me!"
</li><li> A man comes home from a business trip. The wife opens the bedroom window and whispers to the lover: "Jump!" The lover responds: "Are you nuts? We're on the 13th floor!" Wife: "Jump, there's no time for superstitions!"
</li><li> Here is how men of different nationalities handle coming home from work and seeing their wives in bed with other men.
<ul><li> American men - "Ma'am, I demand a divorce!"
</li><li> British men - "Pardon me, I seem to have come at a bad time."
</li><li> French men - "May I join you?"
</li><li> Russian men - "What the <em>fuck</em> do you think you're doing? We still don't have any fish, and the queue is <em>two blocks long!</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> In heaven, God has decided that only the people with the worst death stories may enter. So the first guy shows up and god asks him what his story is. The man says "I came home from a business tripe to finding my wife naked in our bed, with our balcony door open. I knew she was cheating so I ran outside and saw a guy hanging on the balcony. So I took my hammer and hit his fingers until he fell. But he landed in some garbage and survived. So I took our wardrobe and hurled it off the balcony to finish him off. But it was too heavy, and I had a heart attack, so here I am." God thinks and lets him in. The next man comes up and God asks him what his story is. He says "I was working out on my balcony when I slipped and fell off. But I got lucky: I grabbed on to my downstairs neighbors balcony. But suddenly, this asshole comes out and starts hammering at my fingers until I fell off again. But I got lucky again: I fell on some soft garbage and survived. But this asshole then runs out onto his balcony and throws a damn wardrobe at me, so here I am." God thinks and lets him in. The next man comes up. God says "So, what's your story?" "Well," says the man, "imagine this: I'm hiding in a wardrobe..."
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Drug addicts, mostly depicted as weed smokers, are shown to be very slow and have an extremely weird logic.
<div class="indent"> A drug addict can get no job, for he's just too slow. Finally, he was hired by the zoo to clean the turtles cage. When the zoo officials came to check his work, he is found sitting in an empty cage. "You know, I only opened the door, and they all rushed out so fast..."
</div><ul><li> Two drug addicts are talking on the ninth-floor balcony.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>First:</strong> What do you think, if I fall down from here, how long will I fall?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Second:</strong> I don't know. Maybe, a week, maybe a month.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>First:</strong> So I'll die?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Second:</strong> Of course you will. Just imagine, falling down for the whole month, with no food, no water, no weed.
</div><p></p></li><li> Political/historical "anecdotes", a venerable genre that descended from anecdotes in the classical sense and was already quite popular in the early 19th century (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> was pretty fond of them). Those are mostly jokes about Russian (and later Soviet, and now Russian again) rulers, revolving around their most famous achievements and facts related to them mentioned in history textbooks, famous quotes (such as Lenin's "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country!", often treated as a mathematical formula that can therefore also be written as "Soviet power is communism minus electricity" and so on), other phrases commonly associated with them (like Peter the Great's "cutting a window into Europe") and various "characteristic traits", like Stalin's arbitrary trigger-happiness, Lenin's and Stalin's funny accents, Brezhnev's senility, ill-health, and love of medals, and Yeltsin's alcoholism. Stalin jokes seem particularly popular no matter what, though, probably because he fits the archetype of the smug, whimsical, unrestrained tyrant so very well and also happens to overlap with ethnic jokes about Georgians:
<div class="indent"><strong>NKVD major:</strong> "We arrested this man for treason!"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Stalin (with an untranslatable thick Georgian accent):</strong> "What did he do?"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>NKVD major:</strong> "He was saying: "Damn that mustached bastard for ruining the country!""
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Stalin:</strong> "Is that so? And who did you mean by that, comrade?"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Russian everyman:</strong> "Naturally I meant Hitler, comrade Stalin!"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Stalin (very smug, accent very thick):</strong> "And who did <em>you</em> mean, comrade major?" ("A <em>vi</em>, tavarisch mayor?" in original "Russian"; the "vi" instead of "vy" is a particularly common Georgian accent trope. Emphasizing "you" when it could make someone sweat was his habit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.)
</div><ul><li> A good illustrated example of such a joke: <a class="urllink" href="http://asylums.insanejournal.com/scans_daily/132183.html">Hitler vs. Stalin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, by Alexey Lipatov, with translations from Thomas Silbey. Featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetPackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetPackHitler">Stupid Jet Pack Hitler</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience">Soviet Superscience</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo">Ghostapo</a> and whatever its Soviet equivalent might be.
</li><li> Stalin is giving a speech in front of the Party, when in the middle of a pause someone sneezes. He asks who sneezed, but there is total silence. He continues to ask, finally threatening to have the front row shot if no one owns up. No one does, so the guards open fire on the first row. Still no one confesses, so they shoot the second row, the third row, etc. Finally the culprit can't take it anymore and yells out "I did it! I'm the one who sneezed!" Stalin responds "Bless you, comrade!"
</li><li> Stalin, Khruschev, Brezhnev and Gorbachov are traveling along the country when the train breaks down and stops moving. Stalin gets up, says to the other three, "I'll handle this," walks to the head of the train and shoots the conductor. He then returns and the four of them sit for awhile, the train still doesn't move. So Khruschev gets up, says "I will fix this," hires a new conductor, gives him higher wages, then goes back to his seat. The train still isn't moving. Brezhnev turns to his colleagues and says, "Comrades, I have the solution. Let us pull down the shades and pretend the train is moving". Gorbachov, bored to hell, runs out of the train, soon returns and says: "Comrades, I've found out why we aren't moving. The rails ahead of us are missing. Let's dismantle the rails behind the train and put them in front!" They exit the train and start disassembling the rails and dragging them ahead. When they repair the tracks completely, they find out that the train is gone: Yeltsin stole it.
</li><li> Supplemented recently with the jokes about the peculiar nature of the Putin/Medvedev duo, namely the ambiguous distribution of power between them:
<div class="indent"> Medvedev makes last-minute preparations for a speech. His aide suddenly addresses him:
</div><div class="indent"> "Dmitry Anatolievych, you've got a string caught on your sleeve. Oh, and on the other one too!"
</div><div class="indent"> Putin intervenes:
</div><div class="indent"> "Leave them be. These are much needed strings."
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> Putin and all the other senior Russian officials are having a dinner at the restaurant. Waiter starts taking orders:
</div><div class="indent"> "What will you have, Vladimir Vladimirovich?"
</div><div class="indent"> Putin says: "I will have meat: a steak, kebab and some bacon."
</div><div class="indent"> "Vladimir Vladimirovich, and how about the vegetables?"
</div><div class="indent"> (Taking a short look around): "Vegetables will also have meat."
<p></p></div><div class="indent"> "Vladmir, I don't think I will have the time to mow the lawn before the news, may I do it after?
</div><div class="indent"> "Of course, Dmitry, you are the president after all."
</div><ul><li> This one also contains a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>, since the original joke was about a husband and a wife, ending with "You are the man of the family, after all".
</li></ul><p></p><div class="indent"> Medvedev decides to follow Putin's steps and go fishing, and suddenly he catches a golden fish. A fish offers him three wishes. "Okay", he thinks, "there's a proverb that Russia has two major troubles: fools and roads. So I'll fix the things with fools, roads and get myself a next generation iPhone". "Fix the roads" he says, and at once all Russian roads are covered with excellent pavement, all bridges are repaired, new ones are built, so the roads look like German ones. "Now fix the fools", he says, and in an instant he changes his mind about an iPhone.
</div><p></p></li><li> As said before, Jewish humor and political humor often goes hand in hand in Russia. A notable example is this:
<div class="indent">Brezhnev flies into Odessa (one of the most Jewish cities in the former USSR) and is walking around. He notices that no one is there to greet him. He stops a cop and, complaining about no one noticing him, takes the man's gun and shoots it into the air. Still nothing happens, and no one comes out. So Brezhnev fires again. This time, a window above him opens, and a Jew leans out. He yells across the street "MONYA! What's going on?" Monya, across the street, opens his window and yells back "IZYA! Didn't you hear? Brezhnev came to visit!" Izya: "I heard that. Did the first bullet miss?"
</div></li></ul><p></p></li><li> Soviet/Russian deception (<em>maskirovka</em>) also has its own category of jokes:
<div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisYeltsin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisYeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> have agreed to temporarily exchange secretaries as a sign of peace. After awhile, Clinton's secretary writes back to Washington, "Everything is fine, but the President keeps asking me to lengthen my skirt. Pretty soon, my feet won't be visible at all." Yeltsin's secretary writes back to Moscow, "Everything is fine, but the President keeps asking me to shorten my skirt. Pretty soon, my holster and balls will be visible."
</div><ul><li> And another one involving the dual purpose of some hardware:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> TASS is reporting that there was an incident yesterday on the Sino-Soviet border. A peacefully-plowing tractor was subject to an unprovoked attack by Chinese forces. The tractor retaliatory barrage suppressed the enemy artillery. TASS is authorized to declare that, should the incident be repeated, the area will be reinforced with seed drills, winnowings and VTOL threshing machines, and noone will be held responsible if a couple of Chinese provinces lay in ruins. (<em>TASS was the Soviet news agency.</em>)
</div><p></p></li><li> After the breakdown of the Soviet Union, ex-Soviet states soundly cursed everything soviet.
<div class="indent"> Turkmenian historians wrote a book about the bloody crimes of the Soviets. Russian soldiers invaded their towns, leaving in their wake schools, hospitals and libraries and imprisoning innocent people whos only crime was slaughtering the neighbor's family.
</div><ul><li> A lot of people, especially in Baltic states, changed their names to the local models.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> A Latvian man comes out of his house and whistles for his dog:
</div><div class="indent"> - Sharik, Sharik, come to me!
</div><div class="indent"> No response. He repeats it, still to no avail. Finally, he remembers:
</div><div class="indent"> - Sharikas! Sharikas!
</div><div class="indent"> - Woofs! Woofs!
</div><p></p></li><li> KGB<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note672y8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note672y8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note672y8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This stands for State Security Committee (Комитет Государственной Безопасности), but a somewhat ironic expansion is Deep Drilling Bureau (Контора Глубокого Бурения). Modern day FSB (Федеральная Служба Безопасности, Federal Security Services) is a direct inheritor of this Bureau, and the word Bureau is often used to reference secret agencies in general.</span> also gets its own share of jokes:
<div class="indent"> A group of students in a dorm are drinking late at night and telling political jokes. One of them is tired and wants to sleep. He goes down to the lobby and asks the lady on duty to come up to the dorm with cups of coffee in a few minutes. He goes back up, waits a minute, picks up a vase, and speaks into it, "Comrade Major, please bring us some coffee." A minute later, the lady shows up with the coffee. All the students go quiet. In the morning, the student wakes up and sees that he's alone. He goes down to the lobby and asks the lady where everyone went.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Lady</strong>: Comrade Captain liked your little joke about Major.
<p></p></div><div class="indent">Two men are drinking in a train coach, exchanging political jokes. Suddenly, one says he need to leave.
</div><div class="indent">- So you need to turn over a tape in your hidden recorder?
</div><div class="indent">- Yes.
</div><div class="indent">- Never mind then, you can copy mine later.
<p></p></div><div class="indent">A MI6 agent, a CIA agent, and a KGB agent are in the woods and told to find a bear. They go off and search for a while, after which the MI6 agent and the CIA agent return emptyhanded. "After searching the woods," the MI6 agent says, "I have been unable to find a bear." "After searching the woods," the CIA agent says, "I have determined that bears do not exist." At that point their attention is drawn by a sound in the woods. Upon investigating, they find the KGB agent beating a rabbit. "We already have confessions from your friends and family!" he yells, "Admit that you're a bear!"
<p></p></div><div class="indent">- (with a distinctive Jewish accent) Hello, is it KGB? - Yes, it is. - What time is it now? - Quarter to eight. - Hello, is it KGB? What time is it now? - Ten minutes to eight. - Hello, KGB? What time is it now? - Rabinovich, stop this now, come and get back the freakng alarm clock we confiscated while searching your room.
