<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Kaioken technique introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">supposedly</a> risked permanent damage to Goku's body whenever he used it — especially when he overclocked it. However, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">My Kung Fu Is Stronger Than Yours</a>, by the time he's fighting against Frieza, he can multiply it by twenty-fold with fairly limited drawbacks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Goku learns to combine Kaio-Ken X 10 with the Super Saiyan Blue form, but the first time Goku tried it, it was still a work in progress and initially only had a 10% success rate, with the other 90% spelling severe injuries or even death</span>.
</li><li> Super Saiyan 3 is another example. A few minutes of use drained Goku (who was dead at the time, but who was given 24 hours of life force so he could visit his family) of about 12 hours of his life force, and Gotenks, who burned out his 30-minute fusion in 5 minutes. Goku eventually manages to mostly iron out this flaw, but by the time he does, Super Saiyan 3 has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a>.
<ul><li> Brought up once again in the Future Trunks arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. It's revealed that the Kai's Fusion earrings are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only permanent for Kais. For mortals, the fusion lasts 1 hour (which was the real reason they defused when absorbed by Super Buu). Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Vegeta use them to form Vegeto Blue, but the combination burns so much energy that the fusion lasts only about 5-10 minutes.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Also from the Future Trunks arc. The fusion between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku Black and Zamasu</span> is literally a deadly upgrade for the latter. He is immortal, but the other half is a mortal. By fusing with him it means that his body is now half-mortal, thereby making him mortal and finally killable - albeit insanely powerful and still nigh-invulnerable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballGT">Dragonball GT</a></em> reveals that by taking control of the transformation into an ape, a Saiyan can reach Super Saiyan 4, which Goku and Vegeta can maintain <em>without</em> exhausting themselves. However, the real problem comes when they perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> into Gogeta against Omega Shenron, who has enough power to waste their galaxy if he wanted. Gogeta can use <em>both</em> Goku's and Vegeta's deadliest attacks <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">as one,</a></em> the first hit knocking out Omega Shenron's stolen Dragon Balls, and the second would've <em>killed</em> the weakened Syn Shenron...but he's too much of an idiot clown to do the job soon enough. Instead, he forgets the fusion will only last 30 minutes, and wastes precious time screwing with the dragon on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">cheap parlor tricks.</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04qfq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04qfq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04qfq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It wasn't a goof-off waste of time. He was purposefully acting that way in order to get Shenron to use his negative karma attack so that he could reflect it and convert it into a positive karma attack, thereby dispelling the cloud surrounding the Earth. It just took too long to get that job done before "getting serious".</span> When Gogeta <em>does</em> try to execute the final blow...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">the fusion comes undone...</a>with less than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">ten</a></em> minutes elapsed. And they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">pay</a></em> for it...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>: Every exorcist has a synchronizing rate with their empathetic weapon. If they force their Innocence to go over this rate, they can gain a power boost but their bodies break down and they suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROd">Heroic RR Od</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a></em> wrote a horror story called <em>Dying Young</em> in the anthology <em>Flesh-colored Horror.</em> The premise involved about a mysterious contagious symptom that makes girls incredibly beautiful, but eventually causes the girl to drop dead in a couple months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>'s transformation into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">full-demon form.</a> His demonic blood devours a little more of his mind every time, so his demonic form becomes more and more uncontrollable. When he first transforms, he sounds like Inuyasha on a <em>really</em> bad day, but by the end of the series, his full demon form is incapable of speech and Kagome is unable to snap him out of it.
<ul><li> And as an inversion, he can also transform into human form during the nights of the New Moon. What makes this a "Deadly Upgrade"? Simple; in human form, he loses all of his demonic powers, meaning he's easy prey for any of the demonic enemies he's made in his life...or, indeed, any true demon that realizes what he is, as half-demons are almost universally despised by their full-blooded kindred.
<ul><li> Furthermore, he only transforms when facing down enemies it would take him literally seconds to kill with full power. These episodes are usually both awesome and frustrating. His human form can sometimes fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> as well, as being a human allows him to circumvent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> things that would be dangerous or otherwise lethal to anyone with demonic blood, such as the demon purifying barrier of Mt. Hakurei. He's still got all the disadvantages of being mortal, but it's saved his bacon more than once.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Almost every extremely powerful technique in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is some version of this.
<ul><li> The various stages of Naruto's Jinchuriki transformation, from Versions 1 and 2, to Partial Transformation, to Tailed Beast Mode all involve the Fox's influence gradually taking over Naruto's mind, body, and soul. If he goes past the 4-Tailed form, nothing but the words of encouragement from his father and mother can save him from the Fox's wrath. This also lessens Naruto's lifespan, not that that matters when he's the descendant of a clan known for its natural longevity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto eventually tames Kurama and gains access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">five minutes of using Kurama's maximum power.</a></span>
</li><li> Naruto's upgraded Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken, is basically a magical fletchette bomb that attacks targets at a cellular level, inflicting massive and very hard-to-heal damage. Unfortunately, since it's held in the hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">it does this to the user as well.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naruto removes this weakness by perfecting the technique to the point where he can throw it, getting it far enough away from himself that he isn't hit by it.</span>
</li><li> Tsunade possesses a technique that allows her to instantaneously regenerate by speeding up her cell division which means it also shortens her lifespan. She is also a descendant of the Senju/Uzumaki clans, so how much this actually matters is currently unknown.
</li><li> <em>Naruto</em> also has Rock Lee, whose power revolves solely around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a>, in that he can open up certain chakra gates to gain large power boosts at the expense of damaging his body. The more gates he opens, the more injured he becomes, and if he were to open up all gates, he would become extremely powerful for a short time and then die.
<ul><li> Might Guy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">uses all Eight Gates at one point, giving him strength and speed surpassing even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Tailed Beast Mode Naruto</a> only to collapse into a pile of ash and bone fragments once all his energy reserves are used up. The end result was avoided with Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a>, but even his powers couldn't save Guy's leg.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Choji's Three Colored Pills each give as successive boost in chakra, but burn out the user's body. The final, red pill instantly burns all the fat from his body and converts it to energy, but nearly kills him in the process. It would likely be fatal to anyone who's <em>not</em> as fat as he is. The pill also causes the user's cells to break down. When he takes it, he nearly dies and is only saved by intensive medical care and medicine from the Nara clan.
</li><li> Simply implanting Hashirama Senju's cells into a person's body can grant them enhanced regeneration and sometimes even the ability to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Wood Release techniques.</a> However, the cells can grow explosively if not properly controlled, transforming living flesh into a tree.
</li><li> The Mangekyo Sharingan will eventually render its user blind and result in extreme fatigue. Excessive use of Amaterasu can cause the user's eye to bleed. Sasuke was nearly rendered blind after he used it liberally in a misguided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>. The only fix is to take someone else's Sharingan and implant them as your own.
<ul><li> Izanagi will grant the user a moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a>, but permanently blinds the Sharingan used.
</li></ul></li><li> Orochimaru's Curse Seal allows the person to use more chakra, and increases their attack power, but using it for too long will corrupt them and the seal will completely take over. Sasuke was unusually capable of controlling this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the otherwise unstoppable transformation of the person from whom the Curse Seal originated. But now Sasuke seems to have lost the Curse Seal altpgether in his fight with his brother.</span>
</li><li> In the fillers, Kagerou's Ephemeral Vengeance technique seemingly shortens her lifespan, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though it is not what kills her.</span>
</li><li> Pain (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagato</span>) used the Demonic Statue to suck out the souls of Hanzo's men, which emaciated his body. Later, Pain's jutsu that destroys much of Konoha shortens his lifespan. Even just maintaining his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> and using any of his jutsu wreaks havoc on his <em>real</em> body.

</li></ul></li><li> People who possess the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> in the anime of the same name can give up half of their remaining life span to gain the ability to discover the true name (which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">by the rules,</a> they need to know to kill a person) of anyone whose face they can see. An even larger downside is that if they lose their Death Note, they lose the power— but also the half of their remaining life they sacrificed. If they find their Death Note again, they have to sacrifice half of their remaining life again to regain the power, meaning they'd only have 25% of their original remaining life span left.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>, no one's life is literally in danger, but junior high tennis is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">taken very seriously,</a> so permanent physical damage may well be equal to death, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">even worse.</a>
<ul><li> One of the earliest example is the Hadoukyuu, a powerful shot that hurts the arm of whoever hits it, as well as whoever is bold, or stupid, enough to try to return it. Used initially by Ishida Tetsu, who then passes it on to Kawamura Takashi, who develops a Dash version which is even more destructive. Then we meet the big brother of Tetsu, Gin, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredandEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredandEight">108</a> levels of this move, of which level ONE is equal to the Dash version. Despite this, Gin loses to a fluke which is widely seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">a cop out.</a>
</li><li> Tezuka Kunimitsu, widely regarded as one of the best players in the series has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrades</a>. The Zero-Shiki Drop Shot and the Invincible Tezuka Zone place considerable stress on his left arm, but he still manages to go into a 37-35 tiebreaker, which is ridiculous for tennis. Later on, these both get upgraded into a serve version, making it literally unreturnable, and a Reverse Zone, which places SIX times the burden on his arm, making it turn a deep purplish hue by the end of the match. Obviously, none of his teammates want him to sacrifice his arm for the sake of victory, seeing that he has a promising professional career in his future. Ironically, in the matches where these are first unveiled, he loses, creating blots on an otherwise perfect official record.
</li><li> Another ridiculous technique will ruin one's shoulders, since these players have only hit puberty, and their bodies are still maturing. Yet another one ruins the player's legs, because he's been running at hyper speeds. There's even a player who literally becomes a devil, complete with bloodshot eyes and newly-turned-white hair.
</li><li> The most ridiculous example of this trope is the Pinnacle of Perfection, which appears to take the player who achieves this state to a higher plane of existence, but at the cost of losing all of his memories, including those of how to play tennis, rendering this upgrade, at face value, essentially useless. Currently, not surprisingly, the main character is believed to have obtained this state, seeing as how the manga is finally coming to an end. However, it turns out the Pinnacle of Perfection has no drawbacks. It is revealed that Ryoma used it during his match with Kintarou, before losing his memories. Losing his memories was because of an accident, not because of the Pinnacle of Perfection.

<ul><li> Tony Tony Chopper (a reindeer who can become a humanoid with the power of the Person-Person Fruit) can access four additional forms besides his animal, human, and hybrid forms with the use of pills called "Rumble Balls". However, if Chopper takes more than two Rumble Balls within six hours, he turns into a mindless hulking monster. Not only is this move dangerous to those around him (due to his mindless rampaging), but it causes internal bleeding (shown by the blood coming from his mouth, despite never being harmed), making it lethal for himself as well. It's because Chopper's Monster form requires massive amounts of energy to keep going, far more than Chopper actually has. In addition, Chopper is essentially unconscious while he's in that form so he can't leave it on his own. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, he learned how to control it, but it still renders him too weak to move after using.
</li><li> Gear Second not only drains Luffy's stamina faster than normal, but according to Rob Lucci, it shortens his lifespan by increasing his metabolism. Lucci also states that if Luffy were not a rubber man, his heart would explode if he used the technique. Of course, if he wasn't made of rubber, he probably couldn't do it in the first place. It is likely that similar to Chopper above, his greatly increased stamina after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> renders these limits moot.

Unfortunately, Princess Serenity is something of a sociopath in that series that doesn't care if she hurts anyone to kill the monster of the day, constantly plays a harp that is actually feeding the energy of Queen Metaria and accelerating the destruction of the planet, summons monsters to beat the crap out of her friends when they try to stop her...oh, and she's perfectly happy to <em>destroy the world and kill everyone on it</em> if anything happens to her lover. Needless to say, this makes Princess Serenity as much of a threat as the Dark Kingdom at the end of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> almost entirely revolves around the caveat that when the series' eponymous half-demons overclock their powers too far they turn into monsters far more dangerous than those they were created to destroy; some of the more powerful of these 'awakened ones' are the primary villains of the series.
<ul><li> However, Claymores who have gone past their limit and managed to return to normal are able to do so more easily, allowing them to use more of their power, provided they don't go TOO far past their limit. However, it's theorized by said Claymores that they may still be awakening because of it, just very, very slowly.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior">Rockman.EXE</a></em> anime series did this in their final two seasons, with a twist - Rockman didn't control his transformation, a child named Trill did. Sometimes this worked out, like when Rockman was fighting the very giant Cyber Beasts he was drawing his transformation from, and sometimes it didn't, forcing the other characters to devise a complicated plan to capture him and settle him down which usually failed several times.
<ul><li> The parallel game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a> 6</em>, played with the same mechanic. In battle, you can take the beast form for three turns, after which you drop into a weakened, untransformed state. Of course, you can do it again, which puts you totally out of control and attacking randomly, and if <em>that</em> doesn't win you the battle, you go into a state so tired and weakened that you have to continue the battle at a pretty significant disadvantage. Of course, it doesn't stop the writers from arranging chapters where Mega Man is forced into uncontrolled transformation and you have to lug some other character over to put him down and get him back to normal.
</li><li> In 4 and 5, the player can gain certain "Dark Chips". They are a variation of normal chips (there's Dark Fan, Dark Vulcan and so on), but with immense power and ability to change the tide of a fight. There are, however, two drawbacks. One is that every time Mega Man uses the chip, his HP lowers by 1 permanently. Also, the more he uses Dark Chips, the faster he will be placed under "Dark Mega Man" state. He becomes a super-powerful rampaging machine that randomly uses Dark Chips, moves chaotically and doesn't stagger when being hit, but he also slowly loses HP until he reaches 1, at which point he goes back to the normal state. The only saving grace for 4 is the ability to have multiple playthroughs, so you can recollect HP upgrades and basically negate the HP downs. It's made a bit better in BN5, where you sacrifice a chip of a certain type to go into a cross form, but using them regularly will permanently shave 1 HP off your max limit per use. <br/>Later on, Mega Man gets the ability to do this with Dark Chips. Chaos Unisons (as they're called) allows Mega Man to use (most) effects that he can use in a regular Cross, with the addition of being able to use the Dark Chip sacrificed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a>. Fail the charge, though, and Dark Mega Man will show up— on the enemy's side. In addition, you only have the ability for one turn, the failure window for the charge doubles each time you use the Dark Chip, and you lose the ability to use the corresponding normal Cross for that battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">And then you realize the charge releases instantaneously if you let go of the fire button while the game is paused, and you can see what state the charge is in...</a>

At its first appearance, there is quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> over how crazy the man who forged the sword was to put in that form.

At the end of the series, however, she deploys a new Blaster Mode, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP">causes direct physical damage to herself and her weapon as a result of drastically boosting her power</a>. Of course, by the time she receives this, she already has a known tendency to use techniques and upgrades that pushes her body to the breaking point, so instead of telling her not to use it, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">long-time partner</a> tells her not to <em>over</em>use it.

It's possible to combine the two for more power, but doing so rips apart the muscles and puts heavy strain on the mind. Of the two who've used it, one ended up in a wheelchair. The other one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died, but for unrelated reasons.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em>, D-Boy/Blade's constant transformation from human to Tekkaman and back is disintegrating his central nervous system (the other human-based Tekkamen were also going to die as a result of incompatabilities). When he gets his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> upgrade, in at least the Australian version "Teknoman", the main villain comments that this upgrade causes death within a few months, and it is shown to cause D-Boy/Blade to lose memories as a result of transformation instead of having its previous deleterious effect on the central nervous system. <br/>So long as a Tekkaman was fully converted with an intact crystal then they could switch between forms with no penalty. The problem was that early on in the series D-Boy's crystal was broken and although the shards were placed on Pegas to allow transformation it was flawed and and repeated use of the flawed transformation was what caused nervous system damage to him. It also meant that so long as he used the broken crystal he'd have a time limit before going berserk. It was also true that if a human and Tekkaman plant weren't completely compatible, then they'd eventually die (which is what happened to D-Boy's sister).

</li><li> Using the black blood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> is this, as the advantages given by that kind of madness (hardening the blood against injury, not caring about injuries you're receiving or giving because you're out of your mind) are negated by the consequences of doing so too much; the insanity could become permenant. Currently the heroes have gotten around this by being able to control insanity for their own uses. Whether this trick will continue to work remains to be seen.
<ul><li> The Nakatsukasa Purpose is originally seen to be this, but only because Black Star was going about using the Demon Blade mode the wrong way. Until he was beaten into re-thinking his approach, he was told explicitly that over-using the Forbidden Technique would kill him. Once Black Star faces the will inside the Demon Blade and declares that he will strive on the path of warrior to resolve the despair of fallen warriors, he became capable of using the mode without issues.

Then, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">temporarily</a> gives him the powers of a vampire, but after so many uses, the change becomes permanent.

Unfortunately, on top of the fact that these power boosts occur quicker than she has time to adjust to them (making them exponentially unstable), she still has her original powers, which logically "piggy-back" on the gains made by the empathy feedback loop.

Ankh warns that Combos will be addictive and otherwise deleterious to the user's mindset, which is true based on his experience, but proves to be inaccurate: OOO feeds off and amplifies the user's greed, and Eiji has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityImmunity">Insanity Immunity</a> due to utterly lacking worldly desires, making him largely immune to the dangers of the belt's power.

Baron's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Emergency Transformation</a> into an Over Lord grants him a monstrous form with vastly increased power, but the infected wound he used to access the form continues to slowly kill him.

Because of a mix of the time Kazumi spent tricking the villains into dosing him with the gas and the increased Hazard Level it granted him, Sento wasn't able to tune the form to be used safely, saying that were Kazumi to try and actually transform into Grease Blizzard, then it would be almost certainly fatal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which it was — Kazumi used the form in battle as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.</span>

</li><li> "The Fourth Horseman": An ascended ancient reverts to human form to help SG-1, but effectively overclocks his own brain to hold on to his godlike knowledge, eventually causing severe brain damage.
</li><li> "The Fifth Race" and "Lost City" both dealt with a device used to put information directly into one's brain; however, human brains are not advanced enough for it, and one's mind would eventually be totally overwritten by the knowledge transmitted.
</li><li> This happens to Daniel in "The Quest", though Merlin presumably controlled the information so it wouldn't kill him. However, as Mitchell pointed out, "you don't get fancy mind powers unless there has been major redecorating going on inside your skull!"
</li><li> The concept is lampshaded in the episode "200" where it is mentioned that to maintain the Status Quo, all that had to be done was to add a dangerous side-effect to any super-powers the characters may obtain.

</li><li> The second are Crazies, which use brain implants to coax the mind into pushing the body past its normal limits. The result is a character who is significantly stronger, faster, and more agile than a normal human, but the implants cause a lot of strain on the mind, eventually leading to a long list of insanities.

These drug-crazed killing monsters are called the Latin word for 'Destroyer' for a reason, enemies (or walls) don't last long when they are around. Eventually all of the genetic alterations, combat drugs, and bionics with which they are equipped overwhelm their hyperactive immune system and they overheat rather explosively. The only thing that keeps them alive between missions is that they are kept in cryogenic stasis.
<ul><li> While on smaller scale, most of Psykers too. Every single use of psychic power risks to attract Predators of Warp. Better make it count.
</li><li> The Tau Riptide Battlesuit has an experimental Nova Reactor, which enebles it to "super charge" its weapons, shields or jetpack, at the cost of the radiation overload potentially killing the pilot.

Anyone (ally or enemy) struck by it gains an enormous power boost, allowing them to effortlessly succeed at nearly anything...for about ten minutes. Each minute after the effect activates, the power drops a bit, until by the tenth it's gone entirely. The catch is, at no point does the subject of the attack notice the decline. To themselves, they remain an awe-inspiring, completely unstoppable force of nature. The madness creates elaborate excuses for failures and is permanent (barring healing magic, which does nothing to stop any feeling of depression in someone no longer effortlessly flawless).

Certain champions of the kingdom can be given special permission by kings and queens past to wear the ring properly and fight like a royal, but at the cost of permanent damage to their health that can end in death.
</li><li> The eponymous mark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarkOfTheNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarkOfTheNinja">Mark of the Ninja</a></em> is made of a plant toxin that, when applied to the skin, gives a variety of sense-enhancing powers to anyone with the tattoo but eventually drives them to murderous insanity. As such, people who accept the mark take an oath to commit suicide once their mission is over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate2">Baldur's Gate 2</a></em>, the PC is granted the ability to assume the form of the Slayer, a manifestation of his dead father Bhaal, the God of Murder. Not only does maintaining the transformation kill you, using it is an inherently evil act that lowers your reputation, and may cause you to turn on party members.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> Berserkers get the Frenzy skill, which more or less makes them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">Bloody Murder</a> Personified (blood weapons, Blood boost), but drains health over time. Though use of HP regeneration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Avatar items</a> can slow the process.
</li><li> The Berserker skill, Thirst, qualifies as well. At a cost of 12 percent of the berserker's max HP, bleeding damage is significantly increased, certain skills do more damage, and the berserker can absorb more HP from his slain enemies. This, combined with Frenzy, makes the berserker's HP unstable as it's constantly shifting upward or downward.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission">Front Mission</a></em> has a fair bit of these as shown in the video games and other media.
<ul><li> The Bioneural Device is a unique interfacing device that lets pilots control their machines with human-like precision, often allowing them to exceed said machine's limitations in performance. However, pilots must undergo special augmentation surgeries which don't always quite turn out for the best. Puppet Soldier users have greater control over their machine's motions, but their minds can be taken over and have their actions remotely controlled by a "puppet master". Doll Eye users have 360-degree vision and can control nearby electronic systems to some extent, but are subject to blindness and extreme eye pain if they are hit with flash bang grenades. S-Type users can control their machines as if they were their own bodies and can do incredible feats on the battlefield because of it, but they are physically affected by EMP attacks, their organ sensitivity is so high that even minor damage can be fatal, and they can suffer from massive memory loss. Puppet Soldiers show up in <em>2089</em> and <em>2089-II</em>. Doll Eyes appear in <em>2089-II</em> and the <em>Dog Life &amp; Dog Style</em> manga. Finally, S-Types can be seen in <em>2089</em>, <em>2089-II</em>, <em>1st</em>, <em>Online</em>, <em>5</em>, and <em>Dog Life &amp; Dog Style</em>.
</li><li> While it isn't exactly like the other Bioneural Devices, the B-Type also counts in a way. The B-Type is a device which is powered by a human brain and when put inside a machine, allows for autonomous control of it. Machines can attack targets or evade enemy fire without needing input from its pilot. The downside? B-Type devices are very unstable and have led to the deaths of pilots using machines with them, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> such as Laurent Connely when his B-Type-powered wanzer stopped moving and he was shot to death by nearby OCU units.</span> Appears in <em>1st</em> and <em>Online</em>.
</li><li> The Imaginary Numbers in <em>3</em> also count. The Imaginary Numbers are a group of genetically-engineered humans with above-average intellect and exceptional abilities in combat, such as their reaction time and tactical knowledge. The Imaginary Numbers, while deemed superior to their predecessor the Real Numbers, were far less stable mentally and thus vulnerable to becoming insane under certain conditions.

In addition, he slowly loses life to the darkness (unlike the above, this will be fatal eventually), which can be replenished by absorbing Sands of Time.

The Steel Talon subfaction has two of these. The first is the Railgun Accelerator support power. It increases the rate of fire of a unit that has a railgun, but they take damage when it's first cast on them. Not too big of an issue because the Steel Talons can easily repair their vehicles. The second is the Adaptive Armor support power. It makes a vehicle more durable and grants it immunity to EMP weapons (very good for an epic unit because EMP weapons are of the main counters to them), but lowers their rate of fire. This can be countered with the Railgun Accelerator if the unit uses railguns. One common strategy is to draw enemy fire to a railgun-equipped unit and then use both powers on the same unit.

<ul><li> Similarly, Dauntless, a super-hero imbued by her, must detransform periodically or his enhanced nervous system will cause him to overload on sensory input.

Downside? Putting that much stress on his mind will (and does) cause brain damage.

<ul><li> Anabolic steroids are well known for their ability to make us stronger, etc. The downside is that there are a HUGE amount of side effects, not the least of which are heart problems, cancers, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">roid rages</a>," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJayWalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJayWalking">and man-boobs</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Sometimes</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Not all anabolic steroids and analogues are that dangerous when taken in controlled amounts to help with recovery after surgery (assuming they're pure, and illegally-obtained drugs often aren't). Others are suffering in liquid form, inviting the physiological side affects mentioned above and others, as well as significantly increasing the risk of manifestation of psychological disorders in those with pre-existing conditions.
</li></ul></li><li> The body uses another steroid, cortisone, to reduce inflammation and pain, which it does by suppressing the immune system. It is primarily released during periods of stress, which accounts for consequent illnesses. And any pain inhibitor in general is risky, as pain normally prevents someone from causing injury to themselves.
<ul><li> This is likely the cause of what most students experience in the form of the post-finals flu.
</li><li> Synthetic forms of cortisone, including asthma inhalers and cortisol, are used to treat a variety of diseases and symptoms, allowing those with conditions to live mostly normal lives...except for the increased risk of sickness.
</li></ul></li><li> The vast majority of psychostimulants leave the user in a "smoking ruin" state by the time they wear off, mostly due to straight metabolical overload, so the more performance enhancement given, the more damage caused (<em>usually</em> not permanent). Exclusions (like the Eleutherococcus group) work by rising power throughout and are more adaptogenic with useful side-effects than stimulating.
</li><li> Adrenaline. The body's own flight-or-fight system normally doesn't pump enough of it to harm you. However, combine it with certain heart conditions and you will not survive. Also, <em>external</em> doses of adrenaline are not so limited and can cause your heart rate to skyrocket, or even a myocardial infarction (in layman's terms, a heart attack). And this isn't even getting into adrenal disorders like Adrenaline Overload (as some doctors call it), which is basically the flight-or-fight system activating randomly and not turning off for a while.
<ul><li> Adrenaline's pain killing properties and its "tunneling" of sensory perception can also lead to people injuring themselves much more often then usual. This is considered "worth the risk" from an evolutionary standpoint, as whatever damage it does is better than failing in a life or death situation; unfortunately, seeing that the conscious mind cannot control the flow of adrenaline, people often enter this mode when it is completely inappropriate for the situation, with potentially harmful results<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yllw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yllw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yllw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There exists research that suggests that the "flight-or-fight" response itself is not suited for modern living, with stressors that don't require such a response still prompting it. For example, financial anxiety can and frequent does provoke a "flight-or-fight" response, which is completely inappropriate to the threat, and can lead to insomnia, heart palpitations, even more anxiety, and much, much worse</span>.
</li><li> Also, increased strength from adrenaline rushes (like a mother lifting a car off her child) is capable of causing serious damage to the body. The muscles, tendons, and ligaments aren't built to take a beating like that on a regular basis, which is the main reason your body only allows superhuman feats of strength under the most absolutely necessary conditions. The human body generally does not operate at absolute peak performance specifically because of the biological "limiters" that are only deactivated in extreme situations.
</li><li> The limiters can be turned off manually, without the need for an adrenaline rush, but it requires specific training to do so. Thankfully, the trainingthis trooper received came with a skill for understanding the body's risk for damage internally as a means of knowing when to limit activity. An example is this trooper when arm wrestling his one friend who had significantly higher strength. As the friend began to push down, this trooper willed himself to match his strength, but turned it off as he actually felt his ulna starting to flex and bend rather sharply and was able to stop in time so as not to have his arm snap like a twig. In terms of general exertion, the most this troper faced was elevating his heart rate to 240 for about 90 seconds, rendering him temporarily blind and unable to stand until his heart calmed down. Actual adrenaline rushes had a reduced effect (given he was already overclocking his body).
</li></ul></li><li> In short, most of the above substances work a bit like taking out a loan from a loan shark. It gets you what you need, when you desperately need it, but the terms of repayment are <em>absolutely awful</em>.
