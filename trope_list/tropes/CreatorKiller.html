A year after filing for bankruptcy, 4Kids reincorporated itself as 4Licensing Corporation, sold most of their licenses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanBrands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanBrands">Saban Brands</a>, and their production facilities to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>. 4Licensing eventually closed up shop in February 2017 after filing for bankruptcy yet again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmsCorporation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArmsCorporation">Arms Corporation</a> was already suffering financial troubles with the declining popularity of fanservice anime. But after the commercial underperformance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyrieDriveMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyrieDriveMermaid">Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">Stillborn Franchise</a> of the<em> Valkyrie Drive</em> series, Arms was reduced to mostly support staff work before filing for bankruptcy in 2020.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain">Bee Train</a> hadn't done any work since 2012 after its last work, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HyougeMono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HyougeMono">Hyouge Mono</a></em>, suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> from the mangaka. There's no official statement yet but it appears to have been quietly shut down as a result of several factors, including the founder Koichi Mashimo's apparent retirement from the industry in the same year and a shortage of major hit productions since Bee Train's split with Production I.G in 2007. Many of the studio's old staff seem to have moved over to the recently independent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CStation">C-Station</a>.
</li><li> Despite being a successful anime licensor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a> laid off several of its employees in 2006 due to financial problems resulting from the Musicland group going bankrupt that year. CPM eventually closed its doors in April 2009 after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">Blood-C</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a>'s first and (probably last) original anime work after the low BD/DVD sales and the mixed-to-negative reception of the show. A movie, <em>Blood-C: The Last Dark</em>, tried to undo some of the damage, but was still weighed down with the same flaws as the TV series and bombed at the Japanese box office (though its BD sales were still moderately good). This led CLAMP to move their studio to Kyoto and return to some of their previous manga works (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">xxxHolic</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>) and putting some of their newer ones (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrugAndDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrugAndDrop">Drug &amp; Drop</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7">Gate7</a></em>) on hold. When <em>Tsubasa World Chronicle</em> finished publication in 2016 with only two volumes, CLAMP released a sequel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> which also has an anime in 2018. Fortunately, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakuraClearCard">Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card</a></em> brought back what fans had been hoping for.
</li><li> Crash Media Group was launched in 1997 with the intention of releasing DVDs. They would go on to license and release over 200 live-action films. Forming an alliance with the animation studio Abrams Gentile Entertainment, Crash Media would license animated titles. Kimio Ikeda proposed a concept of a car-racing anime called <em>Shiden</em>, but despite making a pilot episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Ikeda died before a full series could be produced</a>. In 2004, Crash Media snapped up the license to the first 13 episodes of the anime series <em>Geisters - Fractions of the Earth</em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a> distributing. Unfortunately, the show was met with a mixed response, Crash's licensor to the series was shut down, and Crash Media left the anime industry. Crash shut down for good in 2007 after a lawsuit regarding their release of the Samurai Trilogy films starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> without Criterion's knowledge, unsuccessful distribution deals with Koch Distribution and Inspired Corporation, as well as low sales.
</li><li> Animation subcontractor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamaProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamaProductions">drop</a> shut its doors in late 2018 between the failure of an original anime, <em>Lights of the Clione</em>, rising production costs, and their inability to acquire more contracts for other outside productions.
</li><li> As an in-universe example: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako">Shirobako</a></em>, director Seiichi Kinoshita of the fictitious series <em>Exodus</em> is thrilled to have any work at all after the complete and abject failure of his last show, an adaptation that went over-budget, devolved into a fanservice-y mess, and enraged the parent manga's fanbase by completely botching its story, to the point where he got absolutely no work for years on end.

</li><li> <em>Ultimate Girls</em> was the last anime ever produced by Masters of Entertainment, a Pony Canyon label.

Even worse, <em>HaCha</em> was the <em>second straight season</em> to suffer such a fate, and Toei apparently didn't want to take any more chances with Shibata after his mismanagement resulted in two consecutive seasons becoming train wrecks.
</li><li> <em>Crimson Wolf</em> was this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a>. It was so bad not even Fred Patten, an animation historian and Streamline's longest-serving employee, had anything nice to say about it in his chronicle of the company on his blog, and yet they had to license it in order to get a more attractive title founder Carl Macek wanted. Good luck trying to convince any hardcore fan of the company that <em>Crimson Wolf</em> had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the distributor problems that kicked in a few months after its release in April 1995 and ultimately finished off the company in 1997 (not helping matters was that the distributor in question, Orion Pictures, was dealing with its own crippling issues). As for Macek, he continued his career as an ADR director, actor, producer and scriptwriter before his fatal heart attack in 2010.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fractale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fractale">Fractale</a></em> was conceived as a way for its director, Yutaka "Yamakan" Yamamoto, to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a> regret firing him, with all the resources put into it that you'd expect with a goal like that. He was so sure of its success that he said he'd step down if it did poorly. The end result was said to be good, if not great, by most people who watched it to the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">but not many people did.</a> Yamakan probably would have had to step down even if he hadn't explicitly staked his career on it doing well.
<ul><li> The main problem was the competition; <em>Fractale</em> was billed as the "moe-killer" series by the director himself, and as if to prove this it was released at the same time as a cutesy-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> show. Unfortunately for <em>Fractale</em> that show was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, which was not only <em>the</em> anime for the Winter 2011 season, but also one of the most popular anime of the entire decade.
</li><li> It also garnered some of the worst ratings for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noitamina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noitamina">noitaminA</a> animation block. Although the 2011 Sendai Earthquake didn't help matters, the show's ratings prior to the earthquake were noticeably behind the average ratings for all other series in the block.

<ul><li> The infamous crossover <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathmate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathmate">Deathmate</a></em> is often accused of killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics">Valiant Comics</a>. The other side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a>, did recover from it.
</li><li> After the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">Clone Saga</a>, it was decided that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> titles were to be canceled and relaunched with new "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">number ones</a>" alongside a miniseries written and drawn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a> that would retell Spider-Man's origin. This reboot was notable in that one writer - Howard Mackie - would be looking after both titles. The reboot was heavily promoted and garnered much anticipation among fans and critics, with Mackie claiming that they would "fix" the books and make things "fun" again. But things soured after the reboot where Mackie had Spider-Man face off against lackluster villains, engage in weird plots like facing off against vampires, supernatural villains, an alien-infested senator who was set up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of his arc, and - most notably - "killed" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a>. Fan and critical reaction was sour, and soon Mackie's plans were outright scuttled - he was replaced on one of the books by Paul Jenkins and was given just enough time to wrap up his run and bring back Mary Jane before he was pulled from the title and replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>. Mackie's career never recovered from the debacle. In the decade since then, Mackie rarely worked in comics with his last work being a six-issue mini-series that was to serve as a "reinterpretation" of what was to actually have happened in the initial Clone Saga alongside Tom Defalco.
<ul><li> The Clone Saga itself also nearly killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> as a whole, making it another example. There were <em>many</em> organizational problems with Marvel at the time, which was one reason the Clone Saga ran overlong and ended up being such a badly-regarded story. While the series itself sold very well at the time, the damage to the corporate culture was long-lasting and can still be felt today. These are partially documented in the web series <em>Life of Reilly</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Chuck Austen is, apart from <em>maybe</em> his earlier works, one of the most hated writers in comics, owing mostly to poor characterization and story-telling, along with his attitude towards any criticisms. But it wasn't until his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> run that his career as a writer really died. After he was kicked out of Marvel by irritated fans, DC hired Austen to write Superman but he was fired shortly afterward and blacklisted from comics after his short run had a Superman-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> love triangle based on Austen's hatred of Lois Lane. That he openly insulted the decades-old beloved character to the media didn't help. He hasn't done anything worth mentioning since.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMenForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMenForever">X-Men Forever</a></em> destroyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>'s once-legendary career in comics.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a>'s stories have always had detractors, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum">Ultimatum</a></em> is the series that truly hurt his career, due to all kinds of research failure, in addition to gratuitous violence and tons of death. While he sort of recovered with the decent <em>Captain America: Fallen Son</em> and <em>Nova</em>, the fact that he ruined the Ultimate line means he doesn't get much work writing comics anymore. Loeb is still in charge of the television and animation division of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, however, where he has had much better success.
</li><li> Karl Bollers is most famous for his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received and is pretty much the reason why he hasn't done much else.
<ul><li> Likewise with Ken Penders, who eventually sued Archie for the rights to his characters, causing a reboot of the comics (and likely causing the license to move to IDW not long after). He was utterly blacklisted in the industry for this stunt, drew the ire of fans who thought what he did was utterly petty, and hasn't written anything major since. He has tried to do his own comic based on the characters he acquired, but its considered a laughing stock in the comics and Sonic fandoms alike, and still hasnt been released in any capacity.
</li></ul></li><li> Ardian Syaf was an up-and-coming artist who was chosen as one of three rotating artists for Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMenGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMenGold">X-Men: Gold</a></em>. However, he was hit with <em>massive</em> controversy when <em>X-Men: Gold</em> #1 was released and it was revealed he snuck in various references to political and religious topics, which could actually be translated as Anti-Christian and Anti-Jewish. Both fans and other creators got angry over this, and Syaf himself proclaimed that his career was over. Marvel fired him the next day.
</li><li> The controversial <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LostGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LostGirls">Lost Girls</a></em> miniseries may not have damaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s career too badly, but it did bring an end to the career of his collaborator (and now wife) Melinda Gebbie. It didn't help that she relocated to England, where several of her works (including <em>Lost Girls</em>) were deemed obscene.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> is effectively a shell of its former self. Once boasting one of the few long-running titles, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> doing reboots every time they turned around (Marvel more than DC), Archie now only has one title with double digits and a handful of others with single digits that appear infrequently. What happened? First came the painful lawsuits involving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, which saw the title being forced into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> (though it didn't lose its numbering). Soon after was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Unite</a></em>, which Archie attempted to raise flagging sales on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> and tried it by buying up rights to other SEGA and Capcom franchises — doing so cost millions and the story barely recouped the money. Then came "Riverdale Reborn", which saw all of the Archie titles being canceled and given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> of their own, forcing them into a failed Kickstarter attempt. Then, they focused on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em>, which proved good, but not the big hit Archie hoped for. Most of their titles are on "hiatuses" and the license to make <em>Sonic</em> comics is now in the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IDWPublishing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IDWPublishing">IDW Publishing</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GetKraven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GetKraven">Get Kraven</a></em> brought an abrupt end to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonZimmerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonZimmerman">Ron Zimmerman</a>'s career as a comic-book writer, failing so badly that Marvel canceled it before its final issue was released. He's since gone back to writing and producing for TV.

(RCA also deliberately avoided magnetic tape until they were basically forced to, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">they believed it would never be cheap enough for home use.</a>) All of this meant it was delayed until spring of <em><strong>1981</strong></em> — well into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VCR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VCR">VCR</a> era, and long after Philips' and MCA's competing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> system was introduced. While the format did have some advantages at the time<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3nqel');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3nqel" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3nqel');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">SelectaVision movies were significantly cheaper to buy than movies on videocassette or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, and since RCA massively overproduced them, SelectaVision discs are still relatively easy to find in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties">The New '20s</a>, decades after the format was discontinued</span>, and a factory-fresh disc with a good needle compared quite favorably with LaserDisc, the format had massive durability issues; video quality on repeated plays was plagued with skipping and dropouts, degrading into an unwatchable mess after only a few hundred plays (RCA rated the discs at around 500 plays). More importantly, it didn't offer the recording capability of VHS/Beta; while the discs were cheap to buy, people were still far more interested at the time in recording things they could see for free on TV and watching them later, and video rental was still several years away — and unlike VHS or Beta, SelectaVision was a purchase-only format controlled entirely by RCA, meaning that some content was simply not available. After all of the delays and the massive amount of R&amp;D put into it, RCA needed SelectaVision to be a hit, but the format failed to take off, resulting in RCA finally killing the project in 1984, and its subsequent acquisition and breakup by its former parent General Electric. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TechnologyConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TechnologyConnections">Technology Connections</a> produced a 5-part series about the format's infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnpX8d8zRIA&amp;list=PLv0jwu7G_DFVP0SGNlBiBtFVkV5LZ7SOU">starts here,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Techmoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Techmoan">Techmoan</a> also covered <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LrPe0rwXOU">the format here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> During the '80s and '90s, The Sharper Image was a modestly popular electronics company specializing in appliances such as jogging watches. However, the company had its "big break" during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, when they created an air purifier called the Ionic Breeze. The purifier became a huge success, thanks to its compact size and the fact that it didn't require frequent filter changes. However, what was believed to be the product that would make them into a household name instead turned out to be what killed them. In 2003, <em>Consumer Reports</em> published a negative review of the Ionic Breeze, saying that it essentially didn't work as advertised. This resulted in The Sharper Image suing them for unfair testing practices — a suit that was thrown out of court when they were to unable to actually demonstrate that <em>CR</em>'s claims were in any way incorrect, damning the Ionic Breeze and vindicating <em>CR</em>'s review. The Ionic Breeze's fate was sealed in 2005, when <em>CR</em> published an article declaring it a potential health hazard thanks to the large amounts of ozone it had produced, causing sales to plummet. The Sharper Image quickly dissolved, eventually filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2008. Today, the company exists strictly as a minor subsidiary of several larger corporations.
</li><li> Like The Sharper Image, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys">LJN</a>'s "breakthrough" product ended up being their death knell instead. After impressive licensing deals that brought toys based off properties such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">ThunderCats (1985)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em>, LJN used their newfound fame to create a line of water guns called "Entertech". The toys were revolutionary on the fact that they could fire water like an automatic firearm, and even have its water supply come from detachable magazines. Add that to their almost completely realistic look to a real firearm, and it seemed that the brand would turn LJN into a major toy competitor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro">Hasbro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel">Mattel</a>. That dream was never realized, however, as on the peak of Entertech's popularity, it became the center of massive media attention after several high-profile incidents of children playing with the water guns getting shot and killed by police officers who were unable to distinguish the toys with the real thing. Even more shocking were that the toy guns had been commonly used in robberies at banks and retailers. As a result of the controversy surrounding Entertech, LJN's then-parent company MCA sold the toy manufacturer in 1990 to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Acclaim">Acclaim</a>. Acclaim then shut down LJN's toy division in 1990 to focus more on its video game division (see the "Video Games" section for more).

They had originally started this project with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington but eventually broke off and did the tablet themselves, incurring a lawsuit from Arrington in the process. When the tablet hit store shelves, its ungainly size and weight compared to the coming iPad, along with battery-life issues and poor lag, ended up making the tablet a failure and unplugged Fusion Garage's business within two years, owing creditors $40 million.
</li><li> The Sinclair brand of affordable consumer electronics, most famous for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, was felled as an independent entity by the combined failures of the <a class="urllink" href="http://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/vehicles/c5.htm">Sinclair C5,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an early attempt at an electric vehicle that underperformed against an ordinary bicycle; and the <a class="urllink" href="http://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/televisions/tv80.htm">TV80,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an expensive-to-build attempt at a portable television with an incredibly narrow viewing angle and a specialised CRT that would soon be obsoleted by LCD technology. Without <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enterprise_Board">the NEB<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to save them (as when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Sinclair Black Watch</a> flopped just as miserably), Sinclair Research was forced to sell the Sinclair brand and the computer products that bore it to their rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC">Amstrad</a> just to stay afloat. The company is still around today but exists primarily as a means through which founder Clive Sinclair markets his inventions.
</li><li> Most American manufacturers of analog synthesizers that were around in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> shut down because they couldn't keep up with the technological advancement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Moog died trying to keep up: The six-voice flagship polysynth Memorymoog came too late (the target audience already had Jupiters, Oberheims etc.), it was quite unreliable at first, even adding MIDI didn't save it, and Moog failed to earn back the money it cost to develop it (also because they were dumb enough to discontinue the Minimoog in 1981). The Memorymoog required a third-party upgrade to become somewhat reliable. Oberheim and Sequential Circuits were pretty much killed off by digital synths that suddenly came from Japan. At least E-mu was in the right place at the right time with the Emulator, the first halfway affordable sampler for those musicians and producers who couldn't afford Fairlights, and introduced their first Proteus ROMpler the same year as the Korg M1. <br/>ARP Instruments, on the other hand, succumbed to the consequences of trying to be ahead of everyone else and explore a new market at the same time by offering a synthesizer for guitarists. In 1974, the development of a monstrous polyphonic multi-section synthesizer named Centaur VI commenced. It bound all of ARP's engineers and ate up pretty much the company's entire budget for a whole of two years during which ARP was unable to come up with anything new. At the end, they had two prototypes of a synth that would have been way too expensive even if mass-produced. Not only that, it would have been the first guitar synth, but the pickup failed to separate the signals from the six strings cleanly. Two years of development for nothing. Mind you, ARP was so far ahead of its time that they could have had a normal polysynth with patch memory ready for production in 1976, even before the Yamaha CS-80. ARP never fully recovered from this, also due to a few more bad decisions. By the end of the decade, they started developing a normal polysynth named Chroma to keep up with the likes of the CS-80 and the Prophet-5, but in 1981, when they were done, they didn't have any money anymore to build it and ceased their operations. The Chroma was eventually produced under the Rhodes flag.

Thus, it not only destroyed the careers of the people who created it but ended an era that produced many of the best films in history.
<ul><li> Cimino's directing career didn't immediately end after that, but all of his post-<em>Heaven's Gate</em> outings were commercial failures. He had a chance of recovery, however, as not long after <em>Heaven's Gate</em> Cimino was offered a chance to direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose">Footloose</a></em> of all films, under the condition that he won't exceed the budget and schedule by a single day or dollar. However, his primadonna behavior started again during pre-production, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">and when weeks before the shooting was scheduled to begin, he demanded to delay it until he rewrites the script and to get $250,000 for it</a>; Paramount quickly replaced him. Cimino's final film was 1996's <em>Sunchaser</em>; its failure to get a wide theatrical release due to poor test screenings made him stop working on any more projects, as he died twenty years later.

<ul><li> The failure to get the film out in any reasonable amount of time helped bring down Ron Miller's regime at Disney, and its financial failure ensured that he would never work in Hollywood again. He did have success in the wine industry in later years.
</li><li> Co-directors Ted Berman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardRich">Richard Rich</a> and producer Joe Hale were also fired from Disney in the wake of the film's release; Berman and Hale never worked in animation again.
</li><li> Rich's next studio, Rich Animation Studios, got hit with this <em>twice.</em> After their first feature film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess">The Swan Princess</a></em> flopped (though it spawned a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> franchise), the animation studio disappeared from cinema for a few years and then tried their hand at feature film again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheKingAndI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheKingAndI">The King and I</a></em> animated adaptation in 1999. The critical and commercial failure of that film (which came complete with a "no animated versions of our works" mandate from <em>The King And I</em> copyright holder Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Estates) caused the company to be acquired by Crest Animation Studios. The newly-formed RichCrest Animation Studios then released their animated adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTrumpetOfTheSwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTrumpetOfTheSwan">The Trumpet of the Swan</a></em>, which failed to secure a wide release and was also a critical and commercial disappointment. Not until 2010 did the company (as Crest Animation Studios) return to cinemas with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlphaAndOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlphaAndOmega">Alpha and Omega</a></em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">despite negative reviews was a commercial success</a> and today is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> among young animation fans, and also ended up spawning a line of DTV sequels.

</li><li> It was very nearly the death of <em>Disney itself</em>. Thankfully, its spectacular and humiliating failure, as well as the growing amount of competition, convinced them to finally get their act together and make better movies.

Thus, not only did it bring down the career of a celebrated animator, but also helped end an era that brought out some of the greatest animated media in history. A handful of other 2D animated film flops from Bluth's rivals at Disney and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation">DreamWorks Animation</a> piled on to <em>Titan A.E.</em> and ended cinematic 2D animation until the end of the 2000's with the releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em>, and even then, the only 2D films released in theaters after those films have been <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater">The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water</a></em> in 2015, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">My Little Pony: The Movie</a></em> in 2017, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies">Teen Titans Go!

<ul><li> Before that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle">Rock-A-Doodle</a></em> sank Bluth's <em>original</em> studio.

</li><li> The failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseTheTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseTheTitanic">Raise the Titanic!</a></em> is often credited with bringing down the film career of Lew Grade, at the time one of the most respected television producers in the United Kingdom, and perhaps the world.

Grade lost control of ITC in 1982 (though he returned under PolyGram management and remained there until his death in 1998), and the only thing keeping the company profitable for the final years of its existence was its library of previous accomplishments. If that wasn't enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> cut ties with ITC after they attempted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">tampering</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em> to the point where he bought the film's rights from them (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> still handled theatrical distribution, though), and in 1984 he bought every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">Muppet</a> project ITC co-produced <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4spga');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4spga" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4spga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetMovie">The Muppet Movie</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatMuppetCaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatMuppetCaper">The Great Muppet Caper</a></em></span> back from them.

The film also managed to be a factor in Disney getting out of films made with adult audiences in mind for a decade; as a further consequence, it effectively ended the Touchstone label except to distribute DreamWorks projects, foreign films, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">films the company doesn't really care about</a> (the last in-house productions released by Touchstone were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouAgain">You Again</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepUp">Step Up 3D</a></em>, both released in 2010).
</li><li> The critical and commercial flop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrangeMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrangeMagic">Strange Magic</a></em> was enough justification on Disney's part to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TouchstonePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TouchstonePictures">Touchstone Pictures</a> the ax as the studio severed ties with DreamWorks later that year; that studio went to mend fences with Universal Pictures (which they had dumped for Disney years earlier, after the studio was spun off from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a>) and shift distribution of DW movies to them.

The films De Laurentiis produced at his studio were not box office hits (even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueVelvet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueVelvet">Blue Velvet</a></em> and the first Hannibal Lecter movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter">Manhunter</a></em>, ended up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">Acclaimed Flops</a>). Ironically, it didn't end up living long enough to see one of its projects, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em>, become a hit. His second company had a mixed track record, with films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmyOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmyOfDarkness">Army of Darkness</a></em> doing well enough to make back their budget, but not much after that. Although De Laurentiis kept producing until his death in 2010, he never had any success outside of the Hannibal movies (he apparently regretted selling the film rights to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em>)—and adding insult to injury, the last theatrically-released film he produced, the 2007 film adaptation of the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HannibalRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HannibalRising">Hannibal Rising</a></em>, was a critical and financial flop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">that ended that franchise</a> (not helped by the fact that the only reason both the book and the film existed was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">De Laurentiis wanted to make a prequel Hannibal film</a>). To show how desperate his studio was for a hit, in 1987 De Laurentiis teamed up with Glad to release the gimmicky comedy <em>Million Dollar Mystery</em>. Since the movie centered on trying to recover $4 million, they had a contest where if one of the audience members could accurately guess the whereabouts of a hidden million dollars based on clues sprinkled in and on specially marked Glad-Lock bags, he or she would get that amount of money!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69fgk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note69fgk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69fgk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In case you were wondering, the winner of said contest turned out to be a 14-year-old girl who managed to figure out that the million bucks were in the Statue of Liberty's nostrils!</span> The film was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">million dollar misery</a> at the box-office, thus it not only poured salt on De Laurentiis' studio's wound, but it also marked the end for veteran director Richard Fletcher. His late wife and the company bearing his name tried to revive the Hannibal Lecter franchise with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">cult 2013 TV series</a>, which despite critical acclaim, a rapid cult fanbase, and catapulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen">Mads Mikkelsen</a> to stardom, received low ratings and was cancelled, thus ensuring an ignominious end to the De Larentiis legacy.
</li><li> In what was possibly the most egregious vanity project of the independent scene, mortgagee Daniel Sadek conceived <em>Redline</em> as a starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">vehicle</a> for his girlfriend Nadia Björlin and his valuable cars. Along with producing and co-writing this flick, Sadek sunk in $55 million for the production and distribution both through his own companies, Quick Loan Funding (which was a subprime mortgage service) and Chicago Pictures respectably. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotScreenedForCritics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotScreenedForCritics">critics couldn't tear it to shreds in advance</a>, that embargo didn't stop <em>Redline</em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">bombing hard at the box office</a>. The disaster was so great, it not only spelled death for Chicago Pictures and fry Quick Loan, but it also took a huge financial toll on Sadek himself. He ended up bankrupt with the dubious distinction of being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor">Predator Zero in the subprime-mortgage game</a>".

Other than the release of two new films in 2010 and 2015 respectively, he largely focused on writing animation tutorials and teaching aspiring animators around the world before dying of kidney cancer in 2019.

<ul><li> Cartridge Television Inc., the first distributor of home video product through its Cartrivision system, was already having a rough time just trying to launch it, but the death knell was sounded by the mysterious and spontaneous meltdown of entire warehouses full of Cartrivision tapes printed on Fuji stock just before the 1972 holiday season. While Cartrivision did see some success on the West Coast the next year, and subsequently through hobbyists, the damage done to Cartrivision was practically irreversible after that incident, and Cartridge Television Inc. went bankrupt before the end of 1973.
</li><li> Allied Artists Video thought it would be a good idea to release <em>The Babe Ruth Story</em> early in their run. After all, they were releasing dozens of other titles simultaneously, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong">What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</a> They even placed as the film's blurb a rare positive review for the film, claiming it to be "a sports-action winner featuring the king of swat". Imagine the consumers' shock, then, when what they got was a cheap-ass B-movie cash-in on the Sultan of Swat made to capitalize on his death in 1948. One bad apple, it turns out, <em>does</em> spoil the whole damn bunch, and this painted a big red target on the back of Allied Artists Video when new owner Lorimar decided to put unprofitable assets on the chopping block in 1980.
</li><li> Intervision Video, one of the two pioneers of the British home video market (the other being VCL), looked to be heading for glory when they made a deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists">United Artists</a> to distribute 20 UA films on Betamax, VHS, and Video 2000 for rental in the fall of 1980. Then, in December 1981, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> entered an "exclusive, long-term agreement" to distribute 500 UA films on Betamax, VHS, and Video 2000 (about twice as big as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MagneticVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MagneticVideo">Magnetic Video</a>'s home video deal with UA for 250 of its films on the other side of the pond)... <em>including Intervision's 20</em>. Either Warner was oblivious to the earlier deal, or they knew about it and decided it would be in their best interests to respect that deal by leaving Intervision alone. Either way, more people ended up renting Warner's UA tapes than Intervision's UA tapes, and Intervision faded into obscurity quickly, eventually closing up shop in the mid-'80s.
</li><li> Media Home Entertainment, one of the four "mini-majors" in the home video industry covering a large library of VHS releases in many diverse genres (alongside sub-labels Hi-Tops Video releasing children's titles and Fox Hills Video releasing more special interest oriented videos), collapsed in 1990 when Gerald Ronson, the leader of its parent company Heron Communications, was convicted of securities fraud due to his role in the Guinness share-trading fraud in the UK, eventually closing shop in 1993. Most of their final releases were distributed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a> and their assets eventually went to what became Anchor Bay Entertainment by the late 90s.
</li><li> Simitar Entertainment, a media company that specialized in special interest VHS tapes covering a wide range of genres and compilation albums (as well as the first independent company to release DVDs), met an untimely demise in 1999 when Titan Sports, owner of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a>, filed a lawsuit against them for infringing copyright from <em>WWF: The Music, Volume Three</em> (which was, as the title suggests, a music album). Simitar lost the case and wound up bankrupt by the end of the year. Afterward, they were forced to sell their assets to Brentwood Communications, which was later bought by Navarre Corporation.

<ul><li> While Gloria Tesch's works were never well-received, her family self-published three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaradoniaSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaradoniaSaga">Maradonia Saga</a></em> books between 2008 and 2010, and they had planned to make more sequels — the last published book ended on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>. Then they started focusing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a>, which languished in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for a while and was finally released in 2016. It was so expensive to make that it got the Tesches evicted from their house, and they likely recouped extremely little of the money — if <em>anything at all</em> — as the film was only ever shown in one theater, which they had <em>rented out</em>. The film features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillReturnCaption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillReturnCaption">"Will Return" Caption</a>, but it seemingly didn't even get a DVD release, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">let alone a sequel</a>. Its failure seems to mark the end of the <em>Maradonia</em> series, which tainted her reputation to the point where she has evidently given up on it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7abpi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7abpi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7abpi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As of January 2020: There hasn't been a new <em>Maradonia</em> release since the film, the websites are down, the ebooks are no longer available for purchase, and the only physical copies on Amazon are used.</span> and is trying to distance herself from it. She released her next book, <em>The Secret of Moon Lake</em>, under the name Sofia Nova and described it as her debut novel, effectively disowning <em>Maradonia</em>.
</li><li> While it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">now regarded</a> as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GreatAmericanNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GreatAmericanNovel">great American novels</a>, in its time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em> was a bomb that killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville">Herman Melville</a>'s career, selling only 3,200 copies in his life. A major part of the problem was that the British version omitted the epilogue that revealed that Ishmael survived (closing the perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> of how the first-person narrator lived to tell his tale), and so the British critics rejected it — and in 1851, American critics were expected to echo the opinions of their British counterparts if they wanted to be considered sophisticated. All of his subsequent books were failures, and by 1876 all were out of print.
</li><li> Fantasy author J. Robert King was once the most prolific author for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> book line, writing no fewer than ten books between 1997 and 2003 including series prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThran">The Thran</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeStreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeStreams">Time Streams</a></em>, all three books of the climatic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvasionCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvasionCycle">Invasion Cycle</a></em>, and a smattering of anthology books. Then came the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnslaughtCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnslaughtCycle">Onslaught Cycle</a></em>, which started off decently with <em>Onslaught</em> but showed some cracks even early on (recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>, a succession of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Original Characters</a>) which continued through <em>Legions</em>. The <strong>real</strong> Creator Killer for King, however, was <em>Scourge</em>. Even if <em>Scourge</em> hadn't been plagued by a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicReliefCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicReliefCharacters">Comedic Relief Characters</a> liked by seemingly no one but King, he made the critical mistake of resurrecting penultimate series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Yawgmoth, a move that apparently wasn't vetted by everybody at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast">Wizards of the Coast</a>. King never wrote another novel for the universe again, and come the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeSpiralCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeSpiralCycle">Time Spiral Cycle</a></em> Yawgmoth's resurrection was retconned into having been a hallucination.
</li><li> A rather sad example with the notoriously-awful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyeOfArgon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEyeOfArgon">The Eye of Argon</a></em>, which was published when its author Jim Theis was seventeen. It is indeed as bad as its reputation claims, laden with spelling errors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">Purple Prose</a>, cliches, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>... which makes a lot more sense when you remember that the author was <em>seventeen</em> and had never really written anything before. It was originally published for a small 'zine, but then someone got ahold of it who found it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>, which eventually led to it being published and circulated on a fairly large scale—without Theis' knowledge, and without paying him anything. The story became infamous in fantasy and literary circles, and making fun of it is still a popular pastime at conventions and the like, but Theis revealed in an interview a couple decades later that the whole debacle had really hurt him, as he mostly just wanted to forget the whole thing ever happened, and led to him deciding to swear off writing. He died in 2002, <em>The Eye of Argon</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">being his only published work</a>.

<ul><li> Longtime producer Allan Carr was a major presence in the film industry during the '70s and '80s. His biggest success was the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease">Grease</a></em>. In 1988, Carr was given complete creative control of the 1989 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a> telecast - which meant that he promised "the most beautiful Academy Awards of all time" and replicate his successes in Broadway musicals with a production number involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White</a> and Rob Lowe performing a duet of "Proud Mary". But the attempt didn't work as well and the resulting show was cringe-inducing to watch. The Academy also used Snow White without Disney's permission and they were sued for copyright infringement. This opening show is in the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatWereTheyThinkingThe100DumbestEventsInTelevisionHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatWereTheyThinkingThe100DumbestEventsInTelevisionHistory">What Were They Thinking?

But in 1979, he created <em>3's a Crowd</em>, a lurid show that asked questions of a male contestant, then of his wife and secretary, to see which of the two knew him better. The show drew outrage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and the fallout resulted in its cancellation along with <em>Newlywed</em>, <em>Dating</em>, and <em>Gong</em> (<em>Treasure Hunt</em> had left the air in 1977; <em>Crowd</em> is in <em>What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History</em>). A Barris-produced revival of the 1960s game show <em>Camouflage</em> replaced <em>Crowd</em> at midseason, and was also canceled. For the next decade, Barris generally only mounted either syndicated revivals of <em>Newlywed</em>, <em>Dating</em>, and <em>Gong</em>, or shows that didn't make it past the pilot stage. (Notably, there was <em>Bamboozle</em> in 1986, which got hit by a lawsuit from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson">Mark Goodson</a> over its resemblance to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToTellTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToTellTheTruth">To Tell the Truth</a></em> and got it canned after the pilot stage.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesTelevision">Sony Pictures Television</a> eventually acquired the rights to his catalog while Barris moved to New York before dying of natural causes in 2017.

The backlash it got, coupled with the already-slipping ratings (due to CBS re-entering the late night game with <em>Letterman</em>; many CBS affiliates had picked up Arsenio in lieu of <em>The Pat Sajak Show</em> and CBS' other meager late-night offerings), killed Hall's career momentum. A revival of <em>The Arsenio Hall Show</em> in 2013 was a complete failure that was cancelled after its first season.

His tenure in that role wasn't well-regarded, but that didn't stop Marvel from putting him in charge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em> some years later. However, his career as showrunner didn't truly tank until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans">Inhumans</a></em>, which destroyed any chance he still had of being trusted in the role. To put it in perspective, he was fired from <em>Iron Fist</em> a mere two months <em>before</em> the premiere of <em>Inhumans</em>. <em>That</em>'s how little faith Disney had in <em>Inhumans</em>, and not just that they released the main star, Anson Mount, from his contract before the cancellation was even confirmed, nor even that they openly advertised the first and, ultimately, only season as "the complete series" from the word "go".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans">Inhumans</a></em> served as the beginning of the end for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelTelevision">Marvel Television</a>. Both it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios">Marvel Studios</a> were originally subsidiaries of Marvel Entertainment, but after Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> became too much for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinFeige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinFeige">Kevin Feige</a>, Disney would do some corporate restructuring that allowed Marvel Studios to work independently of Marvel Entertainment. However, Marvel Television remained a subsidiary of Marvel Entertainment, and the rift between the two led to the various television series having less connection to the movies.

The only pre-Feige Marvel Television production to end on its own terms was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, and even then, the fifth (and antepenultimate) season ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a> since <em>Inhumans</em> put it in danger of being cancelled.
</li><li> The controversial final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> affected the reputation of showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. Prior to the final season's release, they had been given a series order for controversial drama <em>Confederate</em> and an unnamed series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> films. After the negative reception to the final season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (although it also has won dozens of Emmy Awards, including Oustanding Drama Series, and many nominations at other awards), <em>Confederate</em> was cancelled and they abandoned <em>Star Wars</em> in favour of a contract with Netflix. At the moment they are making an adaptation of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> on Netflix, but only time will tell if they will be able to regain the trust of critics and fans with this project.
</li><li> Jean François Nebell's company Litteris Production was in trouble after <em>Sett på maken</em>, an attempt to make a Norwegian <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage">Spitting Image</a></em>, was so harshly received that it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneEpisodeWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneEpisodeWonder">One-Episode Wonder</a>. Its next release <em>Sommerfugl</em> was also very poorly received, suffered from low ratings, and was caught up in a scandal due to the poor working conditions on set. Together these two flops caused the company to go bankrupt.
</li><li> The controversial series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> damaged Craig Thomas' and Carter Bays' reputation which many viewers vowed to never watch any of their works ever again. It could explain why many people lost interest on the planned spin-off <em>How I Met Your Dad</em> which never got picked by CBS and other networks. It doesnt help that when the script of the <a class="urllink" href="https://news.avclub.com/here-s-the-pilot-script-for-cbs-failed-how-i-met-your-1798246095">pilot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was leaked online, it's very similar to the pilot episode of <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. After the show ended, both Thomas and Bays haven't been doing much asides from having a bunch of forgotten TV movies in their filmographies.

<ul><li> At the end of its fifth season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> aired what was clearly intended as its final episode. NBC, however, refused to let their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">cash cow</a> die, replacing the cast and writers entirely, and hiring the show's talent coordinator Jean Doumanian to replace Lorne Michaels as executive producer (snubbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken">Al Franken</a> after network head Fred Silverman took personal offense to Franken's "Limo for the Lame-O" piece and Harry Shearer, who didn't like how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels">Lorne Michaels</a> was running <em>SNL</em> and wanted to add more experienced comic actors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9vcna');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9vcna" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9vcna');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most of whom, like Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal, wouldn't work with Shearer until season 10</span>). While Doumanian did have a knack for getting good musical guests and treating the talent right, she was out of her depth for running a comedy show.
<ul><li> Though Doumanian claims that she was sabotaged because the mostly male higher-ups at NBC did not feel comfortable having a woman run the show, the TV special <em>Lost and Found: SNL in the 1980s</em> places the blame of the show's horrid sixth season on Doumanian because of her incompetence and inexperience. She passed up a lot of potentially funny cast members<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10sm6b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10sm6b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10sm6b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a>, John Goodman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulReubens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulReubens">Paul Reubens</a>, and Robert Townsend being just a few examples — and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> barely made it on. If not for writer Neil Levy, he too would have been rejected</span>, tried to make the sketches more dramatic, had no idea how to make the humor edgy (and when she did try, it ended up being dour, flat, and obvious in an intelligence-insulting way), brought on cast members who weren't seasoned in comedy at all<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note113ftt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note113ftt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note113ftt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">save for Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo, though Denny Dillon did have some experience in sketch comedy, as she was on a Lorne Michaels-produced Saturday morning kids' show in the late 1970s and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertGottfried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertGottfried">Gilbert Gottfried</a> did do stand-up before he was hired, but this was years before Gottfried would be known for his loud, obnoxious voice and politically incorrect humor</span>, and did nothing to improve the show's quality when the reviews tore her season apart and began to praise ABC's <em>Fridays</em> as the new sharp, satirical sketch show (until ABC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screwed the show over</a>).
</li><li> After Charles Rocket's "f-word" debacle on the Charlene Tilton-hosted episode, Doumanian was fired (along with most of her cast, except for cast members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a>, Joe Piscopo, Denny Dillon, Gail Matthius - though Dillon and Matthius would be fired later - and writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDoyleMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDoyleMurray">Brian Doyle-Murray</a>).

It earned an (dis)honorable mention in <em>What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History</em> and was one of the last straws for NBC regarding Silverman, who was fired for nearly killing the network shortly afterward.
</li><li> Doumanian resurfaced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> as the producer of a number of critically acclaimed and moderately successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> films. Two of them (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletsOverBroadway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletsOverBroadway">Bullets Over Broadway</a></em> and <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em>) even won Best Supporting Actress Oscars. Then her momentum ended in 2000 when she suddenly backed out of a movie, leaving Allen stranded, eventually resulting in both of them filing lawsuits against each other.
</li><li> The denouement of that season may have <em>literally</em> killed Charles Rocket. Before that season he was seen as an up-and-comer whose "<em>Rocket Report</em>" newscast segments made him seem like a natural successor to Chevy Chase. But after the series and his dismissal, he got only supporting roles in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumber">Dumb and Dumber</a></em> and failed TV pilots. It was enough to pay the bills, but he never became the big star he could have been, and in 2005 he was found dead in a field near his home with his throat cut, apparently a suicide.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supertrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supertrain">Supertrain</a></em>: The final destruction of NBC was <em>barely averted</em> with the flop of a series the struggling network was resting its future upon. This hour-long comedy-drama series was essentially a clone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoveBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoveBoat">The Love Boat</a></em> (trips, all-star guest casts, intertwining storylines with one a comedy, one more serious and a romantic story; etc.), except it was set aboard a train. Fans tuned in the first week and found unfunny situations and a series that all-around paled in comparison to the vastly superior <em>Love Boat</em>, and a hasty attempt to rework the series failed. <em>Supertrain</em> often finds its way onto "biggest TV flops of all time" lists. Adding to the problem was the highly-expensive model train at one point jumped the tracks and crashed on the studio floor, requiring another equally expensive replacement to be built. This earned a spot on <em>What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History</em>, and got boss Fred Silverman, who was struggling right out of the gate, in real trouble.
</li><li> <em>Cliffhangers</em>: Another series that NBC truly and earnestly believed in, so much so that it nearly canceled several legitimate hits  most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>  to put on a poorly written and produced program featuring three serial cliffhanger dramas. Each drama was 20-minutes long and ended with a cliffhanger, but only one of them reached its proper conclusion before NBC gave up.
</li><li> <strong>The 1980 Summer Olympics</strong>: By default, thanks to President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a>'s announcement that the United States would be boycotting the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow due to the Soviets' invasion of Afghanistan the previous year. The boycott cost NBC millions in desperately needed advertising revenue ... and it, along with the failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supertrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supertrain">Supertrain</a></em>, would nearly undo the United States' oldest television network and ended Silverman's career with the firm.
</li><li> Another factor in Silverman's departure from NBC was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman">The David Letterman Show</a></em>. This was his attempt to usher comedy in a daytime environment dominated by soap operas, game shows, sitcom reruns and syndicated talk fare hosted by Phil Donahue and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a>. It didn't go over well as the piss-poor ratings proved that daytime television was not yet ready for that sort of thing. Still, Silverman pressed on with it, cutting its run time from 90 minutes to 60 after a few weeks before it was mercifully canned after <em>four months</em> on the air. Silverman originally axed three modestly performing game shows to make room: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChainReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChainReaction">Chain Reaction</a></em> (which ironically recycled a music cue from the above-mentioned <em>Supertrain</em> as its theme), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers">High Rollers</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> narrowly avoided this fate as well; it escaped cancellation twice during this span and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em> had its run time cut back to make room for the spin-off soap <em>Texas</em>). All things considered, Silverman openly hated game shows, feeling that they were a waste of time and not as entertaining as scripted programming. Never mind that game shows are generally cheaper to produce than scripted programming and might have helped NBC while Silverman nearly ran the network dry (case in point, <em>Squares</em> still pulled in successful ratings at the time of its cancellation). Averted for Letterman himself, who would move onto a successful career in late-night television in 1982.
</li><li> <em>The Jay Leno Show</em> was an attempt by NBC to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno">Jay Leno</a>, who had recently retired as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowWithJayLeno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowWithJayLeno">the host of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>, with the company, as well as air a cheaper alternative to the expensive scripted dramas that, at the height of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> boom in the 2000s, were seen as aging, overpriced relics. Uniquely, it was the first show on a major US TV network to air in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime">Prime Time</a> five nights a week since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> ran marathons of its megahit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em> in 1999 — and in hindsight, perhaps they should have remembered how ABC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">oversaturation</a> of <em>Millionaire</em> killed the hype surrounding it, because <em>The Jay Leno Show</em>, taking up a third of NBC's prime time schedule, turned out to be a massive bomb that signaled the nadir of the network's 2000s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. Even worse, once <em>The Jay Leno Show</em> started circling the drain, NBC moved it to a more natural timeslot at 11:35, where <em>The Tonight Show</em> was still airing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowWithConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowWithConanOBrien">under Leno's replacement</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> — and O'Brien was not happy that his show was being bumped back. The resulting "Late Night War" between Leno and O'Brien caused the latter to quit NBC and bring his tenure hosting <em>The Tonight Show</em> to a premature end, though fortunately, he would soon bounce back with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Conan">a new show</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS">TBS</a>.
<ul><li> Behind the scenes, heads rolled at NBC after the <em>Jay Leno Show</em> fiasco. CEO Jeff Zucker was fired by Comcast (NBC's new corporate owner) in the aftermath of the Late Night War, and numerous other executives, including Marc Graboff and network chairman Jeff Gaspin, also left under their own volition.
</li><li> Leno returned to <em>The Tonight Show</em> in the aftermath of O'Brien's departure, but it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, as audiences who sympathized with O'Brien tuned in to TBS to watch his new show instead. Leno's return to <em>The Tonight Show</em>, by contrast, left both him and NBC with a lot of ill will from viewers, and for the first time in fifteen years, <em>The Tonight Show</em> slipped to second place in the ratings behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>'s late-night news program <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline">Nightline</a></em>. He would be let go in 2014 to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon">replaced by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon">Jimmy Fallon</a>, and would largely retire from television outside of guest appearances on other late-night shows, though he still works as a stand-up comedian.

<ul><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eldorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eldorado">Eldorado</a></em> was a memetically disastrous attempt by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> to create an American-style "decadent rich people" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> set in a community of ex-pats in southern Spain.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Yahoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Yahoo">Yahoo!</a> attempted to get into the streaming content game by creating Yahoo!

None of these shows brought in desired audience numbers, however, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Yahoo! didn't do much advertising beyond its own properties</a> and people who did try to watch were frustrated by the buggy proprietary media player that didn't work on some platforms.

However, Popadiuk revealed that, despite the millions of pre-order money he received, he had run out of money and couldn't continue the projects any further. Since then, Popadiuk's reputation has snowballed, and many fans (mainly those who are on the notorious Pinside Forums) refer to him as "Jflop" or "Jpoop" and are pursuing legal action against him.

Since then, customers have been fighting to sue Kulek en masse, and the company itself has adopted such names like "Shit-B".

</li><li> Subverted in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamsElectronics">Williams Electronics</a>, who exited arcade gaming after releasing the first two games in their new "Pinball 2000" platform (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RevengeFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RevengeFromMars">Revenge from Mars</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsEpisodeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsEpisodeI">Star Wars Episode I</a></em>). While many blamed the games for being a Creator Killer, the truth was that the games did moderately well, but simply fell short of being blockbusters. In actuality, Williams' shareholders had been planning to switch to the more lucrative field of casino gambling for some time and used the "Pinball 2000" titles as an excuse to do so.
<ul><li> However, the damage was most likely done a few years earlier, with 1994's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PopeyeSavesTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PopeyeSavesTheEarth">Popeye Saves the Earth</a></em>. At that point, operators were locked into a contract in which they would buy pinball machines from Williams as they arrived. This wasn't a problem for operators, as they consistently turned a profit—until <em>Popeye</em>, whose confusing layout, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">even more confusing rules</a>, bizarre use of the theme (in which Popeye would rescue endangered species, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign">drawn realistically</a>, from Bluto in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanet">Captain Planet</a></em> kind of way), and an upper playfield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">which blocked half of the view of the normal playfield</a>, caused the game to become an immediate flop. The faith operators had in pinball evaporated practically overnight when they put their <em>Popeye</em> machines on location, and Williams became a shell of its former self, never again bringing in the huge sales games it did prior. Pinball 2000 was more of a final straw.

An extreme example of an entire <em>company</em> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>.

Instead, the financial and logistical pressures of producing the weekly program, as well as the network's forcing the promotion to tone down the blood-and-guts style that made them famous, and then failing to promote or back them in any way (even going so far as to negotiate to bring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> to the network while ECW was still airing), ended up killing the promotion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gav Thorpe is largely blamed for the weaknesses of the 4th-5th edition Chaos Space Marine codex for <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> by taking the "less is more" approach a bit too far. His biggest offense was the removal of numerous unit options and items that were in previous Chaos Marine books, which largely homogenized what was once a diverse and varied army and prevented players from being able to run themed lists based off the current Chaos Legions. Fan response to the Chaos Marine codex was so negative that Thorpe was removed as a codex writer and transferred to GW's novel writing division. Even then Thorpe has not released any GW-related content at all.
</li><li> The Grey Knights codex didn't quite <em>kill</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Matt Ward's</a> career, despite the hopes of large chunks of 4chan, but it led to Ward receiving vastly greater oversight while writing the Necron codex, and since the release of the sixth edition in 2012, his sole publishing credit has been for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> Fantasy Battle</em>. Meaning it may not have stopped him writing, but despite the prevalence of rumors putting him in charge of any army whose author hasn't already been confirmed, he doesn't seem to be writing 40K anymore.
<ul><li> Warhammer Fantasy Battles fans remember Ward rather differently, as he was sent to 40k from WFB after writing the Chaos Demons codex for 7th edition... which was so incredibly broken that it forced the immediate development and release of an <em>entirely new edition of the game</em> in response.
</li></ul></li><li> Robin Cruddace was widely praised for his handling of the 5th edition Imperial Guard book, which saw a once joke-level army being turned into one of the strongest forces on the tabletop until he got his hands on the Tyranids... and promptly got labeled as a treadhead. It's widely considered by the fandom that Cruddace excels at balancing vehicle-based armies, but when given the Tyranids, the only army in the entire game to not use vehicles in any way or form, his only reaction was to make them bland and passable while ensuring that any real threats to vehicles in the codex were eliminated (the sole exception being the Hive Guards) by raising their prices or reducing their effectiveness. Combined with Matt Ward's "accomplishments" above, this has resulted in GW instead not naming any specific writer on any of their codexes since the 6th edition release of the Tyranids due to the internet backlash that ensues. Remember that Games Workshop is a firm that doesn't <strong>read</strong> internet feedback, which should give you an idea of how serious this is.
</li><li> Tom Kirby, a former CEO of the company during the 5th-late 7th edition era of 40k and the last two editions of Warhammer Fantasy and the onset of Age of Sigmar, was right up there with Ward and Cruddace in terms of hatred. He infamously declared that he did not care about competitive balance and that Warhammer was suppose to be a casual game, which many took to meaning he simply did not care about rules-writing at all. It didn't help that this was the era where the rules balance took a nose dive (including the infamous "build your army as you like" unbound approach), actually following through with a bunch of legal lawsuits, price hikes, and near-draconian "laws" on the sales of their own miniatures (to this day GW is still the only manufacturer that actually ban third-party retailers from advertising <em>their own products online</em>). How bad did it get? The fallout from this managed to cause GW to suffer a 5% annual loss <em>for several years in a row</em>. It got so bad that he eventually had to step down as CEO, with Kevin Rountree replacing him. Coincidentally this change also marked a moment where very well received products (discount sets, the return of specialist games, and the re-introduction of a lot of fan favorites and the online community) came out, so it's unclear whether Rountree managed to undo much of Kirby's mistakes, or if Kirby had implemented them but was ousted before they came to light.

</li><li> The 1967 Broadway musical <em>How Now, Dow Jones</em>, "based on an idea by Carolyn Leigh," ensured that no further musicals with Leigh as lyricist would ever reach Broadway, though her earlier lyrics for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PeterPan1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PeterPan1954">Peter Pan</a></em> and <em>Little Me</em> were highly regarded.

However, this did not work out for the better when he released the comic strip named <em>BINGO</em>, where he went into further detail about things that his haters loved to bring up.

Thiel, who had long despised Gawker for outing him as gay, eagerly supported Hogan's lawsuit, using his vast financial resources to pay for Hogan's legal team. Instead of trying to defend the clips as newsworthy, Gawker's legal defense was quite flippant, believing that their breach of Hogan's privacy was protected under the First Amendment. Instead, they were successfully sued for more money than they were worth (and even more than Hogan was originally asking for), resulting in the company filing for bankruptcy three weeks later. Gawker's founder, Nick Denton, later filed for bankruptcy himself after a judge ruled that Hogan could start seizing their assets after it was found that Denton lied about their stock value.

However, despite coming first, <em>The Rapsittie Street Kids Believe In Santa</em> pretty much killed any chance of the studio producing another major project. When it was in production, the special was planned to have a sequel and a soundtrack with songs by Whitney Houston. It also attracted a high-profile voice cast, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark Hamill</a>, Nancy Cartwright, Jodi Benson, and Paige O'Hara, and got the privilege on airing on The WB network. However, after receiving dismal ratings and being criticized for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">animation quality</a> and story, the sequel was never produced and the soundtrack was never made. The special has never re-aired on television after 2002 and hasn't been released on home video; resulting in the special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">being impossible to find</a> for the next 13 years. The next —and final— project did not have any major release, with a returning Mark Hamill being the only high profile actor the studio was able to obtain.

<ul><li> The same goes for the cast and crew, as none of them have done anything noteworthy following its cancellation, with the exception of co-creator Jesse Hernandez and theme composer NUMP. In fact, a few of them ended up quitting the TV industry to pursue other careers.

(The syndicated season did not have such requirements.) It was during this time when the writers realized the group had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">absolutely no evidence to back their research</a> as their changes for the show were either hypocritical, nonsensical, or seen as downright insulting by crew members. Needless to say, the ratings dropped afterward and Q5 was reportedly never hired again by any studio.

He spent the rest of his life as an adviser and licensing consultant for numerous media companies like Toon Farm Animation and Zen Entertainment before his death from throat cancer in 2010; which occurred while he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">attempting a comeback</a> with a proposed animated series based on the ancient Oriental Zodiac called "Z-Force".

</li><li> The critical and ratings failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SitDownShutUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SitDownShutUp">Sit Down, Shut Up</a></em> and the cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> ended up being the final two blows to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesTelevision">Sony Pictures Television</a>'s animation division, Adelaide Productions, as they wouldn't produce anything afterwards beyond the final two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> and became dormant after that. Further signifying its death was the announcement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesAnimation">Sony Pictures Animation</a>'s plans to enter the television market with their mature-oriented Alternative division, with one of the projects in its slate being a <em>Boondocks</em> reboot. Notably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvaniaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvaniaTheSeries">Hotel Transylvania: The Series</a></em> only ended up with Sony as a distributor with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a> producing the animation instead.

<span class="asscaps">Cinemas</span>
<ul><li> Regal Cinemas was forced into bankruptcy by its FunScape arcade unit, which lasted only three years in seven theatres before closing too late to prevent Regal from making a trip to the bankruptcy courts. Only after combining its assets with those of United Artists Theatres and Edwards Theatres would Regal rebound and become one of the Big Four cinema chains as Regal Entertainment Group.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Magazines</span>
</p><ul><li> From its founding in 1924 through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a>, <em>The American Mercury</em> was one of the US' premier literary magazines and conservative outlets. Unfortunately, in 1952 it was sold to Russell Maguire, owner of the Auto-Ordnance Company (makers of the famed Thompson submachine gun) — and a virulent anti-Semite. He spent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">steering</a> the <em>Mercury</em> away from the upper-class conservatism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HLMencken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HLMencken">H. L. Mencken</a> and, as <em>National Review</em> publisher William A. Rusher put it, "toward the fever swamp of anti-Semitism" and the pro-fascist far-right, including hiring future American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell as a writer. This destroyed the <em>Mercury</em>'s reputation and saw it spiral into collapse; by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, when ownership fell to a revolving door of neo-fascist groups, it was a quarterly publication with a circulation of only seven thousand people. While it kept limping along until 1981, Maguire's editorial shift ended its status as a mainstream publication long before then.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Publishers</span>
</p><ul><li> The Danish publisher Westermann produced a deluxe two-volume set of <em>Vore gamle tropekolonier</em> (Our old tropical colonies), a historical work on Danish colonial history, in 1952-53. The edition was absolutely top-notch quality for its time, but unfortunately, it was so expensive that sales were extremely disappointing, ultimately causing the publisher to go under.
</li><li> The British publisher Dorling Kindersley became massively successful in the nineties with their distinctive style of heavily-illustrated but genuinely informative popular non-fiction works. Unfortunately, in 1999 they massively over-estimated the demand for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium">Universe Compendium</a> works. Thousands of unsold books were returned by major bookstores and clogged discount remainder outlets for months, and while the company still operates to this day, they were taken over by Pearson shortly after the fiasco.
</li><li> Weinstein Books, a book publisher owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a> and Hachette Book Group, was shut down in October 2017, with all its authors and books distributed transferred to the company's main division. Hachette stated that this had everything to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">the sexual allegations against co-founder Harvey Weinstein</a> that cropped up that month.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Retail Companies</span>
</p><ul><li> Can an entire company be killed off by a commercial? If so, Just for Feet certainly fits the bill. In 1999, the fast-growing shoe retailer produced an ad for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>, which depicted hunters driving a Humvee in the African desert...who turned out to be targeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">a barefoot Kenyan runner</a>. The hunters give the runner a cup of drugged water and then put a pair of shoes on his feet while he's unconscious. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">It made their name more noticed, alright</a>; the company was <em>massively</em> criticized for the ad's racist undertones, and its failure put a giant fork in the road for their future. The next year, the company filed for bankruptcy before subsequently collapsing.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Sound Systems</span>
</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em> caused the downfall of Cinema Digital Sound during post-production. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> was initially enthusiastic about the system, but a series of failures on the test reels encoded for him caused him to change his mind, and hearing such a prominent voice in the industry disown CDS prompted everyone else to stay away in droves, ultimately dooming the first ever digital sound system before the second one, Dolby Stereo Digital, even made it to the big screen.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Websites</span>
</p><ul><li> The switch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">a new layout</a> is genuinely agreed to be what killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>'s forums in November 2016. It was derided as being a much worse clone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> that also caused over twelve years' worth of content to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">fall by the wayside</a>. Users and curious visitors left the site in droves, and the switch caused its shutdown in less than a year.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory">Some people</a> think that this was an <em>intentional</em> move to destroy the forums, since it had long been regarded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">cesspool of Internet hatred</a>, with angry anime fans going after people who liked [as]' live-action programming, and home to a bunch of trolls in general. They changed the layout into something awful so the diehard users would leave, and eventually, there would be nobody left to care about it.
