Usually, the secret they are keeping is illegal, immoral or highly embarrassing to such an extent that they would rather go to prison for the primary crime. It is usually used in crime dramas to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> out of the way and move suspicion off of the patsy.

Examples include the fact he used their entire planned heist as a distraction for <em>his</em>, his nature as a mazoku (demon), and numerous other such subjects. However, he does have limits: if he doesn't feel like revealing something, his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> "That... is a secret!" is all anyone's going to get from him. <br/><br/>This is very justified in Xellos's case, since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">feeds on negative emotions</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">gets quite a bit of pleasure out of watching the others squirm</a>.

</li><li> The manga goes on for hundreds of chapters and only near the end is it learned that the tailed beasts actually have names. The shinobi typically consider them to be nothing more than mindless monsters or weapons, so they never thought to inquire about their names, which leads to quite a bit of anger on the beast's part that none of the ninja ever bothered to ask them.

Captain Hisashi Kurokawa orders his XO to question Kaufman about it and punish him if the prisoner withheld information. Kaufman admits he knew about the plane but thought it lost. When asked why he didn't mention it before, he answers with this trope.

When talking with Darryl if Warren said where they were looking, Kyle, a human, states that Samuel had received a phone call right before they left the night they disappeared. In this case it was a matter that the werewolf's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> overlooked Kyle because he was human, Darryl didn't ask Kyle and never gave Kyle a chance to tell him when Kyle tried to bring it up.

Jill volunteers and, when asked why she didn't speak up before, replies, "You didn't ask."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress">Murder on the Orient Express</a></em>, this is the reason that the owner of the handkerchief found at the crime scene didn't admit to it; no one told her about it or asked it if it was hers. As soon as she does find out (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or at least can admit she knows about it</span>), she tells the detectives right away.
</li><li> In Lisa Goldstein's <em>Walking the Labyrinth</em>, the protagonist sees the attic and says no one ever told her about the it. Alex replies, "Callan would say that you have to know the right question to ask. Though I don't think you'll find anything very interesting there."
</li><li> In the Richard North Patterson book <em>Eyes of a Child</em>, Terri Peralta is testifying at the trial of her boyfriend Chris Paget, who is accused of murdering Terri's ex-husband Ricardo Arias. The main physical evidence against Chris is that, despite the fact that he claimed he'd never been to Ricardo's apartment, carpet fibers from the apartment were found in his house and car (which could be explained by Terri visiting Chris after dropping off her daughter with Ricardo), and his fingerprints were on Ricardo's answering machine. During her testimony, Terri explains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the answering machine used to belong to her, and she believed that Chris had touched before she gave it to Ricardo</span>. The prosecutor accuses Terri of making the story up, and wants to know if it was true, why she hadn't come forward with this evidence sooner. Terri says that it's because no one asked her or told her precisely what the evidence against Chris was; if anyone asked her about the fingerprints on the answering machine, she would have explained how they got there.

When Lessa tells him she can do it, he demands to know why she never told him - to which she rather scathingly points out that <em>he</em> never tells <em>her</em> anything, so how was she supposed to know it was important? If he had ever bothered to mention that being able to speak to all dragons was a rare gift, she would have told him sooner!

A student hearing (in a "mock trial" style) leads to the revelation that another student had done it out of romantic rivalry (not even involving Terrell).

</li><li> Just about every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> features this trope, as the patient of the week and their relatives fail to provide crucial medical details and end up being misdiagnosed.
<ul><li> In one episode, the team asks a vet so many questions that they have medical and non-medical histories going back to the patient's great-grandparents, leaving the patient with literally no excuse for not mentioning he once had an issue with nosebleeds and had his nostrils cauterized; which, of course, was the clue they needed. "Didn't ask", indeed.

John tells him that this is Lestrade's name. The annoyed Lestrade points out that Sherlock never bothered to ask through all the years they worked together. Sherlock never bothers to learn things every schoolboy knows, such as basic astronomy (like the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun). Why? Because it has no bearing on detective work. Later in the same episode he solves a case because of his encyclopedic knowledge of historical supernovas, so he might have just been messing with Watson there.

When asked why she didn't volunteer this earlier she gives this answer.

Minutes later, a friend who has been providing occasional assistance catches sight of [X] and remarks that they were at university together and [X] was already bad news then. The hero asks why, if he knew [X] was a bad lot, he didn't say so earlier and save them a lot of trouble. The friend says "You never asked", then forestalls the obvious objection by pointing out that the hero has been playing his cards so close to the chest that this is the first he even knew [X] was involved in the case.
