</p><p>The only training method that Drill Sergeant Nasty knows is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">He yells</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">He carpet bombs your ears</a>.

He tends to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOff">Sound Off</a> in drills a lot.

Often a former drill instructor who has trouble hanging up the chevrons.
</p><p>The episode will often imply that Drill Sergeant Nasty is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">right</a>: that, abrasive though he may be, everything he does is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">for your own good</a> and everyone will come out the better for it (or at least, better able to survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">Hell</a>). Of course, in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> drives one of the recruits into a mental breakdown, an outcome that you almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">never see</a> in any other examples.
</p><p>He will often address those under his command as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitifulWorms">maggots</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderedInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderedInsult">ladies</a>", or any other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot">insults he can think of</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult">motivate the people under him</a>.

</p><p>In Britain, the popular image is of the Sergeant Major, who is usually much less abusive, but no less demanding, and may or may not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsTheMeaningOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsTheMeaningOfLife">marching up and down the square</a>. If a British work has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>, this role may well be filled by the Provost Sergeant, who is in charge of base discipline, and who the drill sergeants send recruits to go and see for their punishment.

Recruits often enter with at least a passing familiarity with the trope and don't take it (or the instructor) seriously.
</p><p>This often spills into works that depict normal life in the military, more often than not, a higher ranking officer or NCO will randomly scream at the low private and punish him with push-ups or a random exercise. This tactic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lxts');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lxts" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lxts');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">known as getting smoked ("<em>beasted</em>", in British Army slang)</span> is unrealistic as most of the US Armed Forces branches have banned this practice outside basic training and the Officer/NCO themselves would get a far worse punishment for having ordered the punishment.
</p><p>A very specific example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">The Neidermeyer</a> that, unlike that trope, will seldom lead his men into actual combat, because his job is to train them, then send them on to their next assignment. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a>, the guy who leads them once Drill Sergeant Nasty is done training them.
</p><p>The Drill Sergeant Nasty is one of the best examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">Genghis Gambit</a>. It instantly provides 40 people who have nothing in common with one unifying dream, namely the sergeant's slow, painful and embarrassing death.

The reason why it's not in the Sergeant Coach section is that, in typical Sōsuke fashion, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a> and puts them through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">training regimen fit for a U.S. Navy SEAL</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></em>.

<ul><li> He later subjects a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> gang to this sort of training, so that they won't continue to be picked on by a rival gang (their training is a great deal more humane, however). Of course, his training later leads to them storming their rival gang's hideout, SWAT-team-style in Bonta-kun costumes.

<ul><li> Also, Colonello, who also wears an army outfit. It makes sense that both he and Lal Mirch would be extremely tough and strict drill sergeants, considering they hung out together ever since they were babies.

But when Teana goes too far in a mock match and puts lives at risk, Nanoha shows just why the fans call her the White Devil in a coldly spectacular, brutal style. It was all for the best, but considering her usual sweet and gentle demeanor was very unexpected and quite jarring (which perhaps was her intention). Then again, the cadets remark that even their normal training menu is exhausting.
<ul><li> Fanworks often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderizes</a> Nanoha into this trope, even extending it to her parenting methods.
</li><li> The person who comes closest to being a Drill Sergeant Nasty is Vita, she doesn't yell at the new kids (barring that one time Teana almost caused a friendly-fire incident) but isn't as gentle or warm as Nanoha or Fate. She is actually playing this trope straight because while being cold and a bit unfriendly she really does have the kids' best interest in mind all the time. This trope is even discussed by her when she discusses with Nanoha why they are not stricter with the new cadets. Nanoha's reply is that the cadets are not unskilled amateurs but capable young soldiers who want to develop their abilities and that if there is enough time to yell at them it means there is enough time to teach them a little more by beating them in the Mock Battles.

He's also been voted as the Hero most likely to be mistaken for a Villain, so he's often called to play a villain in various exercises (such as during the Provisional Hero License Exam). This is just playing to character, though, as Gang Orca is a beloved Pro Hero (one of the best) and outside of the times he has to play nasty, he's much nicer.

Nastier than most as during basic training he callously broke one recruit's arm and pinned another one's hand to a wall with a throwing knife. The reason he could get away with it is that the medics of the era are apparently capable of patching up such injuries completely without leaving so much as a scar. (The book version differs; see below.)
</li><li> Master Chief Billy Sunday, Navy Diving Instructor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenOfHonor">Men of Honor</a></em>. You may be thinking of a preacher by the same name, but that guy worked for God. He <strong>IS</strong> God! His student goes on to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a>. The racist commanding officer in the film treats Brashear like dirt simply for being black. He goes out of his way to humiliate Brashear in front of the other divers, who get a kick out of it (they're all white, and it's 1948).
</li><li> The unnamed drill sergeant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em>, who spends the entirety of his screen time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">shouting</a>. He's actually a subversion since, despite his aggressive and confrontational mannerisms, most of what he says is actually positive reinforcement.
<div class="indent"><strong>Drill Sergeant:</strong> <strong>GUUUMP!</strong> WHAT'S YOUR SOLE PURPOSE IN THIS ARMY? <br/><strong>Gump:</strong> To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant? <br/><strong>Drill Sergeant:</strong> GODDAMMIT, GUMP!

If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump! YOU ARE GONNA BE A GENERAL SOMEDAY, GUMP, NOW DISASSEMBLE YOUR WEAPON AND CONTINUE!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BiloxiBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BiloxiBlues">Biloxi Blues</a></em> makes the drill sergeant even more intimidating by sticking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken">Christopher Walken</a> in the role. He's also legitimately and dangerously insane, unlike most of the examples of this trope, who are just pretending to be a little nuts to intimidate their recruits. On "Inside the Actors Studio" Matthew Broderick said when he played the part earlier on the stage, Will Sadler the actor playing the sergeant as an R. Lee Ermey-style drill instructor, who always yelled. When they did the movie and they cast Walken, he would say his lines in a much slower and oddly cadenced manner, which was actually scarier!
</li><li> Col. Oates of Oates Military Academy in Alaska in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed">Bill &amp; Ted</a></em> movies. The central conflict of the first film is that Ted's authoritarian father will ship Ted to the Academy if he fails History, which would mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End Of The Future As We Know It</a>. Oates actually shows up in the sequel; in person, he's somewhat personable (of course, he <em>is</em> off-duty at the time), but still insanely imposing; it's when he appears as part of Bill and Ted's joint Personal Hell that we see this trope come into play:
<div class="indent"><strong>Oates:</strong> Drop and give me... infinity! <br/><strong>Ted:</strong> We're in real trouble Bill, there's no way I can do infinity pushups. <br/><strong>Bill:</strong> Maybe if he lets us do them girly style?
</div></li><li> Regimental Sergeant-Major Sandy Young in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildGeese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildGeese">The Wild Geese</a></em>, who, as he is training mercenaries, is not tied down by regulation. In the middle of a demanding training session, he kicks the medic and yells, "You screaming faggot, move it before I sew up your arsehole!"
<div class="indent"><strong>Young:</strong> On your feet, you fucking abortion! <br/><strong>Trooper:</strong> I tried, Sir, I'm dead. <br/><em>(the RSM immediately draws his sidearm and fires into the ground a few inches from the trooper's head)</em>
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> Unlike other examples, however, Young insists on going into combat with the men, despite his CO offering to pay him off.
<div class="indent"><strong>Young:</strong> Sir! With respect, you can stick the money up your arse that's all I can offer you, sir. I love what I do, I also love these grubby, thickheaded men I trained — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">you most of all</a> and I expect to be with them and with you because I'm needed.
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> Sergeant Major Basil Plumley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeWereSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeWereSoldiers">We Were Soldiers</a></em>, played by Sam Elliot. Sgt. Major Plumley didn't normally bother yelling at recruits, he kept his buttchewing to the many grades of sergeants below him, and wouldn't think twice about straightening out a young officer either. In once scene Lt. Colonel Hal Moore relates a story of the interconnectedness of a Native American group and how it strengthens the fighting men. Every older woman is termed mother, and every older man is termed grandfather with respect. After finishing this message, Sgt. Major Plumley stands up, looks the lieutenants and captains in the eyes and says, "If any one of you sons of bitches calls me Grandpa, I'll kill you."
</li><li> Staff Sergeant Bob Barnes in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon">Platoon</a></em> is initially presented as one of these. It turns out though that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">much worse</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnSergeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnSergeant">Carry On, Sergeant</a></em>: Sergeant Grimshawe is a downplayed example of this, trying calmer methods than usual in what is going to be his last squad. Corporal Copping fits the role to a T, however.
</li><li> And Sergeant-Major "Tiger" Bloomer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnEngland">Carry On England</a></em>. Bloomer, who is certainly not thrilled to discover women under his command, and does his best to ensure that the experimental mixed unit fails.
</li><li> Sergeant Major MacNutt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnUpTheKhyber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarryOnUpTheKhyber">Carry On... Up the Khyber</a></em>. He even treats a normal conversation as if he was barking out commands to his soldiers.
</li><li> Major Reisman serves this role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDirtyDozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDirtyDozen">The Dirty Dozen</a></em>, "encouraging" one of his "recruits" up a rope with a submachine gun.
</li><li> Subverted in the TV movie <em>Tribes</em>, in which disgruntled Marine DI Tom Drake continually butts heads with drafted hippie Adrian, leading both men to learn about and gain respect for their "opponent".
</li><li> The Irish sergeant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Glory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Glory">Glory</a></em>, Sgt. Major Mulcahy. Very well portrayed by John Finn. He is a racist, but a soldier more, and he doesn't want them to be killed because of unpreparedness.
</li><li> This idea was spoofed in one scene of the Woody Allen movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndDeath">Love and Death</a></em>; the movie takes place in Russia during the Napoleonic Wars, but when Woody's character Boris is forced to enlist he and his fellow recruits are trained by a black drill sergeant who fits this trope exactly.
</li><li> Sergeant L.C. Ross in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrivateBenjamin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrivateBenjamin">Private Benjamin</a></em>, both the film and subsequent TV sitcom. In both versions, he fits the "gruff black man" type, being played by gruff black actor Hal Williams and all.
</li><li> Tech Sgt. Jim Moore (Jack Webb) in <em>The D.I.</em> (1957). A noteworthy example because he makes it a point to never physically assault or swear at his troops, despite being very tough and demanding. The film was produced in response to a scandal over a training mishap where several Marine recruits died and was shown to Marine Drill Instructors to serve as an example of how they should behave.
</li><li> Perhaps the granddaddy of all film characterizations of this trope is Lon Chaney, Sr.'s Sergeant O'Hara in the silent film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellItToTheMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TellItToTheMarines">Tell It to the Marines</a></em> (1927). Beneath his tough-as-nails exterior, however, lies a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jarhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jarhead">Jarhead</a></em> features Staff Sergeant Sykes, the Marine who whips Swoff's squad into shape after he decides he wants to join a group of snipers. He's actually a very competent soldier, more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a>, but is not afraid of dishing out extremely harsh punishments, and so qualifies. A better example would be Swoff's first drill sergeant, D.I. Fitch, shown briefly at the beginning of the movie, who smashes his head into a chalkboard when he talks back.
<div class="indent"><strong>D.I. Fitch:</strong> What the fuck are you even doing here?! <br/><strong>Swoff:</strong> Sir! Because I took a wrong turn on the way to college, sir!
</div></li><li> Sgt. Waters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoldiersStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoldiersStory">A Soldier's Story</a></em> is an extra-special case, a light-skinned black sergeant in the Deep South during WWII heaping abuse on his recruits, due to his own self-hatred.
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>, Captain Von Trapp was one of these towards his children and household, because too many things such as singing and dancing reminded him of his deceased wife. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">with the help of Maria</a> and his children, he was able to get over it.

After an initial dressing down he informs the soldiers that today they will be "marching up and down the square" and keeps threateningly asking them if they have anything better to do. When any of them states that they want to go do something else, he... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">gives them permission to go off and do it</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">while still shouting at them</a>). After a few go off, he asks the remainder if they want to go to the pictures and then tells them to do so, before turning to the camera and saying "Bloody army, don't know what it's coming to!" before marching up and down the square by himself.

Also notable because his character (Sergeant Gant) is not usually a drill sergeant but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a> who has adapted to doing this job out of circumstances.

While Ender is doing push-ups, he continues to yell at him, telling Ender that he's never going to make commander and that Dap will never salute him. After Ender replies that Dap will, Dap adds 20 more push-ups (although he stops Ender after a few more). Finally, he yells for Ender to "shut it" when the boy continues to mouth off. Later, though, after Ender <em>does</em> make commander, Dap salutes him and treats him with respect.

Metzger is an overbearing crude and ignorant bully with no redeeming features; a disgruntled recruit, Schulze, gains revenge in several satisfying ways, including seducing his bored and bovine wife, passing an STD on to her in the bargain.

Ermey's character, Sgt.

His training methods are so brutal that the entire company despises him and becomes motivated to go above and beyond to prove his insults wrong. For half of the first episode, he's shown being extremely tough on his soldiers, revoking their passes for the slightest offenses, making them train longer and harder than the other companies. At one point his battalion commander tells him that his company has the finest performance in their division. However, he subverts the trope somewhat when it's discovered that he's an incompetent commander. While he's great at whipping soldiers into shape in a garrison environment and several acknowledge they would have died without his training, he's not so great when it comes to fieldwork. He's unable to perform simple tasks, such as reading a map properly, resulting in a mutiny by his NCO's who refuse to go to war under his command. Ultimately he's reassigned to a training camp to keep him out of the field, and Easy Company gets a different captain before they mobilize. The real Sobel was apparently a bitter and deeply unhappy man who attempted suicide late in life.

The real Drill Sergeant Nasty in the episode is actually Chakotay. The crewmen that Tuvok is training opt to leave mid-drill as Tuvok's logical Vulcan approach does little to enforce compliance.

<ul><li> The trope is deconstructed in multiple ways, mostly through the fact it's a well-known fact in-universe and out that the commissars don't always succeed at their job, and tend to attract a <em>lot</em> of friendly fire due to their reliance on bullying and fear tactics.

Even the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novels hang a deconstructive lampshade, with the titular protagonist noting that commissars who act this way tend to quickly die "heroic deaths" in <em>very</em> suspicious circumstances.

A Drill Sergeant in Navarro Base, Dornan will berate you if you come without Advanced Power Armor, and after you get the armor downstairs, he will assign you to guard post in the hangar. It's an endless guard post where Dornan will go around the base yelling at all the Enclave Guards, then go to the next guard and yell at him. He'll also yell at you. If you try to sneak away from your guard post, he may catch you and force you back to your guard post. Do it three times and he will attack you! This is pretty bad when you are trying to do a stealthy infiltration; luckily, you don't have to actually volunteer for the post if you don't talk to him. Also, since he <em>is</em> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Enclave</a>, feel free to unleash your fury on Mr. Post Nuclear Drill Sergeant Nasty.

Quotes don't do the delivery justice, and part of the humor is the expressions on the inductees' faces. Also, the complete contempt which with he says, "Welcome to the Brotherhood. Dismissed." The same voice actor also voices General Barnaky in the game. That voice actor? R. Lee Ermey.

Lee Ermey. In an obvious nod to him, a unique joinable one is named RL-3, or "R Lee" leetspeak.
<ul><li> The East Coast Brotherhood of Steel has Paladin Gunny, who plays with this trope. He doesn't ream out recruits directly, but the way he talks about them with the Player implies he has such a side to him.

<ul><li> Before we continue on, it should be noted that it is the <em>job</em> of drill sergeants to be this way. Why? Because it will make you remember your training, which in turn will save your life once bullets start flying. A soldier that does twenty years of service may not remember what he did all the time (especially if he never saw combat). But he will definitely remember his time in basic training if he had even a halfway-decent drill sergeant.

</li><li> The Chiefs and Petty Officers that make up the RDCs of the Navy make this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for would-be sailors without a "sergeant" in sight.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note86kww');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note86kww" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note86kww');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The various Petty Officer ranks in the Navy are equivalent to Sergeant ranks in the Army/Marines/Air Force</span> Recruit Training Command at one point had signs posted that read "Profanity is Not Quality Leadership" in every divisions compartment. These signs were (mostly) taken down since all they <em>actually</em> did was confuse the recruits.
</li><li> In Air Force Basic Military Training, the Training Instructors (not Drill Instructors, clown!) aren't allowed to use profanity. So they develop a weird alternate vocabulary that lets them get the same ideas across without actually swearing. It's fairly common to hear a TI screaming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck">"WHAT THE PISS, CLOWN?!</a> IS THAT HOW WE DO IT NOW IN THE AIR FORCE?!!"</em> Also, they aren't allowed to lay hands on the trainees, so instead they'll get as close as humanly possible without touching, in order to try and get the trainee to flinch (which would, of course, give them <em>another</em> reason to get in your face). It's not a pleasant experience having some angry dude so far in your face that you can feel the heat off his skin.
</li><li> Real life Marine Corps Drill Instructors are trained to limit their use of profanity and often use euphemisms (though ones considerably less humorous than those described for the Air Force above, "doggone" (inexplicably pronounced as "dag-on") and "nasty" are common examples). It wouldn't behoove the newest of The Few and The Proud to curse a blue streak in front of Mom on leave. The volume, incomprehensibility and generally insane effect of Marine DI's more than compensates.
</li><li> As Terry Pratchett notes in several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books, it really is the case that Welsh soldiers have an aversion to swearing. In these post-Chapel days, this is by no means universal and the ethnic peculiarity may be dying out; but Pratchett's creation of Sergeant Dai Dickins is a "Welsh" NCO who gets what he wants without swearing <em>once</em>. Although he has to invent a full lexicon of not-quite-swearwords to do it, such as <em>"You sons of motherlovers!"</em> This is not a bad portrayal of reality in Welsh regiments even today (where it is still the case that a marching platoon may elect to sing a hymn in preference to any other available military ditty).
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the training of the Gurkha regiments, as trainee Ghurkhas apparently find Drill Sergeant Nasty behavior humorous rather than intimidating, so NCOs direct the men in firm but polite method during training. After what they have to go through to even get as far as training, this is hardly surprising.
<ul><li> Non-American/British trainers tend to be loads more formal and quiet in general.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Everybody</em> in Australia either swears a blue streak or is unfazed by swearing (due to the swearing from others). Drill Sergeants get around it by being extremely calm, polite, and <em>formal</em> to recruits; if intimidation is required, shouting at the top of your voice <em>without swearing</em> two inches from a recruit's face will impress upon said recruit how important the situation is.
</li><li> A surprising non-military example: the Crazy Horse Saloon in Paris includes among its shows a routine based on the changing of the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace. To train the nude dancers in the proper moves, the Saloon hired an authentic British drill instructor, who went all Drill Sergeant Nasty on the girls during the repetitions.
</li><li> According to legend, one of the Chinese Emperors instructed a general (Sun Tzu himself according to some sources) to demonstrate his skill by teaching the imperial concubines to drill like soldiers. When the concubines didn't take the general seriously, he followed the normal Chinese boot camp procedure and killed several of them, and suddenly the concubines were performing drill with absolute precision...
</li><li> According to at least one Latin textbook, the Roman poet Horace was trained by a centurion known as "Give Me Another", because he broke so many sticks while beating recruits. If this is true it would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">make this...</a>
<ul><li> A centurion nicknamed "Old Give Me Another" also appears in the historian Tacitus's writings, as the first to be killed when the legion he was part of mutinied for better pay.
</li></ul></li><li> One possible source for this is that for many years being a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt">Redshirt</a> (as opposed to an Officer and a Gentleman) was the last job people would take, and armies were often effectively large workhouses. Drill Sergeants Nasty on this theory evolved from the need to teach vagrants and convicts how to fight.
<ul><li> Not to mention teaching all the Redshirts that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>.
</li><li> This would also help explain the reported difference in the Gurkha's. Britain is so rich, and Nepal is so poor that soldiering is a very attractive and lucrative occupation for the average Nepali, despite the fact that the entry salary for a recruit just out of training is only 2/3 of the British average income. Furthermore, it is a high-prestige one, with Gurkhas being the most feared group in the British Army outside of the SAS and possibly the moderately psychotic Parachute Regiment. Because of this, the competition makes for very effective recruits.
</li></ul></li><li> Baron von Steuben, the spiritual father of all American Drill Sergeants Nasty, was a mercenary officer advising the Continental Army. According to legend, he had an interpreter walk along with him while he conducted inspections to ensure that he had a good enough supply of English profanity.
<ul><li> Another legend has it that he didn't need an interpreter for that: he learned the curse words himself (the only words he knew in the English language).
</li></ul></li><li> For every five Drill Sergeants who deliberately play it straight, there's one who'll use positive reinforcement and encouragement. Sometimes they're dotted amongst the "knee-deep-in-your-ass" Drills, to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop">Good Cop/Bad Cop</a>. These guys are mellower because they tend to be older and/or don't expect to see combat action, whereas the Classic Drill Sergeant Nasty is younger who know there's a chance that he'll be joining the men he trained in the field, where his life may depend on their ability.
<ul><li> That's deliberate. A Senior Drill Instructor/Sergeant who leads a platoon, and company- and higher-echelon staff, are expected to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> by contrast. It is in part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop">Good Cop/Bad Cop</a>, but also because the harshness enforced by the "Kill Hats" below them is more than enough already. Also, it really wouldn't do for a recruit to have absolutely no one they're not too scared to talk to if they're having suicidal thoughts, are running a 104-degree fever, etc.
</li><li> Author and explorer Michael Asher wrote about his experiences as a recruit in the elite Parachute Regiment and a real monster of a training NCO called Corporal Jekyll, who was a paragon of the "beasting" culture of the Paras in training, where if you were lucky it stopped on the acceptable side of bullying. He notes that he only once heard a word of encouragement and praise during his training, but that was enough to raise his morale to the point where he passed out as a Para. Asher also notes that later, when accepted for special forces, training was conducted largely in a more grown-up way that credited the SAS recruits with being sensible responsible adults - the shouting and screaming was a long way in their past, although the abuse was more psychological.
</li><li> Another reason for American DSN can be that not all of them are there voluntarily, at least in the Army. Getting DA-selected (chosen by the Department of the Army) rather than choosing to become a Drill Sergeant can have a drastic influence on one's behavior in that position.
</li></ul></li><li> Rather than a nasty Drill Sergeant, how about a nasty Chief of General Staff? The Israeli Chief of General Staff (highest rank in the Israel Defence Force - and also the IDF's Commander-in-Chief.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note97aiz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note97aiz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note97aiz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Israeli President is a ceremonial figurehead</span>) Rafael Eitan was known to be very, very strict - so much that in his days, a soldier could be sent to jail for having an open button in his uniform. He was also documented chasing around a private in a military base, after the private refused to wear his beret (which all Israeli soldiers have to wear, as part of the official uniform<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10a9du');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10a9du" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10a9du');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the generally accepted practice in the IDF is that outside of ceremonies, berets are tucked under the left epaulet of the uniform <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jmgads.com/prideidf.jpg">like so<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Eitan, upon assuming command, directed, among other things, that berets were to be worn on the head, a highly unpopular decision.</span>.)
</li><li> Author and ex-soldier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>, commenting on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></em>, was appalled by American training methods and asked if British recruits would put up with that for five minutes without mutinying. He said he'd never seen such methods used on British recruits and questioned the need and legitimacy of them. MacDonald Fraser was, however, a recruit during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> where it was accepted that civilians with no normal aptitude or taste for Army life had to be turned into soldiers very quickly, with accelerated training focusing on the important things of wartime soldiering that left out the nuances of peacetime. He recalls a training sergeant whose method of waking soldiers up in the morning involved walking into the barracks, accompanied by several corporals with dustbin lids and batons, who would then make a lot of noise <em>very, very, loudly</em> punctuated by swearing, shouting, and perhaps a bucket of water in the face of the last man to get out of bed. Later on, he also recalled a Scottish variant on this shock treatment involved the pipes and drums forming up underneath a selected barracks' window at six-thirty, to raise the regiment with a full-blooded reveille. Usually, this was the junior officers' quarters... it must have worked, as MacDonald Fraser went on to fight the Japanese for a year in the Burmese jungle, reflecting nothing could ever be as bad as that, ever again.
</li><li> A technique popular with some British Drill Sergeants, especially on very rainy days, is to parade the recruits, and ask, politely: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">"Hands up, all of those who think that we should not do any training today because it is raining."</a> Those who raise their hands are forced to keep them raised for the whole exercise, with the result that rain runs down the sleeve and soaks them, and their arms get very tired and sore.
<ul><li> There are a few other British army traditions/common pranks which are employed, generally either as light hazing or occasionally punishment for unruly recruits:
</li><li> <em>The Long Stand</em> - "Atten-SHUN!" (*Private snaps to attention. Drill Sergeant walks off). This one is generally used as a punishment and a prank. Ordering a private to stand to attention, then leaving them there, can result in an annoying/gullible recruit ending up standing for hours on end, often in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather">British Weather</a>. If done as a prank, then the Sergeant will generally let them know on time. If done as punishment, the Sergeant will let the recruit sit there until he figures it out.
</li><li> <em>Fetch me the [X]</em> - "X" will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">something that does not exist</a>, such as the Tartan Paint, the Sawdust Fire Extinguisher, the Dehydrated Water, a Pack of Fallopian Tubes, or the Left-Handed Screwdriver.
</li><li> <em>Fetch me the [Y]</em> - Sometimes even more effective than the "X", the "Y" will be a piece of kit that <em>does</em> exist but that the British Army does not have (a sadly enormous category of things). Bonus points if you ask for it in ridiculous quantities: "Go to the armory and bring me five G36s", or "bring me the base EOD kit" (EOD kits aren't stored for recruits to just sign out and are so heavy that this task would require multiple trips by a very tired recruit). Bonus bonus points if it something <em>other</em> British services or Allies on the same base have, as this will usually entail the unfortunate recruit asking perplexed and irritated matelots, airmen, or, better yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Gunnery Sergeants</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht">Stabsunteroffizieren</a></em> for an item they have precious little of themselves.
<ul><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysWorking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAlwaysWorking">Not Always Working</a> gives us <a class="urllink" href="https://notalwaysright.com/an-exhaust-ing-errand/62485/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> story from Germany. Not only does the DI send two recruits for a piece of equipment that weighs over 250 lbs. (which they then carried 700 meters), he then berates them for bringing the "small" one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Fetch me the [Z]</em> - Another variant, used once you've graduated boot camp, is to order a subordinate to fetch something that sounds superficially plausible to a layman but, if you have paid sufficient attention in training, would know was entirely bogus. In this variant, the response the instructor is hoping for is for the junior enlisted man to (politely!) point out that the task is impossible to fulfill. The point of the exercise is to get people to, while still showing prompt willing obedience to orders, also use their brains to know when an order has apparently gotten garbled in transmission and needs clarification. Examples include sending an artilleryman to fetch a copy of the cannon report<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11zhsy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11zhsy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11zhsy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "report" of a cannon is the sound it makes when fired.</span>, or asking an aviation mechanic to fetch 100 feet of flight line<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12qsdv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12qsdv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12qsdv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "flight line" is where aircraft are parked.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13o07s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13o07s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13o07s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><strong>Don't</strong> ask a combat engineer to do this. The last guy who did got the actual tarmac torn out and delivered to his office</span> or a bucket of prop wash<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14taib');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14taib" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14taib');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Prop wash" is the turbulence created by the air being blown by an active propeller</span>, or asking a radioman for a can of squelch<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15y43m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15y43m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15y43m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Squelch is the circuit in a radio that filters out an adjustable level of background noise.</span>, etc, etc.
<ul><li> It should be noted that some of these things can, and do backfire on the ones issuing the Fetch Orders. Quarter Masters<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16n5ac');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16n5ac" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16n5ac');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The guys in charge of supplies for the unit.</span> are often forced to inform the young soldier that what he's looking for A: doesn't exist, and B: He's been had. But, doing this can distract the QM, and thus, delay some important work that needs to be done. When this happens, the QM will actually work with the soldier in question as a means of getting payback. In one such example, a Private at a US Army base was instructed to retrieve several barrels of Prop Wash<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note171qha');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note171qha" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note171qha');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Remember, the Army does have Helicopters </span>. The QM had seen this happen so many times he was tired of it, and when this private came to him with the request, he not only told the private the truth but then tracked down *real* Prop Wash <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18trnv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18trnv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18trnv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A solution used to clean propellers of aircraft or the rotor blades of helicopters</span>, signed out a Duce and a Half, drove for about 6 hours to a nearby Air Force Base that had some extra for their C-130s, and then drove back. Needless to say, when the Officer in question was handed the bill for the prop wash, he stopped pranking the new guys.
</li><li> "Flight line" exists as well. Likely named for this trope, it's a plastic-sheathed aluminum cable, usually formed with a loop at one end and a brass (non-sparking) snap-hook at the other. It's used to secure flight line equipment - fire extinguishers, aircraft tow bars, etc. - to posts, fences or padeyes set into the ground to keep the equipment from being blown around by the wind or prop/jet/rotor wash. It's not usually found on training bases (unless the base is for training in flight line skills).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Gas Mask Surprise</em> - A particularly cruel prank/training method is to put something unpleasant such as rotten food, chili powder, mayonnaise, or a spider into someone's respirator, then make them do CBRN drill. Another method, sometimes employed against very annoying officers (but which will entail <em>serious</em> charges if caught) is to poke a hot needle through the gas mask filter, which will cause it to let in gas when it comes to being used.
</li><li> <em>The Provo Sergeant</em> - Recruits are sent to the Provo sergeant for punishment, with the instruction, when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">politely and respectfully</a> asks why they are there, to tell him why. When he asks "well, why did you [insert transgression worthy of being sent to the Provo here] then?", the recruit is instructed by their Drill Sergeant Nasty to reply "squat on my fucking thumb Provo Sergeant" or some other equally offensive phrase. This presents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> to the recruit, as he cannot disobey a direct order, but following that order will bring the horrific fury of a Provo Sergeant upon his tender head. This became a semi-official means of justifying the Provo Sergeant imposing a bollocking and a severe physical punishment, generally heavy and/or degrading PT.
</li><li> <em>Changing of the giggle pins</em> - Needs a friend in the tank corps: Making new recruits hold a Challenger MBT's barrel up whilst the "giggle pin" is changed. The gunner and the Sergeant then sit in the turret and depress the barrel by hand whilst the poor recruits struggle, whilst the Sergeant makes dire threats about what he will do to the recruits if they don't hold the barrel up.
</li></ul></li><li> Royal Marines training teams and drill instructors tend to have a different approach to this trope. They usually speak to recruits in a way that is firm but calm and matter-of-fact. Punishments tend to be delivered in the same way. Rather than shouts of "Get on the ground you maggots and give me fifty!" recruits learn to fear the simple command "Front support place. Arms bend. Stretch. Bend. Stretch..." Rebukes and dressings-down are rarely shouted, instead they tend to be delivered with cold contempt.
</li><li> Roman Centurions played this trope very straight. One made his century run around the walls of the camp, carrying packs full of rocks, whilst he was drawn behind them in a donkey cart, whipping any stragglers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoyOfPainting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoyOfPainting">Bob Ross</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">No, really</a>. He found he wasn't comfortable with the "nasty" bit the job required back in his Air Force tenure days, and that's what led him to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> everyone knew him as.
</li><li> Instructors in the French Foreign Legion are loud, profane/obscene, and will harshly punish recruits for any sort of disobedience (one favorite is to have a recruit march laps in boots with no laces while carrying a rucksack full of rocks with the straps replaced with wires). This is because the Legion recruits people from all over the world who don't speak French and they need to quickly foster unit cohesion while making sure everyone knows exactly what's going on.
</li><li> Played horribly straight in the Imperial Japanese military, to the point where some recruits and draftees committed suicide. Given that even officers could be physically beaten by their superiors (and it started in the academies) it's no wonder that the Japanese became known for suicidal obedience to orders, and it may also have contributed to their infamous savagery during the invasion of China. Indeed, Japanese who had been to military school were notable for being on average a good few inches <em>shorter</em> than the rest of their countrymen, so brutal was the regime.
</li><li> Averted <em>and</em> played straight in the Royal Italian Army during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>: the <em>actual</em> drill sergeants avoided abuse and cussing as long as you learned how to fight fast enough, but aspiring officers posted on the front would mistreat, abuse and kill the soldiers at any chance. Unsurprisingly, the loss rate among aspiring officers was rather high during the retreat from Caporetto.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, this was part of the culture of the Argentinean Army and a cited reason for their poor performance in the Falklands war with Britain. A patrician officer class seeing itself as a higher order of creation, privileged with better accommodation and rations, shrugged off the fact the men they commanded were living in half-flooded foxholes on cold half-rations as if it were none of their concern.
</li></ul></li><li> Professionally nasty sergeants aren't a common occurrence in the Russian Army, because it only recently started to break out of the Soviet "skeleton crew of professional NCOs, a lot of ersatz NCOs made from promoted conscripts" mold. Amateurishly and often harmfully nasty sergeants, on the other hand, were a common occurrence not long ago. The real Soviet equivalent of this trope was the warrant officer (praporschik), who was often put in a drill instructor role. A stock plot in Russian humor is dialogue between a Warrant Officer Nasty and a smart-ass conscripted student. In 50% of the jokes, the praporschik gets comically medieval on the ex-student; in the other half, the student outwits the preporschik.
</li><li> In more recent years, drill instructors are no longer allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">simply shout at recruits</a> anymore. Many of them opt for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> option instead of simply shouting.
</li><li> This backfired badly when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractor">Private Military Contractors</a> were hired to train the New Iraqi Army. Unfamiliar with this trope, the Iraqi recruits responded badly to being shouted at and abused by foreign Western drill instructors.

<ul><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorPayne">Major Payne</a></em>, with a kill-happy Special Forces Major playing drill sergeant to a bunch of private military school misfits. The movie addresses the various tropes of him learning to be kind and somewhat tolerant of the limits of those under his command... without buying into them utterly and getting his class to shape up and show some discipline. He seems to have found the perfect balance by the beginning of the next semester, as shown at the end of the film when he has the respect of (and respects) the returning students, but gleefully tortures the newest kid to show up in his class, who apparently thinks being blind allows him to be a jackass to his teacher.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrWoodcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrWoodcock">Mr. Woodcock</a></em> is about what happens when one of these starts dating the mom of one of the students he used to harass in grade school.

Adding the spicy new ingredient of "homophobia" to the already-potent Drill Sergeant Nasty recipe, Schneider is a frequenter of leather bars who likes nothing better than forcing adolescent boys to do endless push-ups and run laps around the gym in the dead of night. He's eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tied up in the showers, whipped on his bare buttocks with towels, then clawed to death by Freddy Krueger</span>.

Frasier then finds out, to his horror, his girlfriend is one as well, when he sees her pushing an overweight girl to climb a rope. He spends most of the rest of the episode imagining her as his gym teacher. Eventually, he talks to her about his problem, and she admits that she can be hard sometimes but that she has the best intentions. Frasier then tells her about his gym teacher and the fact that he could never do a single push up. <em>She</em> then starts picturing <em>him</em> as the girl who couldn't climb the rope.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rainbow Dash acts like one in quite a few episodes, most notably the "May the Best Pet Win" episode and combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. While she does have a commanding voice and shoves Tank to the side, she doesn't want to put the pets through any serious danger and eventually comes around.
</li><li> She also has shades of one when training the pegasi in "Hurricane Fluttershy", complete with the same whistle and cap she wore in "May the Best Pet Win" but she's a lot more lenient here. Particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Fluttershy</a>, though she does chastise Thunderlane for trying to get out of training. However, he really <em>was</em> sick and she immediately drops all plans to break the record. Her voice is also quite booming when she's trying to get Fluttershy to cheer for her. Then again, this is Rainbow Dash we're talking about.
</li><li> And then <em>again</em> in "Rainbow Falls" when helping Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps train for the Equestria Games relay. Inverted in another two episodes with Dash as a coach, however, she does not act like this at all when coaching Apple Bloom through various activities in an attempt to earn her cutie mark, though she does look quite unimpressed by Apple Bloom's "skill" in each event. Or when she's coaching the young foals of Ponyville to carry the flag in "Flight to the Finish", she's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> in this one. Maybe it's because she's good with kids.
</li><li> Averted again in the IDW Comic Friends Forever 11 where Dash is extremely relaxed amongst the kids and has to calm down supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">Child Hater</a> Spitfire. And then there's the S9 episode "Common Ground" where she's actually quite cute as a coach when teaching Quibble Pants to bring out his sporty side for Wind Sprint, his adopted daughter, to the point she is a total cute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a>.
</li><li> Shining Armor also has shades of one in "Games Ponies Play" where he's the Crystal Empire's sports coach as well as one of its rulers. Let's move, move, <em>move</em>, indeed. Might be from being the captain of the royal guards back in Canterlot.
</li><li> Rainbow Dash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">yet again</a> as well as Applejack count in the episode "Buckball Season" when they, as Applejack puts it, "get serious". Applejack pressures Pinkie saying if they lose the Apple Family will lose their honor while Rainbow Dash is yelling at Fluttershy to go faster through an obstacle course she designed like a majority of Olympic coaches would. Fortunately both Applejack and Rainbow realize their idea of getting "in the zone" is much different from Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie, who just want to have fun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> SpongeBob becomes one in "The Great Snail Race", where his training Gary for the snail Olympics is probably worse than most examples here (at least for this episode), often pushing him too hard and being an outright Jerkass to him. He does come around and apologizes for everything he did and Status Quo returns to normal.
</li><li> Sandy also counts somewhat in "Prehibernation Week", when she's trying to get as much "fun" done as quickly as possible. She's completely oblivious to how SpongeBob feels about her idea of fun, but by the end, she realizes the error of her ways and apologizes for it. She even makes SpongeBob play Extreme Jacks, which is basically collecting the jacks and catching a bowling ball <em>on your head</em>.
</li><li> In "Mrs. Puff, You're Fired", when Mrs. Puff gets fired for being unable to teach SpongeBob how to properly drive a boat, SpongeBob's new teacher, Sergeant Sam Roderick, is this. He takes his rules very seriously, such as not eating snacks in class (he even threw one student out of the classroom for eating bonbons he offered), and he makes SpongeBob crawl through the obstacle course blindfolded. Eventually, SpongeBob gets used to driving the course blindfolded, which is what leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Sergeant Roderick getting fired and Mrs. Puff getting re-hired</a>.
</li><li> "The Inmates of Summer" has as a prison warden version of Drill Sergeant Nasty when SpongeBob and Patrick accidentally get on the wrong boat, but they actually <em>enjoy</em> his treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> episode "Fat Like Me". Sandi is swimming to try to lose weight and Quinn is helping her:
<div class="indent"><strong>Quinn:</strong> Did Cleopatra rest when she was inventing mascara? Did Nefertiti rest when she was posing for statues? Did Helen of Troy rest when she was doing whatever it was she did? Beauty never rests! Now, swim, you cow, swim! <br/><strong>Sandi:</strong> What?! <br/><strong>Quinn:</strong> Sorry — Coach talk.
</div></li></ul><ul><li> Psycrow was one once in an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> cartoon. He got his students to run laps by chasing after them firing his raygun. He was fired for being too <em>nice</em>.
</li><li> Chuck tries to be one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">the Blues</a> in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngryBirdsToons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngryBirdsToons">Angry Birds Toons</a></em>, but they trick him into tying himself up so they can go back to sleep.
</li><li> Bric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> - Bric was very stern and strict, and rather a bully, in his approach to training cadets. His methods were even questioned by other instructors and Jedi Master Shaak Ti. Although it should be noted that Bric only wanted to bring out the best in the clone trainees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and due to his tactics Domino Squad ended up succeeding in the end.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonsRidersOfBerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonsRidersOfBerk">Dragons: Race to the Edge</a></em>: In "Team Astrid", Astrid becomes one when she attempts to train an auxiliary unit of dragon riders to protect Berk, in part to deal with her own feelings of guilt over not being able to protect her family's home from Dagur's recent attack on Berk. She demanded pushups for even the slightest infractions, and even had her team recite a variation of the Rifle Creed ("There are many dragons but this one is mine.") At one point, Hiccup asked her if she was setting her recruits up to fail so she would have an excuse to remain on Berk instead of joining Hiccup and the others on Dragon's Edge.
</li><li> Bluenose the Naval Tug from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TUGS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TUGS">TUGS</a></em> is this to both the Star Tugs and the Z-Stacks. In the episode, "Munitions", his obsession with military orders over common sense is what causes a fire at the loading dock that costs the lives of Big Mickey the Crane and Kraka-toa the Naval Tramper. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">attempts to have Grampus blown up</a> in the episode, "Regatta/4th of July", prompting the Star Tugs to save him.
</li><li> Bradford the Brake Van from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS20E5BradfordTheBrakeVan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS20E5BradfordTheBrakeVan">episode of the same name</a> is this mostly to the Troublesome Trucks, but he also has shown these tendencies towards the engine pulling him, causing his trains to run very late. Despite not being nice about railway safety, it is clear that he genuinely cares about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels">Mixels</a></em> has the Muncho Coach, the gym teacher of Mixopolis Middle School. He shows little faith in his students, and also doesn't handle sassing back well. He also shares a voice actor with Rokit, mentioned above.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupaStrikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupaStrikas">Supa Strikas</a> The coach of Iron Tank, one of the opposition teams
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotboy">Robotboy</a></em> has a midriff-baring PE Teacher who is very strict and looks very angry at all times. She let the kids train very hard and under heavy conditions during PE lessons. She wants them to feel the pain and become friends with the pain. She also seems to don't care about children who are disabled and let them work as hard as the abled children or let them make easy targets for Kurt during dodge-ball.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow">The Super Mario Bros Super Show!</a></em>, Mario and Luigi's instructor at the Plumbers' Academy was one of these. His name was Sergeant Kooperman, and judging from his voice, he's apparently the Earth version of Bowser.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> had this played out during an episode where after a bully, Butch Magnus, stole Riley's chain, it was revealed one of his various feats was being unfazed to one of the DIs and then sending a chair in his direction.
</li><li> One of these runs the Smile Away Reformatory in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "Phineas and Ferb Get Busted''. Unlike the common example, he is the episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and is evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VileVillainSaccharineShow">even by the show's standards</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder40');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder40" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some driving instructors tend to be that way, turning into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackseatDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackseatDriver">Backseat Drivers</a> from hell as the student gets the hang of it. When you learned driving under such conditions, you can concentrate on driving even in situations of high stress and distractions. Driving instructors were taught how to safely use vehicles which lacked a lot of modern safety features because those didn't yet exist or weren't yet common or required. Someone teaching a teenager how to drive may have first driven a car that didn't have power steering or power brakes.
</li><li> British Football (soccer) legend Sir Alex Ferguson is known for the "hairdryer treatment", which consists of yelling at useless players mere inches from their face. In the words of Jaap Stam "it might sound like a beauty salon...it really really ain't." In one infamous incident, Ferguson kicked a loose football boot right across the dressing room, in a towering rage. It hit golden boy David Beckham full in the face, causing cuts and bruising. While Beckham shrugged it off as one of those things — at least in public — he left the club soon afterwards "by mutual consent".
</li><li> Nuns in Catholic Schools are often depicted, even in modern settings, as stern no-nonsense disciplinarians armed with nothing but a 12 inch ruler and the will to break said ruler on the slightest infraction of the rules and most adult age Catholic school students will jokingly take any torture or abuse better cause nothing compares to "Sister Mary Francis in the Second Grade". It should be pointed out that in real life, this character is largely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> as a shrinking and aging sisterhood along with several church scandals and lay laws have phased out the physical abuse and teaching nuns in general (most catholic schools these days have a majority of lay teachers when compared to priests and nuns who teach). The Trope persists mostly because of this Trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsAreFunny">Nuns Are Funny</a>.
</li><li> There are multiple examples in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a>, but one of the most (in)famous is veteran <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">National Hockey League</a> coach Mike Keenan, nicknamed "Iron Mike" for his strict discipline and short fuse. NHL veteran Jeremy Roenick, one of his former players, describes him as "<a class="urllink" href="http://deadspin.com/5958837/mike-keenan-the-nhls-last-great-asshole-coach">the NHL's last great asshole coach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>''. Roenick describes playing for Keenan like "camping on the edge of a volcano", but says that it made him a better player. That said, Keenan is also known around the NHL for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">George Jetson Job Security</a>, having coached seven teams and been ignominiously fired from many of them.
</li><li> Doctors who teach in medical schools can act like this, chewing out medical students for their mistakes. Bullying in medical schools has started to be recognized as a problem, but some doctors still justify it as necessary because a doctor's mistakes can kill someone, so they'd better learn quickly through brutal honesty.
