</div></div><p>Plot Holes are those gaps in a story where things happen without a logical reason. When a Plot Hole involves something essential to a story's outcome, it can hurt the believability, for those who are bothered by such things.

</p><ul><li> Characters suddenly having knowledge that was never passed to them, or vice versa; characters not knowing something they knew last week, or something that anyone in their position must know.
</li><li> An event does not logically follow from what has gone before.
</li><li> An event occurring that other events in the work simply do not allow.
</li></ul><p><strong>Plot holes occur for several reasons:</strong>
</p><ul><li> The author really wants to write a certain scene, even if the scene makes no sense. Rather than toss the scene out, the author goes right ahead and writes it anyway.
</li><li> The author forgets what was written earlier, and unknowingly creates a scene that goes completely against something that happened earlier. Can happen rather easily with really long stories, or ones that take a long time to write.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">multi-author</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity">continuity</a>, one writer forgets (or ignores, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">rejects</a>) what another wrote.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The scene that would have filled the plot hole was cut due to time constraints or other reasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">While adapting a story to a new medium</a>, the adaption team made a wrong assumption about a future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoint">Plot Point</a> and added a detail which was later contradicted by the creator of the source material (compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">Overtook the Manga</a>). Another one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">removal of the explanation for a plot element</a> without which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot">plot</a> element doesn't make sense.

</li><li> In comedies, the plot hole may be deliberately induced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">the basis for a joke</a>, usually consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ffdm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ffdm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ffdm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> By definition, a plot hole cannot be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, but if it is used by the author in this way, then it's not a case of bad writing.</span>
</li></ul><p>Plot holes are thus contradictions in the fictional universe of a story. Even unrealistic, fantastical stories can suffer when plot holes arise, as audiences are willing to suspend disbelief as long as the story makes sense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">within its own rules and consistency</a>.

</p><p>Remember that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a>. Some stories contain plot holes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">part of their basic nature</a>. This includes many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">ludicrously comical</a> works, and everything involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>. Even when it isn't being deliberately played for laughs, the storytelling and explanations necessary to close a plot hole might serve as a distraction from the main plot; especially for more minor or obscure plot holes, it often makes more sense for a writer or director to invoke the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a> and focus on their main story rather than getting bogged down in explaining minutiae.

The Lincoln Island and Africa episodes are especially guilty of this, particularly in the characterizations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Nadia</a>, Grandis, Ayerton, Sanson, Marie, Sanson, and Hanson.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">When translated into English</a>, it was changed from a standalone series to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">sequel</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Energon</a></em> (which was later referred to as such in Japanese materials); unfortunately, this meant that several characters who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> in <em>Energon</em> were alive and well here. It was explained that the reappearance of these characters happened because the <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Unicron_Singularity">Unicron Singularity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> screwed up space and time; this led fans to jokingly refer to the Singularity as the biggest plot hole in the universe.
</li><li> The English version did fix a plot hole that was present in the original Japanese. In the English version, Cybertron spends the series hovering perilously close to the Singularity. In the Japanese version, it was sucked into the Singularity in the first episode; yet several subsequent episodes show the characters walking around on the surface.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Grimmjow's fraccions are killed off, Aizen states their deaths don't bother him because they were just Arrancar that had transformed from gillians. However, it's later confirmed by two separate sources (Grimmjow's flashback and Uryuu's assessment of Grimmjow's group) that the fraccions transformed from both gillians and adjuchas. In fact, there was only one gillian Arrancar in the group. Hollow evolution does mean that an adjuchas evolves from a gillian, but Aizen's comment related to the Arrancar transformation, not Hollow evolution.
</li><li> While in prison, Rukia comments that she's been a member of the Kuchiki family for 40 years. A flashback to Renji being made vice-captain also discusses Rukia being a member of the Kuchiki family for 40 years. Then Byakuya reveals why Rukia was adopted: his wife died 50 years ago, leaving him a request to find and adopt her sister as his own. A year after her death, he finds and immediately adopts Rukia. But an immediate adoption a year after Hisana's death would put the adoption at 49 years ago rather than 40 years ago.
</li><li> During the Zanpakuto Rebellion Arc it is clearly stated that the destruction of a zanpakuto spirit by anyone except its master will permanently destroy the zanpakuto itself. Late in the arc the brainwashing is reversed and the spirits reunite with their masters, but so are at least two zanpakutos that were supposedly destroyed permanently. This is completely ignored. It's not even given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved">handwaved</a> explanation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Yhwach's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">Auswahlen</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is eventually revealed to leave a silver blood clot in its victims that kills them, which Ryuken dug out of his wife's corpse and gave to Uryu so he could fire it at Yhwach, momentarily shutting off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">powers</a> so Ichigo could finish him off. The problem is that several victims of the Auschwalen survived while merely having their powers reduced, while others died from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrippedToTheBone">much more extraordinary</a> means than a blood clot.</span>

<ul><li> There are plot-important revelations about Raoh and Taki's family in season 2 that contradict revelations about their past — with physical evidence — in season 1.
</li><li> The scene where Mamiya revealed that she was branded as a "conquest" by Juda. This scar is instantly recognized. Even though Rei, the rival of said Juda, had seen Mamiya butt-naked twice before — hell, he even personally shredded her clothes off once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> causes the first scene of the series to become a plot hole. Guts is shown having sex with a female Apostle, who turns into her demonic Apostle form and tries to eat him, but Guts just blasts her head off with his arm cannon — but Guts is established during the Golden Age arc to have a severe dislike to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">being touched by others</a> because of the sexual assault he got as a child. This scene goes completely against the established grounded personality of the protagonist. Many people have decided that this could be a case of Miura wanting to create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening">R-Rated Opening</a> for the sake of shock and interest; Miura openly admitting in interviews that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">writes as he goes</a> and that the Golden Age arc wasn't fully created in his head when the manga began, and causing this to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>; and others going with the idea that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guts was in the grips of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">Enemy Within</a>, so not really being the one in charge of doing the act</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Naruto is said to have failed the final exams three times (and the exam at the start of the series is his fourth), but is in the same age group as others from his class (who are presumably taking it for the first time). This would mean he must have advanced through the earlier classes much faster than others (notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Sasuke</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Neji</a>) and yet he is called a failure and a dropout.
</li><li> Further, if he did repeat the classes, he must have been in the same class as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Neji</a>, Tenten, and Lee in the previous year, though they do not seem to know him much when they first meet.
</li><li> In databooks written by Kishimoto, the author of Naruto, several ages are listed for characters - for example, Anko is currently 27, Kurenai is currently 31, etc. The databooks also list other relevant ages, such as when several people were promoted to Genin or Chuunin. Kakashi is stated to have become a Chuunin at age six. In chapter 599 we see the Chuunin exams where Kakashi passes, and he's competing alongside people like Anko, Asuma, Kurenai, Ibiki, Hayate, etc. several of whom had yet to even graduate from the academy, let alone qualify for the Chuunin exams.
</li><li> When Edo Tensei was canceled Madara shows that he knows how terminate the contract with Edo Tensei. But how he can know this, if he never planned to return through Edo Tensei in the first place. And to make things worse even the original creator of this jutsu Tobirama, <strong>does not know how to do it</strong>.
</li><li> When Obito becomes the Jinchuuriki of the Ten Tails, he is unable to use Kamui due to having the Ten Tails sealed inside his body. But when Madara later became the Jinchuuriki of the Ten Tails, he can use Kamui without problems in order to teleport to Obito, without any explanation. Furthermore, he did so by ripping Obito's left eye out of Kakashi's face, even though the left eye is meant for the long-distance Kamui while the right eye still in Obito's face is used to send oneself into the Kamui dimension.
</li><li> On the topic of Obito, he somehow avoids ever losing his eyesight despite his <em>constant</em> use of his Mangekyou Sharingan. It's not until he tries using Kaguya's portals that his eyes even bleed. On that note, Kakashi had limited use of Kamui for most of Part 2 because of the strain on his stamina, but starts using it considerably more during the final arc, and it's only one throwaway line late in the arc that he ever brings up failing eyesight.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kakashi is able to use Susanoo, and not just that, he was able to use the complete and perfect version of it. To even perform and maintain a Susanoo, let alone the complete and prefect version, you need a <em>ton</em> of chakra, something which Kakashi doesn't have.</span>
</li><li> Following Sasuke's fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Deidara</a>, Deidara used a gigantic self-destruction technique. Sasuke survived the resulting city-sized explosion by summoning and mind-controlling a massive snake to shield him, when he was explicitly described as being nearly out of chakra just a few panels before. Any one of those techniques would have required a vast amount of chakra, never mind both. Sasuke managed to do all this in the time it took for the explosion to reach him. After it had already started. Just a few feet from him.

<ul><li> Features a plot hole the size of a semi in one story arc where a gunman walks down a crowded Japanese thoroughfare, calmly gunning down literally <em>hundreds</em> of innocent bystanders. This scene was very important to the continuation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot">plot</a>, but raises one significant question...<em><strong>WHERE THE HELL ARE THE POLICE!?</strong></em>
</li><li> Especially in comparison to a similar scene later in the series where the bullied Nishi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">murders</a> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">entire class</a> after they threw him out of the window.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a> explains this by Ichika secretly communicating with Cecilia to fire on his command after unleashing Yukihira Type-2 by taking advantage of the barrier nullifying ability of the Laser Blade. Cecilia being frustrated to not be able to help out, answers the call. To people who have never read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a>, it just counts as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>.
</li><li> In the very first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em> (the lion version), as the five young explorers see the Castle of Lions from their spaceship, Keith details Voltron's backstory and how the witch deceived the robot (or its pilot(s)) and split big V into five robo-lions. Two or three episodes later, when the boys finally make contact with Princess Allura and Coran, the explorers are completely surprised that Voltron cannot be summoned/activated/whatever-they-expected and have to be told <em>everything that Keith explained back in the first episode.</em>
</li><li> In the twelfth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, Nana gets past the police barricade to reach Mariko's position. She simply arrives there — no explanation given, the barricade not seen in her travels. Kouta and Lucy-as-Nyu arrive to the barricade and find every soldier and policeman knocked out/dead—this is never made clear. Bando is nearby with Kurama, but does not arrive until well after this in the next episode, so Bando's not responsible. Lucy is still Nyu, and remains this again until well after the discovery that the barricade is down. Mariko is by definition at the far opposite end of this barricade, and pulling anything like that would get her blowed up real good. This leaves Nana as the knockout/killer. Except a huge plot point is that Nana does not kill, and with the exception of disabling the vectors (invisible arms) of other Diclonius, she has never shown talent for quietly knocking people out, in either anime or manga. Therefore, no one knocked out or killed the knocked-out/dead force at the barricade.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> usually averts the trope when adapting the manga, but probably the only notable example is that it does not reveal SPK member Ill Ratt to be a spy for Mello. As a result, the audience is left without explanation as to how Mello's crew <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> obtained the SPK's true names and were thus able to kill them</span>. The <em>Rewrite 2</em> special cuts the mafia and has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mikami and Takada kill the SPK instead</span>, but in cutting the mafia and thus fixing one plot hole, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">creates another</a>: Soichiro Yagami <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> making the trade for Shinigami Eyes and his subsequent death</span> are also omitted, leaving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his absence</span> and Light's knowledge of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mello's true name</span> unexplained.
<ul><li> Arguably another notable example is all of Rem's decisions after Misa's arrest in that Misa's lifespan is always visible to Rem.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, Vash possesses a special revolver that has a hidden function of grafting to his arm and mutating it into an energy weapon of mass destruction. When Vash tries to stop Knives at the city of July, Knives exerts some control over the gun that forces Vash to destroy the city against his will. The same thing happens decades later in another city, leaving Vash emotionally devastated and fearful of causing more harm. So...why doesn't he just destroy the gun?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> has a couple. When the Wolkenritter drain Fate's linker core in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">A's</a></em>, she is temporarily rendered incapable of using magic. However, her familiar Arf, who is dependent on Fate's magic for survival, suffers no ill effects. This plot hole was compounded by another one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, as the excuse the writers came up with for sidelining Arf was that she didn't want to be a burden to Fate and so was always away from combat in her child form, which requires less mana to sustain. This makes very little sense, because by that time Fate was considerably more powerful than she had been as a child, and she was perfectly capable of supporting Arf <em>then</em>. This makes the plot hole in <em>A's</em> even worse, since when Fate was injured Arf remained in her adult form, despite the fact that it would be placing greater strain on Fate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, the three new characters, Davis, Cody, and Yolei, each get a new set of clothing whenever they appear in the Digital World. This never happened to the original eight from the previous series, and it does, in fact, confuse them. When they go to the Digital World, they're always shown keeping whatever they happened to be wearing that day... until the end of the Digimon Emperor arc, where T.K. and Kari get new outfits for summer, but the Digital World always magically puts them in their spring/fall outfits they wore at the beginning of the series. This happens to Ken, too, where he's always changed into his school uniform.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In regards to the Master Rabbit arc;
<ul><li> Goku punishes Monster Rabbit for turning Bulma into a carrot and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">two decorated mooks</a> by using his Power Pole to send them to the moon, where they must make treats for a year. Eight months later, it gets blown up by Master Roshi. However, the video games state Monster Rabbit and his cohorts got off the rock and back to Earth beforehand... which gives way to the plot hole: <em>How?!</em>
</li><li> Early in the manga, Goku grabs Master Rabbit and his henchmen, extends his staff and plunks them onto the moon with absolutely no repercussions for Goku, or for them. And yet later, in the Freeza Arc, it's made a big deal that <em>Goku can't breathe in space</em>, so if Namek exploded and he wasn't in a spaceship, he'd die. This might be justified since the manga underwent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> somewhat in the beginning, where it was mostly a comedic retelling <em>The Journey to the West</em> and when the Saiyans arrived, it began to focus a lot on martial arts, epic adventure and sci-fi.
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga and the original Japanese dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, there is a plot hole with regards to how Cell was able to survive and regenerate after he blew him self up, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing Goku, King Kai and Bubbles and destroying King Kai's planet in the process</span>. According to Cell, an organ inside his head allows him to regenerate, so long as that organ is not destroyed. Goku had previously destroyed Cell's entire upper body, head included, which should have prevented the evil Android from regenerating. This plot hole is averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>'s original English dub of the anime, where Cell states that "every cell in his body has a life of its own", and that one survived, which allowed him to regenerate.
</li><li> In relation to the "Goku can't breathe in space" rule, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Goku actually goes into space, having no trouble breathing nor does he, obviously, die when it has been established that he is supposed to die when in space.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Ginyu makes his return, stealing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Tagoma's body</a> and rejoining Frieza</span>. He tells him how he survived the destruction of Namek, but it never explains how he survived Kid Buu destroying Earth, especially since Vegeta specified that only the "good people" be resurrected. The only possible idea is that Ginyu kept his nose clean for the in-universe 14 years since arriving on Earth. However, Ginyu is still a <em>frog</em> and not technically a <em>person.</em> So it kinda is a loophole that Ginyu unwittingly exploited. But it must be noted that a quite a few people were brought back to life with that wish during the Majin Boo arc, that had not right to brough back to life. Android 8, Fangs The Vampire, Giran, etc.
</li><li> Related to that, why Android 16 never was resurrected despite Android 8 and likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Arale</a> demonstrating that purely robotic characters can be revived is never explained.
</li><li> The entirety of <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> causes a significant one regarding the character of Raditz. In the original manga, Raditz was one of the few remaining Saiyan warriors, who believed the false stories that Planet Vegeta was destroyed by a meteor, and went to Earth because he wanted to check up on his brother Goku's progress in conquering the Earth. While this works with the original story concerning Bardock's death and Goku's infancy, it causes problems when <em>Minus</em> retconned that Goku's parents had sent him away in secret well before the destruction of Planet Vegeta due to Bardock suspecting Freiza was up to no good. This raises substantial questions, such as why Bardock never told his elder son about what he suspected regarding Freiza, or why Raditz would think Goku had been sent to conquer Earth when nothing of sort indicated that was the case.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> features Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma going to Trunks' timeline using Cell's time machine. Cell doesn't come from Trunks' timeline, but instead a third one. If they used his time machine, they would have gone to his timeline, not Trunks'.
</li></ul></li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanade received Otonashi's donated heart when he died, and died some time after he did. This contradicts the previously established fact that Angel has been at the school for a long time, whereas Otonashi first arrived at the start, unless you believe the theory that people don't necessarily go to the afterlife as soon as they die.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a>,</em> at one point it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gin chose some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Strangers</a> impersonate him and the other leaders.</span> The plot hole in this is, why didn't the other dogs smell the difference? There is no way they could mimic the sent of the dogs they were pretending to be. This whole plot point seems to happen just to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> make Gin's son Weed,</span> and by extension the audience, think <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gin is dead</span> for a while, in some kind of cheap attempt to shock the audience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doubt">Doubt</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hajime using Haruka's corpse to make Yuu think Mitsuki has been killed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Judge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Judge">Judge</a></em> has a rather massive one. At the start, Hiro is tied up and thinks to himself about his surrounding and how someone knocked him out on the way from school. This creates a <em>massive</em> hole when it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hiro is one of the two people organised the entire scenario. In other words, not only did he tie himself up for no reason, but he's thinking about something that literally did not happen.</span>

While the canonicity of the movies is debatable, there has been evidence in the show to suggest they are (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonMewtwoReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonMewtwoReturns">Mewtwo Returns</a></em> being a direct sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">the first movie</a>, Ash's Aura first mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew">Lucario and the Mystery of Mew</a></em> playing a role in a few episodes and another episode having Dawn own an item she had bought in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai">The Rise Of Darkrai</a></em>), thus making the movie's status in canon questionable at best (not helped by the duality gimmick making them interchangeable).

The first movie and its prologue (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">which wasn't included in the American version</a>) clearly establishes its Mewtwo as a unique specimen — it was cloned from the DNA of a very rare (and near extinct) Pokémon, said DNA was altered in a specific way to make it even more powerful, the final result was lucky to have not died some time after being created (unlike its fellow clones), and it finally blew up the lab with all personnel and research inside, ensuring there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">no plans, prototype or backup</a>.

<ul><li> Late into the series, it is confirmed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Monokuma message from the beginning of the series is a recording</span>. This completely fails to explain why Monokuma was clearly able to respond to the charcters.
</li><li> Komaeda suddenly returns part-way through the anime, knowing everything about Junko's plan despite being overseas for the entirety of it. How he could possibly know is not even given a handwave.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brainwashing software</span> has highly inconsistent effects. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The initial effects shown are that it literally forces the victims to do things despite them still being conscious, only when Class 77-B get brainwashed it's presented as if they're not even aware of their actions (except Komaeda, for no explained reason). Then, when it shows up in the Future Arc, it's presented as a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> instead</span>.
</li><li> It is revealed near the end that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the killing game was supposed to push Mitarai into broadcasting the Hope Video</span>. <em>Nowhere</em> is it explained <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how Mitarai was supposed to even learn about the killing game, when he wasn't supposed to be a participant and the killing game wasn't being broadcast</span>.
</li><li> At the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is revealed that Kirigiri survived her poisoning with Seiko Kimura's antagonist. According to Komaeda, the antagonist was made during the killing game...only there is absolutely no window of opportunity when Kimura could have made such an antagonist</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The plot of <em>Tohyo Game</em> requires one of the main characters to be <em>tremendously</em> stupid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marina transfers into Shuusuke's class because her mother, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of the previous game, was murdered by Wakaba, Shuusuke's girlfriend and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and Marina is pursuing revenge. Only problem is...why didn't she tell the other the circumstances behind the game, or simply kill Wakaba? Even if you argue that no one would believe her (which would still be infinitely preferable to being extremely cryptic), she clearly suspected Wakaba to be the Votekeeper, and displays no hesitance towards killing. Even arguing that the program that the game functions around would kill everyone in response (unlikely, given the description given makes it sound like the Votekeeper needs to be alive for the program to work), Marina is shown to have literally no self-preservation outside of getting revenge.</span>
</li><li> It's telling that fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> made an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> out of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaving">Hand-Waving</a> such points with the phrase 'Araki Forgot'.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Phantom Blood</a></em>, a big part of the reason Dio is such a threatening antagonist is because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Vaporizing Freeze</a> ability, which nullifies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun">Hamon attacks</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">Battle Tendency</a></em>, however, the main antagonist's army is supposedly made up of fully-fledged vampires, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">Sequel Escalation</a>, but not a single one of them can use Vaporizing Freeze, so they crumble under an assault from any Hamon user. Even the part's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a>, stated to be a significantly more skilled vampire than Dio was, never uses the Freeze despite having multiple opportunities to do so, and even being able to use Dio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> from the beginning.
</li><li> An important detail in the final chapters of <em>Phantom Blood</em> is that Jonathan and Erina have no means of escaping the ship their on via boat, which thus means Erina is forced to use Dio's coffin to escape. Despite this, Dio's body <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(or rather Dio's head on Jonathan's body)</span> is pulled out of the ocean in what appears to be the exact same coffin, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jonathan died nowhere near the coffin itself</span>. The <em>Outer Heaven</em> light novel attempts to explain this by stating that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Erina took Jonathan's body with her so that she could give it a proper burial</span>, but even Dio (who's narrating) admits that that explanation has a good number of problems to it, and may just be his own biases at work.
</li><li> The absolute biggest one is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, which features a total of two scenes of villain DIO using Joseph's Stand, Hermit Purple. When we finally reach the climactic battle with DIO, he uses his own Stand, The World, and his use of the Hermit is never addressed. A non-canon light novel indicates that it was actually Jonathan Joestar's Stand, 'The Passion', and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> indicated that The World was originally intended to have the power to mimic the abilities of any stand, but this plan was changed midway through, author Hirohiko Araki having completely forgotten that he'd already alluded to it in published canon. A canon explanation for the phenomenon still doesn't exist.
</li><li> To a smaller degree, but still noticeable, the lifeforms created by Giorno Giovanna's Gold Experience in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em> are initially shown on multiple occasions to deflect any damage they take back to the attacker. After a few arcs, however, this is completely forgotten about; it's particularly noticeable after the Baby Face arc, in which Giorno learns that he can use Gold Experience to create partial duplicates of himself and his allies to heal wounds. After any significant amount of such healing, Bucciarati's Gang should become essentially immune to damage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">They do not.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Ace fights Blackbeard on Banaro Island, Ace is horrified that Blackbeard's Devil Fruit is able to negate his ability to phase through attacks with his Logia-type fruit. This contradicts the later introduction of Armament Haki, the last type of Haki to be shown in action, as well as the fact that Ace had fought people like Jimbei and Whitebeard who had been able to injure him.
</li><li> In the Thriller Bark arc, Sanji says that in the past, he'd read a book about Devil Fruits, and decided that only the Clear-Clear Fruit's powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a> was worth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">losing the ability to swim</a>. This contradicts the Baratie arc, in which Sanji was shocked to hear that Luffy wouldn't be able to swim, meaning that he hadn't heard about the Devil Fruits' weakness (or possibly Devil Fruits in general).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies">Marvel Zombies</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ms. Marvel gets killed twice. When questioned about this the writers claimed, tongue-in-cheek, that one was her identical twin sister.
</li><li> That's not the only life/death inconsistency in the series. A zombiefied Black Cat is first seen getting a hole punched in her by Iron Fist, but then an alive-and-well Black Cat appears on the Helicarrier. Luke Cage also mentions having eaten Doctor Strange, but we later see Strange is still alive. And finally, a Zombiefied Dazzler was seen the the original Ultimate Fanstastic Four event, but the prequel <em>Marvel Zombie vs. Army of Darkness</em>, we see Dazzler was bitten by Enchantress, but Doctor Doom obliterated her before she could become a zombie.
</li></ul></li><li> A revelation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em> says that Logan's adamantium is actually toxic and his healing factor is constantly having to counteract blood poisoning. Not only should a non-reactive indestructible metal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry">not work like that</a> (there's a reason metals like titanium and stainless steel are used in surgical implants), but it creates a big fat plot hole in the perfectly healthy forms of Lady Deathstrike, Cyber, and Bullseye (all of whom have adamantium skeletons) and the formerly healthy Hammerhead (who had an adamantium skull). You could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> Deathstrike and Cyber (both being cyborgs who could presumably have systems that could deal with the toxicity). The otherwise normal human Bullseye and Hammerhead? Not so much. There have also been a few cases where Wolverine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">has had his mutant power supressed</a> (such as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">cartoon</a>), yet retains his claws and skeleton due to them not being mutant powers. Why does this not cause him to rapidly die from adamatine poisoning, now that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is gone?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod">JLA: Act of God</a></em> there are numerous plot holes and discrepancies throughout the series, none of which are ever resolved or even realized:
<ul><li> The black light event is specifically stated to have removed all superpowers while leaving all technology unaffected, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">ring</a> is a completely technological device that is also rendered inoperable, while other characters' futuristic, alien, or otherwise fantastic technology like Booster Gold's costume and Blue Beetle's scarab work just fine, and nobody ever mentions the discrepancy.
<ul><li> To add the confusion, we see Cyborg-Superman flying around completely unaffected, when Cyborg-Superman is actually just a metahuman who has a superpower that allows him to inhabit robotic or cybernetic bodies, in this case a clone of Superman's body that has been partially robotized. In the very least his kryptonian powers should be gone. A far more likely scenario would have him just completely disappear and leave a lifeless cybernetic body behind since his one superpower that allows him to survive as an energy being would be neutralized with the black light event. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">And why aren't the characters more worried</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">that there's a psychopath with Superman's powers flying around with no one strong enough or weilding magic to stop him?</a>
</li></ul></li><li> On a more fundamental level of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plot">plot</a>, many characters lose abilities <em>that are not superpowers</em>. J'onn J'onzz's many abilities (Shapeshifting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">flight</a>, telepathy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, intangibility, etc.) are all standard abilities of his natural Martian physiology; yes, they are far beyond any human ability, but a human's ability to see is far beyond that of many animals here on earth and nobody went blind, and no gorilla suddenly lost the ability to lift a large weight, even though their natural physiology is much larger than Homo Sapiens. Like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>, the powers of the various Kryptonians (Superman, Supergirl), Aquaman and other figures are also natural abilities that are not "super" for their species in any way shape or form, yet they lost them as well.
</li><li> On a different level, it was also stated that the black light event removed all mystical and/or magical people from the world, implying that this is some sort of magical event that they could have dealt with, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> is still here. Wonder Woman's powers are mythological in nature, granted to her by the Greek Gods by way of the Amazons, she is herself a mystical being. The most basic part of the story, the black light event which de-powered the superheroes, is inconsistent, incongruous and illogical, and the characters never even <em>realize</em> it.
</li></ul></li><li> The resolution of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em> is balanced on a person who disintegrated themselves entirely immediately after performing an assassination being photographed several minutes after the assassination took place. With a camera that, depending on how you read the series's timeline, the photographer may not have owned yet.
</li><li> Two infamous plot holes from Chuck Austen's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen">Uncanny X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Holy War": The entire plot centers around Nightcrawler becoming the Pope and faking the Rapture with explosive communion wafers... except that becoming the Pope isn't nearly that easy and Catholics don't believe in the Rapture.
</li><li> "The Draco": Azazel needs to escape his dimension, so he does so by breeding teleporters to teleport him out... of the dimension he had to escape to breed them in the first place. To be fair, it's occasionally stated that he needs the teleporters to break <em>his army</em> out of the dimension. Consistency was never Austen's strong point.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainBritainAndMI13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainBritainAndMI13">Captain Britain and MI13</a></em> #10: Doctor Doom and Dracula are having a meeting on The Moon (no, this Dracula <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfDrMcNinja">doesn't have a moon base</a>). Doom warns Dracula not to attack him because he has all sorts of defenses against him, including splinters of The True Cross embedded in his armor. It's been made explicit that religious artifacts are useless against vampire if the wielder lacks faith in what that artifact represents. A fight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a> showed Dracula laughing off Wolverine's sign of the cross, but being repulsed when devout Catholic Nightcrawler did the same, so this is something Dracula knows about. It's equally explicit that Doom's only faith is in Doom, so it makes no sense to throw that detail in. Clearly, that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">Actually a Doombot</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoetAndersonTheDreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoetAndersonTheDreamWalker">Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker</a></em>, Ayo is fascinated by the concept of rain, as it doesn't naturally occur in the Dream World the same as the Waking World. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoetAndersonTheDreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoetAndersonTheDreamWalker">the Poet short film</a>, which the comics serve as a prequel to, it does rain in the Dream World city of Genesis. As Ayo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamPeople">Dream World native</a>, how would she not know what rain is?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> has plenty, but the main one is probably how Spider-Man tries to get help from various superheroes around the world to help Aunt May, who's been shot. None of them are able to heal a bullet wound, despite the fact that they have the best technology, scientific and outright magical skills of anyone on Earth — among them a character who had previously saved the life of someone whose heart was torn out of their chest. No matter how you look at it, it is simply impossible that the greatest scientists, wizards and superheroes in the world <em>are unable to heal a bullet wound.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>: During "The Witch and the Warrior" Diana needs to recover her lasso in order to have Superman touch it in order to undo his brainwashing. This would make more sense if brainwashed Superman hadn't taken the lasso from her with his bare hands to begin with, then held onto it for a second before tossing it to Silver Swan, all with no effect, despite the fact that the lasso should have broken through the brainwashing as soon as he touched it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15bg0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15bg0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15bg0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While the powers and mechanics of the lasso have changed quite a bit over the decades, in most continueties, including this one, touching it is enough to induce it's truth-compelling, mind-control breaking effects; it doesn't need to be wrapped around the person.</span> The lasso then works perfectly once Diana's recovered it and lassos him with it.

Jon mentions a few times that Nermal lives on the farm with his parents, and yet every time Jon and Garfield visit Jon's parents, Nermal is nowhere to be seen, and Garfield tends to be ambivalent towards visits to the farm, despite his mortal enemy supposedly living there.

Along the way his ship crashes onto a random mountain, and somehow the regeneration pod needed to fix him is just sitting there on top of the mountain waiting for him, with no explanation as to how it got there or why it would be there on this random mountain in the middle of nowhere. One might assume it fell out of Stitch's ship, but we last saw the regeneration pod in Jumba's lab, and he rushed out without it as soon as it was finished to get Stitch. Even if he somehow sneaked it onto the ship offscreen in a very small viable time frame, the regen pod is completely unharmed from the crash and conveniently in a perfect upright position.

The arch-villain was surprised when Fidget told him he ran into Basil at the toy shop, and obviously didn't realize that Basil was already working on this particular case. So why was Fidget spying on Olivia at Basil's apartment if Ratigan didn't tell him to do so? Though in all fairness, even if Ratigan didn't order Fidget to go there, he did commission Fidget to find Olivia, so it was possible that Fidget would guess she would be at Basil's.

<ul><li> The most notable is the source of the Amulet Nicodemus gives Mrs. Brisby. In fact, Nicodemus' magic powers in general. The film never explains where either came from. It's not even addressed if Nicodemus got those abilities as a side effect of the injection (which would raise questions about why the other rats got no such abilities) or if he was intelligent enough to learn them on his own. Years later, Don Bluth handwaved the presence of the amulet <a class="urllink" href="http://www.adammcdaniel.com/DonBluth/Don_Bluth_Interview3.htm">in an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent">"With regard to the amulet, it is a metaphor for believing in one's self. Remember the quote, "Courage of the heart is very rare, the stone has a power when it's there." It helps symbolize her courage and the power of the stone to help rescue her children...a miracle, if you will. God stuff. Granted, it isn't in the original novel, but we felt that it was much more powerful. Nicodemus says it was Jonathan's, but really just to get her to accept it. We didn't really think it was necessary to explain it further. Seems like we would eat up too much screen time to tell the history of the amulet, when the story was about an innocent widow mouse, who, thru her journey would find out that she has the courage to rescue her own family. Regarding magic, we really believe that animation calls for some magic, to give it a special "fantastic" quality. The stone or amulet is just a method of letting the audience know that Mrs. Brisby has found 'Courage of the Heart'. Magic? Maybe. Spiritual? Yes."
</div></li><li> The film never really makes a distinction about how much more intelligent the rats are than other animals, aside from the obvious results of scientific progress and the self consciousness of humanlike responsibility shifted onto them. The other animals are clearly capable of communication, rational thought and thinking skills like decision making and deductive reasoning. Did the injection simply give the rats a bigger idea of comprehension than the other animals?
</li><li> If the Rats wanted to leave no trace behind of their lair, how were they going to take care of hiding something as massive as the council room?
</li><li> Why is it that Mrs. Shrew recommends Mrs. Brisby see the Great Owl when Mr. Ages makes it clear that no one else has seen the Great Owl and lived to tell about it? How would she have known If he was wise, or if it was even sensible to ask for his help if he had that kind of reputation?
</li><li> And why does Mr. Ages have a makeshift lab built inside a giant piece of farm equipment? Since he doesn't like visitors anyway, wouldn't It have been safer to keep the lab within the boundaries of the rats' lair, instead of putting himself in a situation that could call to attention his above average knowledge of science and medicine to outsiders?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59a9c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note59a9c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59a9c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">also note that in the book, he lived in a much more sensible hideout—an old, long abandoned building.</span>

Except one day Chanticleer doesn't crow and the sun rises anyway, so the animals make fun of him until he leaves. Then while he's gone, the sun never rises on the farm because Chanticleer isn't there to crow. So why did the sun come up that one time?

And how did Llort even learn about New York in the first place or even know if it was as bad as he made it out to be, since the Troll Kingdom is clearly a far ways off from any place humans would be around?

He only uses it for plants at first because his dream is to cover the world in greenery.</span>
</li><li> While Gnorga going to New York without bringing other trolls can be written off due to her impatient, temperamental personality, did she even consider that sending a tornado to destroy Central Park, located in one of the most densely populated cities on Earth, all just to capture a rogue troll and two kids, would attract a lot of unwanted attention?

Woody almost certainly had to have been owned by someone else besides Andy (due to the age of <em>Woody's Roundup</em>, an obviously fifties puppet show Western), probably Andy's father, but Andy is the only owner Woody talks about. Unless Andy's dad shoved Woody in a box the day after he got him (unlikely for a child of the fifties with less entertainment options), that is. It was only years later revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> had an <em>extremely</em> convoluted backstory to explain this, revealing that exactly such a thing did happen (in a way) and that Woody is a one-of-a-kind prototype. Of course, this is never at any point mentioned in the movies themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em> has one that completely invalidates the character arc of one of its main characters, namely the hacker emoji Jailbreak. See, Jailbreak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is actually a princess emoji who ran away to become her own person as female emojis have always only been allowed to be princess or bride emojis and nothing else.</span> The plot hole comes in when you realize that there are <em>plenty</em> of female versions of other emojis seen throughout the smartphone, not the least of which includes two <em>major characters</em>: Gene the hero's mother, a female "Meh" emoji, and the movie's main villain, a female happy face emoji. The result is that Jailbreak's entire motivation winds up coming off as nonsensical.
</li><li> Due to its rushed production, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a> 2: Legends of Metru Nui</em> has a number of confusing bits, mainly concerning the true identity of Turaga Dume. He's shown serving the evil Makuta, whom he talks to through a mirror. Later, we find out Dume <em>is</em> Makuta, having stolen Dume's mask, but when the heroes find the real Dume, his mask is on his face. The latter is mostly artistic licence born out of necessity — viewers wouldn't recognize Dume without his mask, and the designers had created no maskless CG models for the characters, so the animators had no choice but to show Dume with his mask still on. Makuta talking to himself through a mirror makes no sense, though. Some have rationalized that the mirror "reflected the false Dume's true self", but the animation actually shows both Dume's reflection <em>and</em> Makuta's eyes separate from each other. The film's novelization reveals that only when "Dume" looks into the mirror for the second time, wearing the stolen mask, were we supposed to see that his reflection is Makuta's. The animation messes this scene up by showing Dume's body with Makuta's mask looking into the mirror, ruining the reveal and making the whole existence of the mirror pointless. But even if the animation followed the novel, Makuta talking to himself in the previous scene would still make no sense. Some fans theorize he was talking to another Makuta who happened to have the same voice, but that's stretching things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE">Wall E</a></em>: The entire basis of the film is that humanity left the heavily polluted Earth to allow the robots to clean it. Problem is, is that it's a major plot point that the excursion, which was only supposed to last five years, went for 700 years. Thing is though, if they overstayed their time by that long, how were they able to stay supplied and not die out in the intervening time? Even if you assume that the Axiom had extra supplies, it's highly doubtful at best that the creators would have the foresight to pack so far ahead of the planned time.

A few, for the record:
<ul><li> An alien race concerned with nothing but mining the Earth for all its gold deposits has somehow overlooked Fort Knox the whole time they've been on the planet (that's <em>almost 1,000 years</em>, folks).
</li><li> The human resistance movement is able to defeat the alien overlords with the help of human technology and innovation that's over 1,000 years old, despite the fact that humans 1,000 years ago (who actually <em>built</em> the technology and had <em>experience using it</em>) somehow failed to repel the dreadlocked menace and were supposedly defeated in only <em>nine minutes</em>. Oh, and it turns out that jet fuel lasts thousands of years without evaporating or degrading. To say nothing of the jets not rusting or otherwise showing any signs of age.
</li><li> The defeat of the entire alien race depends on accepting a truly batshit and <em>very</em> false concept about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics">radiation being explosive</a>. Technically it's not the radiation that's explosive, it's some of the chemicals in the alien atmosphere that react explosively in the presence of the kind of radiation produced by uranium.

This establishes two things: 1) mass is conserved (the only change is density) and 2) there should be a lower limit to his shrinking ability. The movie forgets these facts when it's convenient, allowing Scott Lang punch people without hitting like a bullet, ride ants when he should crush them, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shrink down to near Planck length at the climax of the film when he explicitly should not</span>. The ant and Thomas the Tank Engine toy that get hit with size-increasing weapons should have floated away, having become far lighter than air, and Hank Pym walks around with an apparently functional T-34 on his keychain like it doesn't still weigh twenty-five tons.

During the events of <em>Civil War</em>... Zemo sneaks onto the ultra secure base where Bucky is being held, apparently using nothing more complex than a fake passport. When Tony learns the truth, we find out that all Zemo did was meet the psychiatrist at the airport, killed him in the hotel and then stole his ID. He didn't hack any computers to change files as Tony can immediately pull up the correct ones. This means that after catching Bucky and sending for the UN's best shrink, the CIA - did not arrange to meet the man at the airport, or at his hotel, didn't know what the real man looked like before he arrived, didn't check with anyone what the real man looked like before he arrived and when Zemo turned up... they let him in to speak with the most dangerous, wanted criminal in history without so much as checking his finger prints, or googling the real dude on Facebook to see if his pictures line up. There is NO good explanation how Zemo could get into that base without the use of advanced technology.

It has never been explained. Archie and the others couldn't figure it out for years as well as Mr. One-Two and Co. having to go though lots of effort to find that info. Which they did by bribing Stella's gay husband, who was a lawyer in criminal cases, a date promise from Handsome Bob. While Johnny somehow knew that secret all along. What is twice weird is that he didn't tell anyone about Lenny. He at least could've told Archie who was suppose to be his friend.

It has no way of knowing this, unless John was somehow dumb enough to spread the information around while fully aware his sworn enemy has access to time traveling robots. You could argue that future Skynet had sent that information back in time to its past self in the hopes of killing Conner before he became anyone of note in the resistance. But this is both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a> and never mentioned in the film.

<ul><li> The crew finds out that Kyle Pratt's daughter supposedly died with her father. No-one on the crew thought to point out the obvious: where is the other casket? If she was just acting out of grief and delusion, there should be two caskets in the plane, not just the one carrying her dead husband. Good thing Pratt's not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">idiot</a>. There is also a rare case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> making everything worse: Kyle does ask Carson where the other casket is and he claims that he doesn't care after the trouble she's caused everyone on board. While it's later revealed that he is the villain, this still only calls attention to the fact that Captain Rich and the other flight attendants don't care either. See: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a>. There are also quite a few others. But the most amusing one has to be when Carson is lying to the captain about Kyle being the hijacker. He tells her that she outright refuses to negotiate (as to not blow his cover) and to go ahead and have the airline wire the $50 million "she" demanded without "her knowing". Next scene shows him getting a call from the captain saying it's been wired. Yeah, that's very much how real life does not work. The airline has no idea who she is and Carson gives no evidence whatsoever that's she's a hijacker. Yeah, we'll all believe she's a hijacker because an air marshal, the person one should trust the most on an airplane, says so. At the very least, the airline would want a background identity to consider wiring the money.
</li><li> For "The Twist" to work, someone would have had to pick up the daughter and carry her to the hiding place. How did no one notice him doing this? For that matter, nobody in nearby seats, except for another child right at the end of the film, ever mentioned seeing the child.
</li><li> The conspiracy would only work if Kyle got on that specific flight, with Carson as the sky marshal assigned to that flight. Yet she just books tickets on the next available flight. (Just as an aside, the FBI would not be present when the plane lands at Goose Bay, Newfoundland; the RCMP would.)

When he's trying to convince someone he is altering the past, he uses a trip back in time to give himself injuries sure to leave scars, and instead of the entire time between being rewritten so he always had those scars like every other time, they just magically appear in front of the person he's trying to convince.

<ul><li> Ash chains Bad Ash to a table in the windmill he's squatting in before hacking him to pieces with his chainsaw. The problem with this is that during the scene where Ash arrived at the windmill his horse, which may have been carrying the chainsaw, was scared off into the woods by the evil entity chasing him. Ash was left to run to the windmill on foot, where he was clearly not carrying the chainsaw.
</li><li> When Ash escapes from The Pit, as spiked walls close on it. Several minutes later, the monster from the pit climbs out, despite the walls still being closed, and Ash shoots it with his shotgun that he didn't have a few seconds earlier, causing it to fall back into the pit and land in the water below. (Though in the Director's Cut, a villager was explicitly shown giving Ash the shotgun back.)
</li></ul></li><li> A big plot hole occurs at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005">Alone in the Dark (2005)</a></em>. The Xenos (the monsters that Carnby has been fighting for half of the movie) are supposed to be weak against light, but he and Cedrac are attacked by them in broad daylight after they emerge from underground.

During the opening credits, the drive into the Sandin's neighborhood is seen, and it appears to be a somewhat gated suburb a ways away from the main city, with a long, curving road leading to their house. Later in the film, Bishop runs into the neighborhood, and takes shelter in the Sandin house. Several minutes pass before and the gang of purgers are seen entering the suburb through the gates, yet they somehow know positively which house their victim is in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2">Die Hard 2</a></em> seems to be made of plot holes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>:
<ul><li> The whole plot begins with the US government transporting a high-value prisoner to a civilian airport instead of the nearby military airfield.
</li><li> The terrorists hold the planes hostage in the air by shutting down the lights at Dulles Airport. Given the amount of time and fuel the planes are depicted as having, they could have easily made it to dozens of other civilian or military airports. Any of the <strong>three</strong> other airports in the DC area could have warned the airborne planes with their own non-crippled radio system and then the terrorist threat evaporates.
</li><li> Colonel Stuart's men also have control over all tower operations and radio communications and some instrument readings in what may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacking</a>. That's how they pancake the plane as proof of their threat. A piece of fridge logic does set in when the other planes don't land after the first crash. Debris on the field?
</li><li> The snowmobile shootout: the "terrorists" fire on Stuart's men with blanks and switch to live ammo to shoot at McClane. That is impossible, as blank rounds can't generate enough gas pressure to cycle the action of an autoloader (which they were clearly using) without an adapter. Firing live ammo in a blank-adapted gun will destroy it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MindHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MindHunters">Mind Hunters</a></em>, after repeatedly remarking that the simulation "doesn't feel real" without his gun, Vince pulls out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock">dramatically cocks</a> a gun and he'd concealed in his wheelchair. All the other characters berate him for this, as they'd been specifically told not to bring weapons. However, just minutes earlier, Nic and LL Cool J's character can clearly be seen bearing handguns as they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">carry JD's corpse.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a></em> movie has a ton of them.
<ul><li> First of all the band see supposedly live footage of themselves performing in Los Angeles (meant to be their clones). Except the footage being shown is from their Carnival Tour when Paul was still in the band, so none of them comments on why there is a seventh band member onstage or why Jo, Jon and Hannah have extremely different hairstyles from their clone counterparts when they seem them later. And the exact same performance is shown again at the end of the movie, still meant to be a live show.
</li><li> Second of all the trio that kidnap the clones - Jo, Bradley and Tina - are the ones that find out who Victor Gaughan is and that they were cloned. When the real Jon, Hannah and Rachel get kidnapped Jon says "Gaughan is going to clone us again" when he shouldn't have any idea who Gaughan is or that they've even been cloned in the first place. Later when the whole band meet Gaughan Rachel asks "are you the man who bought the knickers off the internet?" when again, she shouldn't know that. Though if you wanted to, you could suggest that the other three explained to them in the couple of minutes they left the cell to when they were captured again.
</li><li> To get the clones to revolt, the Bradley clone gives a passionate speech about how great the outside world is...when his only experience of it was the week or so he'd been on tour and kept in careful isolation. While it is shown that the clones get programmed to love what the real band members love, it's unlikely Alistair would give them programming to make them want to rebel. He also mentions boomerangs but the Rachel and Hannah clones had no idea what a boomerang was until they were kidnapped so why should Bradley know? Now if the Rachel, Hannah or Jon clones had given the speech then that would make sense.
</li><li> When the band kidnaps three of the clones, they do so while shooting a music video and we see the real Hannah and Jon having to improvise the dance routine since they haven't learned it yet. However we see Rachel following it perfectly when she shouldn't know it at all.
</li><li> Rachel switches with her clone by sitting down in front of a piece of glass, pretending it's a mirror and then copying what the clone does. How the hell did she pull that off? The clones are a bit dim but you'd think they know how a mirror works.
</li><li> Jo's clone does not appear in the shower scenes (in real life she had a back injury which required for her role to be less physical) but the other clones don't mention where she is, especially since they say Jon must be reported to Alistair for not showering with them.
</li><li> The band's travel manager Natalie arrives at the end of the film with the police at Eagle Peak. First of all, she was in Spain so how did she get to LA so quickly, or know to get the police? How does she know the band are at Eagle Peak? For her to get there in the space of time the band knew about Eagle Peak she must have teleported from Spain.

<ul><li> Laura's entire escape plan. Safely swimming to shore in conditions that would have drowned Michael Phelps - dark, bad weather, far from shore. And where she did she get the money for her escape, her mother's stay at the nursing home, and renting and maintaining the large house she rents? No part-time library job is going to pay for that (Hollywood magic money, dontcha know? Also known as the "dream hobby job").
</li><li> The thing with the ring. Why be so incredibly stupid that you can't figure out that maybe the ring won't flush? Why be so completely irrational after planning something for so long? And why didn't she <em>check</em> to see if it had washed away? Or heck, if she went far enough that he wouldn't likely see it in a consignment shop or something, why not hock the thing for extra cash?
</li><li> Come to think of it, why didn't she tell her swimming partners or teacher that she was planning to run away from her psychotic husband? She could have called them and said, "Hey do not tell my batass crazy hubby I took swimming lessons, m'kay?"
<ul><li> This one <em>does</em> have some basis in reality. She was the victim of long-term physical and psychological abuse, and probably believed her husband would kill her and/or her family if she told anyone. Her swim partners would be obligated to call the police, and see the previous sentence for the result if she told. Hence the reason most women don't report abuse.

A vehicle that shows up a few times through the film, a snow-maker, is eventually and quite logically the protagonists' best weapon. However, the vehicle also has a snow plow on the front. It projects new snow out in front of it, and then... plows through the snow. Trey Stokes, moderately known for the podcast Down In Front and puppeteer for the creature in the 1988 remake, admitted that the snow-maker exists in this snake-eating-its-own-tail manner <em>specifically</em> because the protagonists will need it later.

Doc Ock somehow finds Peter with Mary Jane in a random cafe and throws a car through the window straight at them. Both would've been killed instantly, had Peter's spider sense not been triggered. But Doc Ock at this point has no idea that Peter actually is Spider-Man. Given that Peter is his only lead on Spider-Man, it makes no sense that Doc Ock would effectively try to kill him. Of course, Octavius has retained very little of his original sanity as a result of his tentacles taking control of his mind, so that's some explanation. Near the film's climax, Peter asks Harry to tell him the location of Doc Ock's hideout so he can save MJ and the city. Harry's reply is not shown, but Peter does manage to find his way there. If this was because Harry had told him where it was, how did Harry know? Doc Ock never told him, and it wouldn't have made any sense for him to do so. Nor is there any indication that Harry had been keeping tabs on Ock. And if Peter was able to find his way there somehow anyway, why did he even ask Harry?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> has a huge gap of logic. Namely, how in the hell does Eddie Brock/Venom know anything at all about Sandman? Much less about how Spider-Man won't let him help his sick daughter? Readers of the comic may know the symbiote bestows information about Peter to Eddie, giving a reasonable explanation about how he knows about Sandman, though not the daughter. However, this is not outright stated in the film so newcomers may still be in the dark.

Plot hole: they <em>first</em> had to remove one of Khan's people from the cryotube. Why not use <em>that</em> person's blood?
<ul><li> The novelization ended up explaining this — McCoy was <em>not</em> going to risk waking up that guy and go "Oh, hey, does your blood heal all wounds, too?" and risk having <em>two</em> superhuman psychopaths running around.

</li></ul></li><li> The film series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> did its best, with many of the earlier holes due to later books not being released, and to their credit the writers did attempt to mop errors up as best as they could. But there are some that have no real justification.
<ul><li> At the end of the first film, Hagrid reminds Harry that the Dursleys don't know underage magic is forbidden. The second film cuts the letter informing the Dursleys of that fact after Dobby levitates the cake. Yet Vernon suddenly loses his fear of Harry and barricades him in, despite having no reason to believe Harry wouldn't turn him into a frog or blast the bars off the windows (especially since he leaves Harry his wand and trunk).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a>,</em> Lupin berates Harry for being so careless as to wander the corridors at night with a map that could lead a murderer right to him. But it's never explained to either Harry or the audience a) how Lupin knows that the blank piece of parchment is a map, b) how Sirius Black would know that it was a map, c) why Harry having the map makes it any more dangerous, as Sirius would have to get to him in order to get the map, or d) why Lupin keeping the map makes it safer, as surely it would be an advantage if Harry saw that Sirius was anywhere in the castle grounds - he could just run in the opposite direction. In the film, it's also never revealed that the map's authors, "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs," were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius, and James Potter</span>. That would at least have cleared up a couple of these inconsistencies.
<ul><li> The entire subplot of Crookshanks and Scabbers is all but cut from the film, making Ron and Hermione's quarrel over their pets seem to come out of nowhere and never get resolved.
</li></ul></li><li> The lack of explanation about the Marauders leads over into all the successive films, as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em> Harry refers to Sirius as Padfoot for no apparent reason. The significance of his patronus being a stag and Lily and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Snape</span>'s being a doe is left unexplained, which also causes Harry's insistence that it was James who saved him and Sirius from the dementors in PoA to look incredibly stupid.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em>Goblet</em>, thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the whole Crouch subplot being cut</span> and Dumbledore's questioning of the culprit who put Harry's name in the Goblet are all totally cut, the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barty Crouch Jr. did it</span> makes absolutely no sense. Especially because Harry is told that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Crouch died</span>. The movie could have given the culprit a totally different name and the film would make exactly the same amount of sense.
</li><li> Another Crouch Jr. related plot hole is that there is no mention of him getting the Dementor's kiss. The movie states he will be sent to Azkaban. In later movies, Voldemort frees all the Death Eaters, but Crouch Jr. never appears alongside them despite playing a major part in Voldemort's return.

(Actually he gives him a wrapped package in the fifth book and says "don't open it here.") Sure, this is mentioned later, when Aberforth explains that Mundungus stole it and sold it, but anyone who hadn't read the books would probably be hard pressed to remember who that was. Also, what sort of peddler decides that a broken mirror will fetch a good price? Did he know it was magical? What's the point of a two-way mirror that can only be used when smashed? Why did Harry pick up a random piece of mirror from the Black house? Why does he obsess over it before he sees Aberforth?
</li><li> The scene explaining the taboo on Voldemort's name in DH is deleted, so it just looks like the trio either have incredibly bad luck, or the Death Eaters are fantastic trackers who don't tell Voldemort where to find Harry and inexplicably go after him themselves, and Xenophilius Lovegood is insane, but happens to have incredible timing.

Fans of the books will realize she was about to say she's pregnant, but this subject is not broached again until <em>the end of part two</em> when Harry sees Ghost!Lupin right before he is about to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> die</span> and says "I'm sorry you never got to know your son." Harry has absolutely <em>no frigging way of knowing Lupin had a kid at all</em>, and even if he (uncharacteristically) extrapolated from that interrupted sentence he couldn't have known it was a boy. This is a particularly frustrating one, as it would have made a hell of a lot more sense if the scriptwriters had allowed Tonks to finish that sentence.

However, this plan requires that he possesses far more information than is plausible. Having presumably witnessed his son's trial for armed robbery and the insurance company's investigation when his son was dying of AIDS after serving out his term, he should at least know the identities of Kelly (the public prosecutor), Chan (the chief witness in the trial), Eddie (the insurance investigator), and maybe Jackson (assuming that he was the investigating officer). He could have found out the identity and whereabouts of Coogan (who raped the captor's son during his stint in prison) based on information his son could have provided him. However, he never knew anything about Sully loaning money to Christian, Leon selling the gun to Christian that was used in the robbery, Christian confessing to Father Francis that he was the real robber, or Kelly deceiving Jackson so she could forge the evidence, nor could he have known without being omniscient. This is poorly handwaved by the captor explaining his scheme took two years of planning.

Cleveland then later trades three second round draft picks to acquire the #6 pick from Jacksonville. Then Seattle trades the same three first rounders <em>back to Cleveland</em> to move up from #7 to #6.

This culminates with Vinny giving the Judge the false name "Jerry Callo" as the name under which he legally practiced law. However, the judge tells him he is requesting information on his alias, and will have it by the end of the trial. The next time this is brought up, it revealed that Vinny's fiancée had asked a friend in New York to fax the judge false information about the fictitious Callo's legal career. But Vinny had never told her that was the name he'd given the judge. Furthermore, if it had been easy enough to send the judge fake information about Callo, then it would have been just as easy to send fake information about Vinny in the first place.
<ul><li> Possible explanation: it is Vinny's fiancée who points out that the first name Vinny used, "Jerry Gallow", won't hold up under scrutiny, so it's not unlikely she and Vinny thought up "Callo" together. And the fake information only became a factor after the judge had already checked up on Vinny.

It is never explained how/why they could plan this caper with only a few days warning. The necessity of a game seven cannot be known until the outcome of game six is determined, assuming that a series reaches the sixth contest. In other words, game seven is the only one in a best-of-seven series that cannot be guaranteed more than one game in advance.

But after the Bloofer Lady is mentioned, the film <em>forgets</em> about her. Particularly notable is that the Spanish-language version, shot at the same time on the same sets (literally filming immediately after the English-language version wrapped for the day) with largely the same script, <em>does</em> resolve this point!

The problem is the song came out in 1961, while in the movie she dies in 1957. You could say she heard the song and started liking it after she died, however the movie implies her spirit has been lying dormant for decades and is "awakened" when the protagonist opens an old trunk holding her clothes and tiara, not to mention that "she still listens to the radio as a ghost" is a pretty weird explanation to start with.

The problem is: this implies Superman (and, presumably, all the DCU superheroes) exist in the films' universe. Which raises tons of questions such as: why do we never see them or even hear anyone else talk about them? Why do they never come help out Batman when Gotham's in grave danger? And why are the people in the first movie so skeptical about Batman existing if superheroes both exist and are apparently common knowledge? Really, the only way around this is to just claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">the joke was only for the viewers and doesn't exist in the context of the movie's universe.</a>

Pointedly, this makes far less sense than the explanation used for the Squad in other DC media, which portrays them as just a secret black ops team used by the governments dirty work.

The main 5 Rangers all have both suits from each season in the second and he's the only one to switch colors in between while previous seasons that had the teams go from on <em>Sentai</em> to the next generally get rid of the previous powers for the characters to get new ones, minus <em>Zeo</em> for some reason, but there was a lot going on behind the scenes at the time), the Ranger Keys not being given a proper origin explanation despite the Morphin Grid existing, which would've been <em>perfect,</em> why their motif shifts from mystical animals to pirates, the editors and producers leaving in <em>Sentai</em>-only Ranger suits in the stock footage with little more than an initial handwave to explain them (in fact, they actually made new versions of 4 of the suits in one of the last few episodes because they couldn't be bothered to replace more than 1 of them for a fight) with the Rangers acting like they make perfect sense to be there and knowing their powers, and/or the writers being lazy or just being told to translate the <em>Sentai</em> episodes almost word-for-word, which have the characters either act out of character (more like their <em>Sentai</em> counterparts) or have inconsistent characterizations as a result of the writers not caring or having enough time to script the episodes properly. Orion probably has it the worst of the main cast, though, since he gets his Morpher and Ranger Key essentially out of thin air when he was mining on his home planet one day and there's no explanation for that, then the fact that he can pilot an Armada ship, then the fact that he can fight with other Ranger powers with no explanation or training given or shown, and he has a complete personality shift the next episode after his introduction with no explanation.

As fast as even new ZPMs were depleted in use, there would have had to be a way to make them with relative ease, and 3.

There is no further elaboration of this point, and no examples of said high prices are given, presumably because any price high enough to justify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> leaving a colony full of innocents at the mercy of a cruel universe indefinitely would be out of character, even for the Vulcans of this era.

First of all Chris's hair is long in the flashbacks when it was short when he first appeared at the end of Season 5, as well as his clothes being different. Second of all, the flashback shows Chris going through a portal in the attic when he orbed into the attic in his first episode. And when he first appeared, he says he has come to stop the Titans as they rule the world in his future. Yet the flashbacks have no mention of the Titans.
</li><li> He also mentions that Paige was killed by the Titans yet in a later episode he says he goes to her for money in the future.
</li><li> A real Plot hole in the Chris plot is the whole Valhala thing. Why did he send Leo to Valhala in the first place? It's what caused Leo and Piper's temporary breakup which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nearly stops them from doing the dirty and conceiving him</span>. It's like he wanted to make his mission as difficult as possible.
</li><li> A lot of stuff in later <em>Charmed</em> was like this, since they were often implied that they had always been there, and the Charmed Ones really should have seen them already, prompting fan reactions of "Where the hell were they before?!" Two examples:
<ul><li> The Cleaners: Magical entities that were supposed to erase incidents and people that exposed magic to the real world. They were severely disliked because there were multiple incidents of magic being exposed that they never acted during, such as the exposure that resulted in Prue dying.
</li><li> Magic School: This one really bugged people since it would have greatly helped the Charmed Ones when they were still learning their abilities. It's designed for children, sure, but considering they were the Chosen Ones, they could all any help they could get.
</li><li> The Charmed Ones themselves: The series starts with Prue, Piper, and Phoebe discovering and gradually accepting that they have magical powers and a destiny. Later in the series, this aspect is entirely ignored, and the narrative treats it as if they've been kicking demon ass their whole lives. When the Elders are going to shut down the Magic School, pointing out that the Charmed ones didn't need it, Paige explains that it's because they were taught by their family and not every magical user <em>has</em> magical family. Except Paige is the only one who actually <em>did</em> learn from her family. The other girls got occasional help from the ghosts of their mother and grandmother, but the bulk of their training came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyOrDie">Fly Or Die</a> demon hunting.

<ul><li> The last season introduces a new form of Super-Vampire called the Turok-Han. They have the same weaknesses as regular vampires. They die by a wooden stake in the heart, or decapitation, or sunlight. But their strengths are massively amplified, to the point that the highly experienced and strong Buffy Summers is unable to drive a stake deep enough through the Turokahn's super tough and thick skin to pierce its heart. A vicious, brutal, lopsided beatdown of curbstomp proportions ensues. Later Buffy is only able to kill this one Turokhan by luring him to a battlefield of her choosing where, after a lengthy battle she finally manages to decapitate him using razor wire. So, clearly the Turok-Han are insanely tough right? This was the point. Cue the inverse law of Ninjas. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E22Chosen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E22Chosen">Chosen</a>", Buffy and her squad of newly activated rookie slayers proceed to casually and effortlessly dust Turok-Hans left and right. Upstairs, the purely human (but fairly badass by human standards) Robin Wood is also effortlessly killing every Turok-Han that comes near him with a simple metal knife to the chest. Nerdy little Andrew and clueless Anya (also both human, and considerably less combat-capable than Robin) are also effortlessly killing Turok-Hans. Anya kills one with a glancing blow from her sword to the hip. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> acknowledges the inconsistency, but says that the story of empowerment is more important than continuity <a class="urllink" href="http://slayageonline.com/EBS/btvs/DVD_Commentaries/chosen.htm">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">fan theory</a> is that the first Turokhan was much tougher because it had had a chance to feed unlike the Turokhan horde which was emerging from having been trapped underground for millenia.

He escapes, beating up several Initiative personnel on the way out, but when he tries to kill Willow, he learns the hard way that they implanted a chip in his brain that causes him excruitating pain whenever he tries to hurt humans. But again, he beat up the human scientists earlier in the episode, after the chip was installed, without any problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> also acknowledged this as an oversight.

She then cuts Opie loose because she doesn't have enough to hold him, but bugs his phone and car on the chance that he says something incriminating. SAMCRO has every reason to believe that Opie's the snitch and of course they do believe this, which is confirmed in their minds when they find the bugs. Now at this point, the Cops and ATF know that A) either SAMCRO or Opie himself discovered the bugs and destroyed them- in either case they are not going to produce any evidence, B) SAMCRO is extremely likely to murder Opie as a result of their little trick, and C) in 24 hours, the US Attorney will reveal his case, charging Opie and proving that he is <em>not</em> the snitch. Hale, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Fair Cop</a>, is torn up about what to do - reasoning that if he tells SAMCRO that Opie is not the snitch, he is leaking classified information. But all he needs to do is keep him safe for one night, and the answer should be staring him in the face: <em>arrest Opie</em> on a trumped-up charge (which is hardly as bad as the crap they pulled to get to this point) and keep him off the streets for 24 hours. The truth comes out the very next day. But he dithers so long that Opie's wife is murdered in a botched hit because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate">Acquitted Too Late</a>, setting off the events of Season 2.
</li><li> A rather small one appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> season 4, episode 9. Dina agrees to tell CTU all she knows if they can guarantee her son's safety. The son then tells his father, who is attempting to kill him, that if he kills him his mother will tell CTU everything because she cares about his safety. Does not compute!
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadAboutYou">Mad About You</a></em> episode "The Caper", several different couples go into the Buckmans' neighbor's apartment to fetch food. Each couple, when they return, comments on the neighbor's gorgeous painting. When the painting goes missing, each couple in turn is accused of having stolen it while they were fetching the food — despite the fact that the later couples reported it was still there when they saw it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> While both Peter and Sylar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> were in those medical comas, there comes the issue that in season 1 the room Sylar was kept in seemed to dampen abilities (if the Haitian/Renee was there the whole time he would've stopped Eden), whereas in season 2 Peter needs to take pills to dampen abilities, and in season three there's early on the drug induced comas</span>
</li><li> In Volume 2, it's revealed that Adam Monroe injecting his healing blood into Peter also 'cures' his Haitian-induced memory loss. However, Peter already has that ability, and used it to heal himself after being shot in Ireland. Why didn't this restore his memory?
</li><li> Furthermore, in Volume 1 HRG sends the Haitian to wipe Claire's memory. The Haitain does not wipe her memory, but given what we know about Adam and Adam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, this would have been impossible anyway. This could be explained away by saying that HRG and the Haitian didn't know this, but considering they've both spent decades working for the Company (an operation that captures and studies evolved humans) and have had Adam Monroe as a prisoner all that time, it seems unlikely that they'd never tried to erase his memory and would thus, be unaware of this information.
</li><li> This one's a doozy: At the end of Season 2, Nathan is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shot during a press conference before he can reveal his powers to the world</span>. When Season 3 begins, we find out that Nathan is miraculously back to normal, which apparently is the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Linderman, apparently a ghost, healing him with his Healing power</span>. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> later on, we find out that Linderman wasn't real, and was instead a figment of Maury Parkman's imagination, projected using his Mind Control power</span>. That's all fine and dandy, except... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> WHO THE HELL HEALED NATHAN?</span> Unsurprisingly, this is never explained or even addressed.
<ul><li> It's directly addressed in episode eight of season two, <em>Four Months Ago...</em> A flashback reveals that Adam Monroe  who has healing powers similar to Claire  injects some of his blood into Nathan in order to heal him.
</li></ul></li><li> Another plot hole regards the age at which Claire manifested her healing powers. When Claire reunites with her birth mother, Meredith Gordon, and later, her birth father, Nathan Petrelli, it is revealed Nathan and Meredith believed their 18-month old daughter, Claire, perished in a fire. Claire's grandmother, Angela Petrelli, reveals she has protected Claire from the Company (see above) since Claire's infancy and knew she survived but allowed Claire's father to believe his daughter died in the fire. Claire assumes she survived the fire due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> but the problem with this assumption is that other episodes establish Claire's healing ability as manifesting when she was a teenager, not as a baby. Also, a graphic novel depicts 18-month old Claire being carried out of the burning building by one of the Company's agents, Noah Bennet, who Angela arranged to become Claire's adoptive father after the fire. Since this graphic novel was not depicted on the show, most viewers are in the dark about this detail and the age at which Claire manifested her powers remains confused.
</li><li> In a flashback episode, when she first leaves Primatech, Meredith refers to her daughter by name, 'Claire', who she believed died in a fire at 18 months old. Even if Primatech knew that Meredith had named her 'Claire' (in reality, it's not even clear that Primatech knew Meredith was Claire's mother at all), why would they retain it? Calling Claire a different name would have made it much harder for Meredith to find her (or vice versa).

<ul><li> At the end of Book II, Orry Main finds his wife, Madeline, whom he hasn't seen for more than two years. When he finally finds her, he sees his baby for the first time. Madeline had been pregnant with Orry's baby when she disappeared over two years ago, but when Orry meets his baby, the baby is only about six months old. This becomes more noticeable when Charles Main, Orry's cousin, makes it back to Augusta's house for the first time in two months. When he gets there, Washington informs him that Augusta is dead, but that she had died giving birth to Charles' baby. When Charles had seen her two months prior to this, she wasn't showing the least bit of being pregnant. When Charles meets his baby, the baby looks to be two years old or older even though it couldn't have been more than two months old within the timeline.
</li><li> The drummer boy who hangs out with Billy Hazard spends a few years with Billy's unit, but he doesn't age at all.
</li><li> At one point, Billy Hazard leaves his unit so he can go check on Ashton. He reasons with himself that he'll be back before his unit will see combat again, then stays gone for eight months. When he returns, sure enough, his unit hasn't been called into combat in his absence.

The series finale reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the series is set hundreds of thousands of years in our past</span>. So how'd the song get there? It was revealed late in Season 4 that Anders was a musician in his former/original life on the first Earth and that he wrote it. Why the song is identical to one from our modern era is not explained however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> has some discontinuity pertaining to Robin Sparkles. First it was a one hit wonder and her only song, then she had a second song which she said tanked, then her character was based off a TV show suddenly, then not only did she have a third song, she was one of the biggest celebrities in Canada and won many awards. She even had a very public meltdown and changed her stage name to Robin Daggers, an event that apparently every Canadian alive still remembers.

When he gets out onto Vulcan he discovers that it's one of two keys for a downed Dalek ship - the other one in the possession of the scientist who discovered the ship in the first place. It's quite reasonable for a ship key to be in the vicinity of a ship, but how the heck did the Doctor get hold of his key? Some fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> that the First Doctor had found it in an unseen Dalek encounter, but there is really no place to fit it into the continuity unless you take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a>.
</li><li> One of the aspects of the arc in Series 4 is Rose appearing despite being trapped in a parallel world. Even though the finale explains how she is returning, some of her appearances are never explained. For example in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight">Midnight</a>" she appears on a screen on another planet centuries into the future, which doesn't coincide with what was already seen. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft">Turn Left</a>" she somehow has knowledge of all the events and is able to appear at significant moments to help Donna, which is never explained either.

The Doctor sabotages the Monk's TARDIS, but the Monk still has the bazooka and its ammunition, so there's no reason why he can't still blow up the Vikings as he planned. In the novelisation a scene is added to fix the hole: The Doctor and his companions put the ammunition in the Monk's TARDIS before sabotaging it, rendering it inaccessible.

So where did it come from?

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a></em> the goddess Sif supposedly had really beautiful blond hair, so much that at one point Loki decided to cut it off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">just to a dick</a>. When her husband Thor found out, he threatened to kill Loki, but decided to spare him on the grounds that he give her new hair, at which point he basically "forged" some new hair out of gold and attached it to her head. The problem being: there's absolutely no explanation for why her hair wouldn't just grow back normally, as she's a goddess and mere mortals regrow hair that's cut off all the time. (To be fair,only a few fragments of stories about Sif survive, so the original myth may well have actuallly explained this part.)

One of them is his involvement in the infamous "Katie Vick" storyline. Apparently, Kane was partying, drinking, and driving with his girlfriend, Katie Vick, despite the fact that his character was <em>supposed</em> to have been secluded from society during that time. Speaking of Kane, his <em>hair</em> is a plot hole. Before his "official" unmasking, Kane has had his mask removed on a few occasions, albeit the hair <em>grown from his head</em> is covering his face. On the night of his "official" unmasking, Kane takes off his mask that has a wig attached, which is used to cover the little hair on his head that remained from the fire that burned him as a child. Another thing to note is that Evolution took off Kane's mask <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">five months</a></em> prior to his "official" unmasking, and yet Kane still had a full head of hair when he had his mask taken off.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a> claiming to be Kane's "father" created the first problem in Kane's backstory. Paul originally claimed that he first met Kane when he went to work at Kane and Taker's family's funeral home. The only way for all of that to be true would have been if Paul hadn't been told by the mother that he had a "son," and they never resolved that part.
</li></ul></li><li> For TNA's 2010 <em>Victory Road</em> PPV the Knockouts' title match had the stipulation where if either of champion Madison Rayne's teammates - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily">Lacey Von Erich</a> and Velvet Sky - interfered, the belt would go to Angelina Love. At the end of the match, a masked biker woman drove into the arena and attacked Angelina. The referee called for a disqualification...and awarded the title to Angelina Love, assuming it was either Velvet or Lacey under the mask. The woman refused to reveal her face and yet the referee still awarded the title to Angelina. It was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Tara</a> under the mask yet it made no sense for her to keep her face hidden for weeks when she could have taken off the mask to reveal who she was and thus let Madison keep the title. Furthermore why would Madison have her attacker wear a mask if it wasn't Velvet or Lacey? The stipulation only said Madison would lose if either of them interfered. It would only be a simple DQ if anyone else interfered. And when it was confirmed that it hadn't been Velvet or Lacey under the mask, the title switch to Angelina was still counted despite being a bad call by the referee.

Here's a small sampling of the ones that haven't been filled in yet.
<ul><li> During the Halloween 2k5 Story Line, Ian finds a pill bottle that apparently reveals that his romantic rival Gino is hiding a terrible secret from Sasha. Meanwhile, the Mansion is inexplicably lit on fire. We never find out who started the fire, nor what was in those pill bottles.
</li><li> During every event held at the Von Helson mansion, there is a spire visitors are forbidden to go to. Upon sneaking in, you see signs of a struggle, though it's never explained as to what has happened there. (Even the revelation that the Von Helsons were vampires was a surprise)
</li><li> During the Rejected Olympics event, numerous fantasy races were added to the canon, including Orcs. A subplot involving potential enslavement of the Orcs for manual labor (in a city FULL OF ROBOTS) was set up, then promptly ignored.
</li><li> The entire "Robot Rebellion" story line that has been set up ever since Aekea was opened, yet has never materialized.
</li><li> In <em>zOMG!</em>, it is stated that all the towns are completely cut off from each other due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">things coming to life and attacking people</a>. It's implied that Aekea is fighting off its factory equipment, that all the boats to Isle De Gambino have been closed, and that people attempting to walk to Durem are disappearing. And yet in the Wapanese comic, all of the NPCs are able to travel from town to town without any issues.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan7">Mega Man 7</a></em> has two different plot holes depending on the version. In the original, it was stated that Mega Man couldn't kill Dr. Wily due to robotic laws preventing him from harming a human. Why would Wily have to beg for mercy in all previous games and let Mega Man arrest him in 6? In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanKirbyIsHardcore">American</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">version</a>, Mega Man disregards those laws and tries to kill Wily. There is no explanation why he didn't try to kill Wily in all subsequent games. Admittedly, Mega Man is a nice robot, and killing Wily would not have been his first choice when he would actually have been able to do it. It took him seven games to finally realize Wily is beyond redemption.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series' titular protagonist is supposedly special since he is the first robot to have free will. Despite this, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">classic series</a> (to which the X series is a sequel to) has shown robots seemingly able to do what they like, even if they would logically not be programmed for it. Three big examples are Ballade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManIV">Mega Man IV</a></em>, who despite being made by Wily as a Mega Man Killer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">purposefully saves Mega Man's life at the cost of his own</span>, Sheep Man, who can get bored and has changed several jobs out of boredom, and Strike Man, who even before the Roboenza outbreak was deliberately harming other players he didn't like, the First Law of Robotics be damned.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>, depending on the choices you make, Nicholai will sometimes appear at the gas station and be <em>in the room</em> when it explodes, destroying an entire city block. He survives this unscathed, and without any Plot Virus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>.

It's stated that the entire city was quarantined so that no one could get in or out of the city, yet in <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, Leon and Claire casually drive into the city without anything blocking their way and the city itself looks more abandoned than destroyed. Likewise, when Jill explores the RPD building, all the doors leading to the east and west hallways (as well as the door near the S.T.A.R.S. office leading to the library) are boarded up. For Leon and Claire, the doors leading to the hallways are simply electronically locked and requires a key card to unlock.

He accomplishes the first two steps, only to discover that <em>duh</em>, he already did step three. What, did everyone think it just didn't take the first time? Especially given that Kratos has been killing gods left and right ever since, including killing Poseidon and Hermes just hours earlier? Furthermore, Zeus makes it clear that the box, which contained both the evils of the Titan's war which corrupted the gods and the power to kill him, was never supposed to have been opened in the first place. So why did he ever help Kratos reach it?
<ul><li> On top of that, at some point between the two games, Zeus puts together an elaborate mechanism to keep Pandora's Box away from intruders (see: Kratos). Reaching the box now requires such things as manipulating the chain that keeps the planes together and stopping a fire that can burn even the Gods. As implied above, <em>there is nothing in the box, and Zeus knows this!</em> And even if the empty box had value, there's still a perfectly good temple for storing it on the back of Cronos!

This is true of human and locust alike, only General RAAM can walk amongst Kryll without any damage and his means for doing this are never explained. In the DLC campaign "RAAM's Shadow" for <em>3</em> (chronologically earlier), normal Locust walk among Kryll just fine and indeed even RAAM's lieutenants are able to command the Kryll.

Being a friend of the titular heroes, working for Krew <em>and</em> being a spy for Damas should give him a hell of a lot of information about everything, but somehow he never puts two and two together. The most egregious example is about Jak's relation to Damas: Sig was sent to Haven to look for Damas's son Mar. The Kid carries the seal of Mar around his neck that indicates he might be the lost heir to the throne. Damas, of the House of Mar, was Haven's ruler before he was cast out. Logically, Sig should at least suspect that the Kid might be related to Damas, but doesn't. It gets worse when it turns out the Kid is Jak, who from that point on carries the Kid's seal with him, and people on occasion use it to <em>remind him who he is</em>.

Not only this, the blackouts contained knowledge about the Origami Killer Ethan couldn't possibly have, such as the faces of victims he's never met. In a deleted scenes montage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod">Word of God</a> stated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Origami Killer and Ethan developed a telepathic link at the start of the game when the killer witnessed Ethan risking his life for his son.</span> After some consideration, they figured that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">the plot hole was better than that explanation</a>.

This is largely understandable as the characters gaining their ultimate personas is by maxing out their social links which, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">previous game</a>, is optional, although some scenes imply that they did max out those Social Links (for example, Yukiko decided to stay in Inaba and inherit her family's inn). However, there is one exception, Teddie's social link progresses automatically with the story, which results in his persona transforming from Kintoki-Doji into Kamui. However, like the rest of the investigation team, he uses his original persona and his ultimate persona is never even mentioned.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NiNoKuni">Ni no Kuni</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of them appears early in the game when Olliver goes back to our world. People from our world cannot see nor hear people from the other world, so when Olliver asks a lady for the information he needs and right in the middle of the conversation starts to talk with his friendly magical fairy, the lady doesn't even lift an eyebrow or gets surprised of the fact that a kid <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who just lost his mom a while ago</span> is talking to himself all of a sudden. Even worse, she carries on with the conversation as if nothing happened. This rule of "nobody can see magic or people from the other world" gets violated every once in a while as the character do not even care about the consequences of using magic or talking to somebody that cannot be seen by others. Another example of this is when the characters use a spell to go from one world to another in the middle of the street and nobody wonders how or why that kid vanished into thin air.
</li><li> There is more problems with the gateway spell than that. Apparently the first time you use it you are told that you need a large space in order to cast the gateway spell, the one that will allow you to travel through worlds, so the characters go to the town square, summon a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate">Cool Gate</a></em>, and use it to go the other magical world. Afterwards this rule of "can only be cast in large spaces" is just ignored, as you can cast it anywhere, and the gate is nowhere to be seen anymore. No explanation given, of course.
</li><li> An even major example comes later in the game. The characters go back to Al Mamoon so they can ask for an audience with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Cowlipha</a> to get a permit to use a ship. The Cowlipha is apparently brokenhearted and her heart lacks restraint, so the characters are told to go wander the city asking in every shop for somebody with a lot of restraint to spare. The plot hole comes because the locket, the object used to stock pieces of heart, glows when somebody having some quality to spare from his heart is near. The game decided to just break that rule in this particular moment and have you wander around town aimlessly looking for something as vague as "somebody with a lot of restraint" when the person that you were looking for was none other that the Cowlipha's servant, the person who asked you for help, accompanied you through all this miniquest, and was even present when you discovered that she was brokenhearted and needed restraint. During all this the locket didn't shine even once.

Problem: What's good for the goose is good for the gander, Cryptic. Either there is now no warp travel anywhere in the galaxy (not true), or every physicist in the Alpha Quadrant has been talking out of his ass for two months and the Dyson spheres' Omega molecules are <em>perfectly safe power sources</em>. Or the <em>Relics</em> sphere uses something else than Omega molecules for power (entirely possible, since the Enterprise's sensors didn't pick up any in <em>Relics</em>), but in that case the <em>Relics</em> sphere becomes even <em>more</em> important than claimed, since it means everyone <em>should</em> be interested in what it used instead, which no-one seems to be.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em> series (specifically <em>Alpha 3</em>) introduces one as it relates to Juli, one of the young women M. Bison's Shadaloo organization kidnapped, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a>, and trained into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBabes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBabes">elite assassin bodyguards</a> known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">the Dolls</a>. Most of the Dolls are roughly named after a month of the year in their language of origin. Juli operates as part of a pair with Juni, both hailing from Germany (their names are German for July and June respectively). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">T.Hawk's</a> ending reveals that Juli is actually Julia, a girl from T.Hawk's Thunderfoot tribe who he's been searching for ever since she was kidnapped. Why is this a plot hole? The Thunderfoot tribe are <em>Native Americans</em> set in <em>Mexico</em>.
<ul><li> This is likely the result of a split-second executive decision. The original intent was for Noembelu (Spanish for November), a Native American Mexican like T.Hawk, to be the missing Doll he's searching for, but the staff went with Juli instead since the name transition had an ironic ease to it and they didn't want to put in the effort to make Noembelu into a playable character. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">UDON comics</a> patch up this plot hole by explaining that Julia was the daughter of a German doctor who lived with and helped care for the Thunderfoot tribe, while Noembelu actually was a pure Thunderfoot girl originally called Little Eagle.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to how much plot it has, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> naturally has plenty, though most of them are small and more like lapses in logic than actual plot holes.
<ul><li> The worst of them mostly result from the bonus case in the first game being written well after the rest of the original trilogy. Almost every statement about Edgeworth in <em>Justice for All</em> becomes inaccurate when you insert another case between the Gourd Lake incident and the start of the second game. That same case introduces a law that says evidence can only be submitted to the court if it has proven relevance to the case, though <em>every case in the series</em> outside Rise from the Ashes allows this with no consequence.
</li><li> Many small plot holes are also introduced when the games are translated, probably the most prominent being in case 3 of <em>Dual Destines</em> when the translators removed the model of Professor Means without his staff in order to shrink the ROM for the US's download-only distribution. It was only used in one scene, when you first meet the professor, because at that point his staff should be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabbed through Professor Courte's body in the courtyard</span>.
</li><li> There's at least one documented case of a plot hole being accounted for by the writers but having said fix left out of the final draft (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the police didn't believe Machi was able to fire a revolver capable of breaking a grown man's shoulder, Daryan was using his job as a detective to manipulate the investigation</span>) which forces one to wonder how many other holes might be the result of similar mistakes or cuts.
</li><li> An especially baffling example is present in the first case of <em>Apollo Justice</em>. A huge amount of the case focuses on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the victim, Shadi Smith, attempting to ruin Phoenix's career in a rigged poker game</span>. This becomes head-tilting when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's revealed near the end of the game that Shadi is actually Zak Grammyae, the defendant of Phoenix's last case and the biological father of Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy</span>. <em>Why</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zak was willing to ruin the career of his daughter's legal guardian, when Phoenix being in hospital for a few days is enough to sap the Wrights' funds,</span> is never explained, even in the flashback showing the two meeting just prior to the first case.
<ul><li> Related to the above is in the final trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we learn that Phoenix was disbarred because he presented a forged page from the victim's diary that proved that the victim was still alive after Zak had left the scene. However, we later learn that Zak had the real diary page the entire time. Why did he not give it to Phoenix or, better yet, present it to the police which would have cleared him from the get go? Even stranger is that a motive for him hiding the diary page could be explained as him not wanting suspicion to come onto Valant, who would be suspected if it was proven that Zak hadn't killed the victim. However, in the talk where he reveals that he had the diary page the whole time, he is also surprised that Valant was suspected at all.</span>
