Aces may or may not come with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingMan">wingmates</a>.

An Ace who excels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even beyond other aces</a> is known as an Ace of Aces, a title typically granted only to a nation's highest scoring ace.
</p><p>An ace pilot is not necessarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> in terms of personality, although they can be. Famous aces may be given a cool-sounding nickname like, oh, say, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>. They also may only be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulInTheirElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulInTheirElement">Graceful in Their Element</a>, and are (though not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">The Klutz</a>) plodding on land.
</p><p>Note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills">Improbable Piloting Skills</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a> do not guarantee anyone becoming an ace. The most important factor is luck; that is, to actually meet enemies and face them in the air. In WWII, only 50% of American fighter pilots ever met Axis airplanes in the air. On the other hand, in a target-rich environment, such as that which the RAF faced at Malta, <em>any</em> pilot will eventually become an ace if he survives long enough. The second important factor is rank: it must not be too low nor too high. Most kills are scored by flight and squadron leaders. Ranks below First Lieutenant usually serve as wingmen, while Lieutenant Colonel and higher ranks are usually preoccupied with desktop jobs. Many pilots have actually <em>refused</em> promotion in order to be able to fly and score victories.

Sometimes aces prefer to fly together as each others' wingmen. This is known as <em>Fat Cat Flight</em>.
</p><p><strong>Piloting Styles Preferred By Aces</strong>
</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Steamrollers</em> are aggressive types who favor in-your-face frontal assaults, raining fire or blows on their enemy to keep them off-balance. Experienced pilots can almost always dodge a frontal attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">but if you keep pressing the attack, sooner or later they might slip up and take a hit</a>. Because this tactic results in exciting, close-ranged fights with a lot of interplay between the two combatants, this is a particularly popular variant for protagonist aces in fiction.
</li><li> <em>Bushwhackers</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">cunning, devious pilots</a> who eschew easy-to-evade frontal attacks in favor of taking potshots from the rear or other blind spots. When engaged in a duel, they try to wriggle out of it and drop out of the enemy's field of view so they can come in from another direction and catch the foe off-guard. Frequently, bushwhackers will sacrifice spare weapons as decoys, distracting the enemy so they can ambush them from behind (e.g, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">the Picard Maneuver</a>). Most real world Aces are Bushwhackers. Also most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre">Real Robot</a> protagonists are Bushwackers due to the nature of the genre.
</li><li> <em>Snipers</em> are similar to bushwhackers, but rather than using skill to escape a duel, have the accuracy and firepower to end each duel the moment it begins. They hide behind asteroids, colonies, or cloud cover, popping up to take potshots at their targets, and try to avoid close combat and running battles at all costs.
</li><li> <em>Pluggers</em>  for want of a better term  are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">defensive players</a>, who manage to stay calm and collected even under continuing attacks from bushwhackers or steamrollers. By continually dodging and deflecting enemy attacks, they can tie up otherwise dangerous foes in time-wasting sparring matches, and may even be able to sneak in the occasional counterattack. In fiction, this style is typically the province of secondary characters, but there are occasional leads who fit the profile (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> hero Uso Evin).
</li></ul><p>Note that fights against other veterans are usually a better indicator of an ace's style than battles against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, who can generally be taken out with little effort.
</p><p>Another classification, coming from the Finnish Air Force, is differentiating pilots who fly with their "brains" versus pilots who fly with their "muscles". Those who fly with their brains usually have superb mathematical and 3D skills, being able to manage the situation like a computer and form a clearer view of the chaotic scene of battle. They are excellent shots and who do not take unnecessary risks but rather attempt to attack the enemy from his blind spots and break off ASAP. Those who fly with their "muscles" are superb pilots, extremely aggressive, prefer dogfights and maneuvers, and are good with aerobatics but not necessarily crack shots. Either can become aces. "Bushwackers" and "snipers" are "brain" pilots while "steamrollers" and "pluggers" are "muscle" pilots. The difference is best illustrated by the von Richthofen brothers: Manfred (the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a> with 80 kills) was a "brain" pilot, while his little brother Lothar (with 40 kills) was a "muscle" pilot.
</p><p>Civilian examples exist as well, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDriver">not just for aircraft</a>. While civilian pilots, obviously, don't <em>technically</em> meet the military definition because the goal of civilian flight is to <em>not</em> kill people (which means most who weren't military before do not have kills), some civilian pilots have saved lives and property with overwhelming skill and capability, overcoming multiple engine failures, hydraulic failures, or <em>many</em> other incidents which would fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a>.

Nevertheless, through training and battles he became a true ace). However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Tetsuya Tsurugi</a> not only was trained into it before the series but also he is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> - and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> - of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> ace pilots in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> anime.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> franchise has a bunch, and an interesting tradition of the best pilot in each show <em>not</em> being the main character:
<ul><li> Max Jenius in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, and Milia Fallyna on the other side, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectingForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectingForLove">the two fell in love</a> and she defected. Max takes this to such an extent that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed him to be <em>the</em> best pilot in the franchise, bar none. Even when in his fifties and with somewhat "rusty" piloting skills in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em>, he still outperforms every other Ace in the series <em>combined</em> when he hops in a fighter.
<ul><li> While not the absolute best, protagonist Hikaru Ichijo was an extremely skilled pilot as well, as was his squad leader, Roy Focker.
</li></ul></li><li> Sylvie Gina and Nexx Gilbert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossII">Macross II</a></em> (The main character, Hibiki Kanzaki, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Ace Reporter</a> flying unarmed civilian craft instead).

Their main rivals DD Ivanov and Nora Polyansky are no slouches either, DD especially having <em>trained</em> Roy, and clearly a superior fighter.
</li><li> Ozma Lee in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> is SMS's best pilot, and possibly in the entire <em>Frontier</em> fleet; even near the end of the show, he is still able to out-duel main hero Alto Saotome by a couple of points due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">much greater experience</a> and Alto being quite conflicted at the time. Michel, meanwhile, was the company's ace <em>sniper</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has two main examples, Kururugi Suzaku for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Britannia</a> and Kallen Stadtfeld/Kozuki for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Black Knights</a>. Several others can be considered above average such as some of the Knights of the Round, and some of the Black Knights, but none of them hold a candle to the above two.
<ul><li> Kallen Stadtfeld is a definite steamroller, which is required because her only useful weapon is close-range, which means that she has to be aggressive in order to survive. Even when she gets long-range attacks, she sticks to this in most cases. Suzaku himself has noted that even with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch's geass command to "live" placed on him</span>, he cannot beat Kallen, implying that she is arguably the best pilot in the Code Geass universe.
</li><li> In an odd case of "Unstoppable force meets Immovable Object", Suzaku Kururugi uses the same strategy, even though he uses a well-rounded machine not nearly as suited to it as hers is. But Suzaku, being Suzaku, simply fails to capitalize on this in areas that his opponents lack... unless he's on a mission. This is particularly telling with any battle where he and Kallen clash, save when emotions get in the way.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">not exactly an exceptionally skilled pilot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">Lelouch</a> is a definite Sniper: while the Burai he used at the beginning is a mook with some cosmetic modifications, his later Knightmares - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Gawain</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Shinkiro</a> - have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">brutal long-range firepower and next to no close-range fighting capability</a>.

She's not really <em>amazingly good</em>, though, so much as <em>always reliable</em>, and in the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot">Real Robot</a> series that counts for a lot more. In one episode, her "forward" points out that her reaction time is worse than Ohta's, but her motions are more efficient (Ohta will start moving first, but Izumi will complete the action first).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em> has Nanoha in a high-ranking position in an alien air-force, the lack of planes not being an issue when you can fly without them. In fact, her official in-show nickname is "Ace of Aces". Her combat style is <em>steamroller</em>. It is worth noting that mages in <em>Nanoha</em> have strong shields, and mentally-guided projectiles help with aiming, so it's more a matter of "breaking through their shields with brute force" than "hoping they'll slip up and take a hit". The one ace Nanoha has never beaten in a square fight is Signum. She's the ultimate <em>plugger</em>, wearing down her enemies with a strong defense before unleashing her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Sword</a>.
</li><li> The various versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> feature many aces among the mercenary pilots, including protagonist Shin Kazama, his friend Mickey Simon, and base commander Saki Vashtal.

With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEars">animal ears</a>. And no pants. In terms of tactics, most of them appear to be Bushwhackers or Steamrollers, while Sanya and Lynette are Snipers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer">Overman King Gainer</a></em> has three main ace pilots Gainer Sanga, Gain Bijou, and Cynthia Lane.

</li><li> Similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> example above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> has plenty of aces among the Otome.

Interesting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Dilandua and his henchmen are clearly Bushwackers and Snipers, using stealth technology and advanced ranged weaponry to try to overwhelm the heroes rather than going toe to toe with them. Given the themes of honour and chivalry in the show, this contrast is more than a little thematically appropriate.

His fighting style is a Plugger as he usually just turtles until the opponent gets tired out but that's because he's just using the fight as nothing more than a training exercise.

As expected of a Sci-Fi War Drama of sorts, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise have a palette of these:
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, of course, had Amuro Ray and Char Aznable, as well as a succession of other Zeon aces such as Ramba Ral and the Black Tri-Stars.
<ul><li> Amuro is almost too much of an Ace Pilot for his own good; his general skill, coupled with his experience and emerging Newtype abilities, basically means that the RX-78-2 actually starts LIMITING him after a while. Only after it is given an upgrade- in the form of magnetic coating for the suit's joints, increasing reaction speed- does the suit truly match its pilot.
</li><li> For all his acrobatics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Char</a> mostly sticks to steamroller and sniper tactics. He initially suffers the same limitations as Amuro, but we don't see it easily as not only does he get to change suits regularly, he also customizes them thoroughly (a freedom Amuro doesn't always have).
</li><li> Amuro embodies traits from all four ace types in one way or another. When he first starts, he's mostly a Steamroller, relying on the Gundam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">superior firepower and armor</a> to overwhelm his enemies. However, as Zeon manages to close the technology gap, Amuro began evolving into more of a Sniper, and especially a Bushwacker. His gambit of sacrificing the Gundam in the final battle of the original series to get an opening to take out Char's Zeong is probably the ultimate example of the Bushwacker mindset.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Nu Gundam</a>, with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">fin funnels</a> and assortment of weaponry, gives Amuro even more ways to attack his enemies, meaning he can barely be touched, much less beaten, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Char</a> is no longer a proper match for him. This version of Amuro is considered by fans to be the greatest Gundam Ace in the franchise, bar none.
</li></ul></li><li> Char's second coming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Full Frontal</a>, is primarily also a steamroller who shows that his performance on the field isn't just because of the Sinanju, but he is also shown to be more adaptive, pulling Bushwhacker tricks with his utilization of the debris field and his own propellant tanks to throw off the Unicorn and the Londo Bell MS Team.
<ul><li> One minor character, Robin Diez, proves to be a bushwhacker, using his Byarlant Custom's mobility to quickly annihilates at least ten Zeon units invading Torrington base, at a point when the Zeon's had already decimated the base's defenses.
</li></ul></li><li> The side stories from the One Year War give us many more aces of the One Year War and beyond, with pilots like Shin Matsunaga, Johnny Ridden, Anavel Gato, Agar, Lydo Wolf and Ken Bederstadt who all get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">awesome names</a> and back stories that tell of their skills. There are many more names, but props really just have to be given to the Zeon and EFSF's highest scoring aces, Breniff Oguz and Tenneth Jung, both of whom are snipers.
</li><li> It's mentioned in OVA like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> that a good deal of mobile suit aces were also fighter pilots before getting their hands on a suit. As for the main villain and the lead, Gato is clearly a sneaky bastard Bushwacker - he uses spare weapons as decoys, and loves to somersault over his opponent to attack them from behind. For his part, Kou Uraki tends to stay on the defensive, making him a plugger. Kou's saving grace here is his superb reaction speed - every time Gato takes a swipe at him, he comes up with a last-minute defensive manuver, or sacrifices part of his Gundam to deflect the blow. This pretty much nullifies Gato's attempts to catch him off guard, since he can always save himself at the last split second.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em>'s main character Kamille is arguably not the best pilot, since he draws a lot of strength from his Newtype powers. Camille is a textbook Sniper, and often has to be bailed out by his teammates when he gets stuck in a duel and can't get away to launch surprise sniper attacks. Char/Quattro might be number one here. Also of note is Yazan Gable, a near-inhumanly skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> of a Bushwhacker who makes up for his lack of Newtype powers through low cunning and sheer brutality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Gundam ZZ</a></em>'s main cast also relies on Newtype powers for the most part. It's hard to find a good pilot who isn't equipped with an overpowered suit or Newtype powers, but Elle Vianno, Judau's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">fourteen-year-old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>, manages to be an astonishingly capable Plugger despite piloting the oldest, clunkiest suits on the Argama. There's also villainous ace Rakan Dahkaran, who favours heavily armed and armoured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> mobile suits for steamroller tactics. Judau Ashta, the protagonist, is also a steamroller whose tactics involve charging headlong into battle, trusting in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, his piloting skills and his powerful suit (in that order) to carry the day.
</li><li> From both the above series: Haman Karn. Though she spends most of her time politicking rather than fighting, when she does get in a mobile suit, she is <em>dangerous</em>. At the climax of <em>Zeta</em> she defeats Char overwhelmingly (though, to be fair, she had a far more advanced mobile suit) and remains a serious threat throughout <em>ZZ</em>, and even in her final battle, she was holding back roughly half her firepower, and she was still kicking the ZZ Gundam around like a toy for most of it. As a pilot, she combines elements of all four styles due to her unique expertise with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">fin funnels</a>, allowing her to employ whatever strategy works best in a particular situation. Despite that, she's clearly a "brain" pilot, which is contrasted against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Judau</a>, the most muscle-oriented Gundam pilot in the franchise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em> was something of a break from standard Gundam fare in this regard, as none of the protagonists were considered aces even if they were arguably skilled pilots (except for Terry Sanders Jr, who had exactly five kills), and the show goes out of its way to differentiate merely being good and being an actual ace. Though most of the eponymous team are experienced pilots by the end, Norris Packard, the only character to be termed an ace, is in a league of his own. A classic bushwhacker, he was able to take on the entire 08th MS team on his own and keep them on the ropes through creative use of equipment and terrain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIGLOO">MS IGLOO 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Herman Yandell displays Ace <em>tank gunnery (and command)</em>, although his Ace status might be in question as he's mostly known around EFGF tank battalions as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a>, but it counts as he's got the highest score amongst all of them and is the only one to ever return from fighting "The White Ogre" Elmer Snell, who's a Steamroller. Yandell's tactics put him as a Bushwhacker, as he's shown to take advantage of a previous battlefield's environment and its remains, make full use of the tank's extensive loadout and use his own allies to trick the enemy. Likely a necessary thing as pulling a Steamroller on a Zaku with a tank would get one killed.
</li><li> Major Jean Luc Duvall from the first set of <em>MS IGLOO</em> movies was presented as Zimmad Corporation's ace who was sent to show the awesomeness of the Zudah. He certainly moves like an ace, of which kind I'm not sure, since he struck at the Ball and GM teams like a Steamroller, then ran and forced the GMs to chase him and burn out their own engines before blowing up himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Umon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam">Crossbone Gundam</a></em> is notable for two reasons - firstly, he made ace in a single battle during the OYW by destroying six Doms. Secondly, he pulled this feat off while piloting a <em>Ball</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>: Usso Evin, despite being 13 years old, favored bushwacking tactics because he primarily took part in guerrilla warfare, wishes to avoid killing if possible, and because by that point (UC 153) weapons are so powerful that a <em>single</em> hit from a beam rifle is enough to destroy a mobile suit (provided it hits the torso containing the nuclear reactor and the cockpit). Nevertheless, he cemented his ace pilot status by using all other styles at least once and regularly defeating superior numbers thanks to the sheer tactical adaptability and creativity that he displayed (with ideas such as creating a small <em>tsunami</em> to use as a decoy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> is filled with obvious elite pilots, though they are more Martial Artists from Hell than real pilots. (Still, most notable are probably Domon, Master Asia and Schwarz).
<ul><li> On the main G-Gundam cast, Domon and Chibodee are Steamrollers, Sai Saici and Schwarz had some Bushwhacker tendencies, George De Sand is a mix of Bushwhacker and Sniper due to having long-range weapons, and Argo is a Plugger, piloting a heavily armored Gundam that can take much damage.
</li><li> While many of the Gundam Fighters are usually Steamrollers, Gentle Chapman of Neo England stands out as a Sniper. There is a good reason he won the Gundam Fight three times, and lost only to Master Asia, a mix of Steamroller and a Bushwhacker, because of the latter's piloting skills.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title probably has to be given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Rent-a-Char</a> Zechs Merquise/Milliardo Peacecraft. He is able to pilot some of the most challenging mobile suits in the series and can stand toe-to-toe with Gundams in straight combat. He is able to bring main character Heero to a draw in duels as often as he loses to him (and keep in mind, the Gundam pilots had standing orders to kill all witnesses). He earned his title of <em>The Lightning Count</em> after crushing a terrorist opposition force in under a minute.
</li><li> Lucrezia Noin is also incredibly notable in this category. She's a Plugger, through and through, yet is often almost outright stated to have been holding back whenever Zechs is around. Combined with the fact that she's always a tech level or three below the enemy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1esm0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1esm0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1esm0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In an Aries when the enemies are Gundams, in a Taurus when everyone else around her are in Gundams or brand-new-generations-ahead-mobile-suits</span>, and the fact that Noin always <em>survives without being taken out of the fight</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2trtk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2trtk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2trtk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Beyond her first appearance, anyhow</span>... and you have a pilot who might as well be <em>the most skilled character in the damned show</em>.
</li><li> There's also Treize Khushrenada, who goes into battle near the end of the series with a straight copy of the by then hopelessly obsolete Tallgeese. He duels Wufei's upgraded Altron Gundam and more than holds his own, to the point that he only lost because he <em>threw the fight</em>. On the other hand, Wufei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a> personality flat out prevented him from using his own Gundam to its full potential, acknowledging Treize's mech's limitations and refusing to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWeapons">Dragons.</a> He insisted on fighting Treize on no less than equal ground.
</li><li> From the Gundam Pilots themselves, we can deduce that Duo is a Bushwhacker (stealth attacks), Quatre is a Plugger (heavily armored Gundam that can take punishment), Wufei a Steamroller (melee-oriented Gundam that needs to get close to its enemies), Trowa a Sniper (long-range oriented). Heero freely mixed the four pilot archetypes but is mostly a Bushwhacker and a Sniper.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">Gundam X</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> duo, the Frost brothers, often serve the role as <em>Pluggers</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Garrod</a> is mostly a steamroller, albeit an incredibly adaptable one. There's also Lancerow Dowell, the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a>.
</li><li> Loran of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> is either a Bushwhacker or a Plugger depending on the situation. It's actually his <em>lack</em> of kills that best mark his being an Ace—while there are plenty of pilots who fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> category, Loran manages to defeat his opponents without killing any of them until the series is almost over. Even then, he racks up a grand total of two kills over fifty episodes. He manages this in spite of having fallen into the cockpit of the most powerful mobile suit that humanity ever built (and as we see from its brief capture and from the performance of its counterpart, the Turn X, it is <em>terrifying</em> in the hands of someone less scrupulous than him).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kira Yamato is the best and most infamous pilot in the show and its sequel thanks to his in-universe creation as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">Perfect</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Coordinator</a>. He is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>, who is capable of fighting armies and who rarely if ever loses. There is a reason the opposing side is usually terrified of him, other than his best friend and one of the only other Aces who can stand a chance against him, Athrun Zala. Kira starts off being a Bushwhacker in the Strike Gundam and its variable backpacks, but graduates into a Sniper after acquiring the Freedom Gundam and its OP auto-lockon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a>. Let's not even get started with the Strike Freedom.
</li><li> There's also Mu La Flaga, who holds his own against genetically-engineered Coordinators in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">Bigger Stick</a> mobile suits even though he himself is an unmodified Natural piloting either made-of-cardboard mobile armors and fighter jets or hand-me-down mecha.
</li><li> Mu's rival, Rau Le Creuset is a Sniper, who can take on more or less any member of the cast, including Kira. His final ride, ZGMF-X13A Providence, plays directly to his strengths, allowing him to strike from a distance with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drones</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shinn seems to use Bushwhacker tactics when using Force or Blast Impulse, and switches to Steamroller ones when using Sword Impulse or the eponymous Destiny G.
</li><li> Athrun is a Plugger, which causes people to doubt his skill compared to Kira or Shinn (despite him having defeated both of them at various points) because Athrun can spend an entire battle finding an enemy Gundam and dueling with it, while Kira and Shinn start tearing apart grunts left and right. This makes Shinn in particular think Athrun is far inferior to him because Shinn's personal kill count is might higher, only for Athrun to soundly stomp him when they fight later on. Though in Destiny Athrun's skills do take a nosedive when he's fighting someone he's doesn't want to, such as Orb forces or Kira.
</li><li> Not to be outdone, the Cosmic Era has its own share of side stories with aces to show off, such as Sven Cal Bayan, who seems to share Char's indirect steamroller manoeuvres and Edward "the Ripper" Harrelson, who was a very close combat focused steamroller, even before the Earth Alliance got mobile suits. One character of note here, is Shiho Hahnenfuss, the only MSV pilot to have had an appearance before the MSV were even made (first seen in episode 48 of SEED). The few appearances of her indicate that she's a steamroller and she's crossed swords at least once with EAF ace Rena Imelia.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Four Gundam Meisters are actually neatly divided up into the four categories:
<ul><li> Setsuna F. Seiei is a decided Steamroller in the first season, what with even being willing to throw any of his seven blades at the enemy to get a chance at them. He's arguably mixed with a Bushwhacker in the second season, but still retains his 'suicidal attack' method.
</li><li> Allelujah Haptism is a Bushwacker, generally relying on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Kyrios/Arios's</a> superior speed to run circles around his enemies.
</li><li> Lockon Stratos, as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">name implies</a>, is a dedicated Sniper.
</li><li> Tieria Arde is very much a Plugger, with his preference for mecha loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFGs</a> that can take a considerable pounding and give it right back with interest.
</li></ul></li><li> Graham Aker is also an excellent example of a steamroller from the same show, as he is capable of taking one of the most screwed-over and patched-together units ever with only a single melee weapon, and wiping out a vastly superior opponent in his final fight of the season. Admittedly, he did this at the expense of his own unit, but hey. A win is a win.
</li><li> Then there's the series' resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Ax-Crazy mercenary</a> Ali Al-Saachez: A man who has been able to duke it out against Exia with a near-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> Enact, for starters.

<ul><li> Flit Asuno matures into one by the end of his arc, and he continues to be badass throughout the series, even as he ages.
</li><li> We also have Woolf Enneacle in the first and second arcs, notable for making X-Rounders look like idiots despite <em>not</em> being one himself.
</li><li> The preeminent example here is Asem "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Super Pilot</a>" Asuno. Like Woolf, not an X-Rounder, but by the end of his arc he is unquestionably the most skilled pilot in the series, only failing to beat his opponent when faced with a massive tech difference.
</li><li> The antagonist side has the Gallete brothers, Desil and Zeheart. Desil is more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> steamroller, while Zeheart is one of the few pilots in the series who can fight Asemu one-on-one and not expect to be toasted.

</li><li> The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a>, Mask, is of the Steamroller variety, using his Mack Knife's firepower to overwhelm opponents.
</li><li> Similarly, Klim is a Steamroller, but this tactic proved to be a problem when faced against...
</li><li> Dellensen Samatar who managed to damage Klim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> mobile suit with an older mobile suit.

<ul><li> Mikazuki Augus for the Tekkadan side. He is usually a Steamroller in battle, never flinching back at attacking his enemy.
</li><li> On the other side, McGillis Fareed is so far seen as a Plugger. He uses this tactic against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his former team-mate Gaelio Bauduin</span> despite the fact that the latter's mobile suit has better weapons.
<ul><li> In his last ever sortie (the penultimate episode of Season 2), he switches to a Steamroller style, disabling enemy MS (and one Halfbeaks-class ship) left and right.
</li></ul></li><li> By the time season 2 comes around, Vidar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is actually Gaelio Bauduin under a mask</span> is a Plugger, using his Gundam's increased mobility <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which, thanks to his newly installed AV Type E system, he can take full advantage of without any of the drawbacks</span> (and sub-arm-mounted shields later on) to deflect and evade any and all enemy attacks. Hell, he gave Mikazuki a hard time while fighting him. When the boy who destroyed the mobile armor Hashmal singlehandedly can barely land a good hit on you, yep. You're pretty much an ace.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Han Solo flies around in what seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">junky ship</a>, hardly able to fly, and yet he manages to evade and confuse Imperial fleets, while wittily insulting C-3PO and flirting up the Princess. The Millennium Falcon is often referenced as one of the better in the galaxy: it looks like a scrap heap because Han believes functionality is more important than looks. But regardless of the upgrades, the fact that Han outflies fighters in a transport remains very impressive.
</li><li> Luke Skywalker, who has a Death Star to his credit in his first time flying an X-wing.
</li><li> Luke's father Anakin Skywalker, who was outflying professional fighter pilots by the time he was 9! Obi-Wan referred to him as "the best star-pilot in the galaxy". He only gets to show off his skills once in the original trilogy (as Darth Vader in the attack against the first Death Star), but shines more in the prequels.
<ul><li> Special mention goes to an the incident in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> where Anakin pilots General Grievous's flagship to a crash landing on Coruscant. The film makes it look like a simple, if rather large crash. The novelization explains exactly how much work Anakin was doing to keep the ship from breaking up, including using the Force to open and close hatches to tweak its descent by <em>millimeters</em>. Keep in mind this is something the size of a Star Destroyer with <em>no engines</em>. It's justly considered his greatest feat of piloting.
</li></ul></li><li> Wedge Antilles one-ups Luke: He has <em>two</em> Death Stars on his plane. (Luke was doing something more important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">during the second one</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">nonetheless</a>.) Wedge's first silhouette is because he attacked the place and lived to tell about it, something that can only be claimed by two other people: Luke Skywalker and Keyan Farlander, both of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> (the latter is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessProtagonist">Featureless Protagonist</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing">X-Wing</a></em> video games) and both of whom are <em>also</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce">Force-sensitive</a>. Wedge really does deserve some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> points here. Aside from the two Death Stars he also has so many fighter kills that his ground crew chief switched to painting on kill marks for whole squadrons instead of single ships because he ran out of room on the X-Wing's flank.
</li><li> Lando Calrissian, the Millennium Falcon's previous owner, who also helped fight the second Death Star.
</li><li> Poe Dameron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> is described in the opening crawl as one of the Resistance's best pilots. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he comes back with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a> after being presumed dead, he Steamrollers ten TIE fighters in ten seconds, making him possibly the most literal "instant ace" in the franchise! Also, when sprung from the brig on a First Order Star Destroyer and asked if he can fly a TIE Fighter to get them off the ship, he responds that he can fly anything. He proves this right by having instantly figuring out the controls of a fighter he's never flown before, and even instructing Finn on how to operate the controls of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack">back-seat turret</a> despite only getting a brief glimpse at those controls while climbing into the pilot seat.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> Rey steals a starship that hasn't flown in decades (and was basically falling apart before it was abandoned) and absolutely embarrasses several TIE fighter pilots while navigating through a junkyard on Jakku. And she does it all without a copilot, which Han never managed. Justified in that she is later revealed to have latent Force powers.
</li><li> Kylo Ren proves to be a pretty damn good pilot himself during the pursuit of the Resistance fleet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>. Pretty appropriate considering that he's related to three of the other aces on this page. He leads an assault on the Resistance's flagship and comes through unscathed despite the heavy crossfire. Kylo Ren takes out the Resistance's entire complement of x-wings with one missile, completely crippling their ability to fight back. Then, he gets a clear shot at the bridge of the flagship, and would have taken out the Resistance's entire senior leadership, if not for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Force and the fact that his mother was on the bridge.</span>

They were doing stuff back in the Fifties that would make Travis Pastrana wet his pants even today. Made even more awesome because it's <em>all true</em>.

Iceman in particular is described as a Steamroller. To paraphrase Goose, he just stays on you and harries you until you make a mistake. Viper and Jester at one point collaborate as a Plugger and Bushwhacker/Sniper respectively, with Viper drawing Maverick off while Jester sneaks up on him from behind. Maverick doesn't really have any single style since he flies almost entirely on instinct, even stating at one point, "You think, you're dead."

The first of the <em>Wraith Squadron</em> sub-series has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">New Meat</a> pilots ask Wes Janson and Wedge who was the best pilot they ever flew with: the two of them reminisce at length about skilled pilots who died due to bad luck, and others like Skywalker who had incredible skills but moved on to other things. Wes concludes that the only real way to objectively measure pilot skill is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyCountCompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyCountCompetition">total kill count</a> and survivability, making Wedge Antilles (the only pilot to survive both Death Star runs) <em>the</em> best pilot in history. Wedge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">naturally</a>, demurs. All sorts of pilot types, <em>especially</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>, make appearances, and there are discussions of the five-kill rule, becoming an "instant ace", rivalries between pilots, and many more. Demonstrations of styles include:
<ul><li> Wes Janson - Definite Sniper, though with better dogfighting skills than the typical Sniper. He's a sniper with <em>any</em> ranged weapon, in or out of the cockpit. Most of the time he doesn't even need sights; he can tell with his eyes alone when an enemy is in his line of fire, whether they're a TIE Fighter a kilometer away in a dogfight or Stormtroopers to both sides of him while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual-wielding blaster pilosts</a>.
</li><li> Wedge Antilles - Most likely Steamroller. Against most opponents, he's simply too good to be nailed down to a particular tactic, but when the enemy has him boxed up, he tends to get increasingly daring. Further, his save of Luke, in the original movie, is pure steamroller. He's noticed his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>, and at the start of the series the kill silhouettes painted on his X-Wing include two Death Stars and an alarming number of other big ships. He's shot down so many starfighters by that point that a mechanic apologizes for not being able to fit them all into the space allotted, and had to render some in red, marking a squadron's worth of kills. Being Wedge, it makes no difference to him how his kills are grouped; he never brags about being one of the best pilots in history. <br/><br/>He's shown to have a strange grasp on what his opponents are thinking and what they'll do - before they do it. It's powerful enough that he once calls it "precognitive", though immediately after that he chalks it up to pure pattern-recognition gained through endless hours of experience. Wedge also has the ability to think incredibly fast in high stress situations, taking the circumstances in and making a complicated decision in a second or less. This has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">nothing to do</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForce">The Force</a>.
</li><li> Wedge has a counterpart in his brother-in-law <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> Baron Fel, who is the page image. Fel is skilled enough that it's canon he reestablishes the Empire...
</li><li> Tycho Celchu - Probably Bushwhacker. His flying style is <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Quote:Tycho_Celchu#I.2C_Jedi">described<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by a Force-sensitive opponent (who is also a phenomenal pilot) as being incredibly complex, with him constantly thinking of ways to box in the enemy, anticipating his moves, and potential paths out of the line of fire and back to a position behind the enemy. Wedge once says, "You see a target coming in, you see him launch missiles, choose one vector for him and fire in that direction. One time in ten you'll choose right and you'll vape him. Unless you're Tycho Celchu, when it's one time in four."
</li><li> Derek "Hobbie" Klivian is a pilot known for his remarkable skill at surviving, despite runs of bad luck; few of his tactics are seen, but his ability to keep alive, turning even lethal shots into hits that allow him to eject and recover, may be evidence of being of Plugger.
</li><li> There are plenty of other pilots, but those illustrate the styles best. Another EU book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em>, makes it clear that Darth Vader doesn't really fit any category, except perhaps the double-secret probationary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills">Sniperollbushplugwhacker</a>. He was able to make the <em>second</em> best Imperial pilot, pictured above, who is good enough to make a decent protagonist pilot feel like a child who can barely walk trying to keep up with a champion distance runner, look like a clueless farmboy. Casually. Without using a targeting computer, which, the protagonist believes, is outright <em>impossible</em>. The Force—and to be completely accurate, thirty-plus years of experience and ageless cybernetic components—helps pilots, clearly. Another thing to take into account is just how much of Vader's body is cybernetic. Think about how a pilot experiences extreme movement of blood from the extremities to the brain during strenuous maneuvers. Now think about a pilot without extremities, whose body doesn't have the same necessities as a typical human. And give him the power of the force. In <em>Death Star</em>, after flying against Vader in practice the top TIE pilot on the station narrates that, if he ever ends up on the wrong end of Vader's guns for real, he'll just self-destruct his ship to save time.
</li><li> Special mention goes to Kell Tainer, an ex-mechanic whose expertise stems from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">detailed knowledge of his fighter's systems and capabilities</a>. On several occasions, he can perform on-the-fly analysis of damage to his or other pilots' fighters, can direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">precision strikes</a> on enemy capital ships, and push the technical limits of his ship as far as it'll go. His most noteworthy performance is attempting to <em>ram</em> an allied fighter out of a terminal dive; although he failed to save her, his sheer nerve and improvisation earned him awards.
</li><li> Luke Skywalker gets another mention here. In total piloting ability, he's in the same neighborhood as his father, and in some books he's shown racking up an impressive count of enemy fighters. Part of this ability, of course, comes from being a Jedi, and his ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">use the Force to augment his senses</a> pushes his piloting ability far beyond what his purely mundane skills would allow. Even before receiving Jedi training, however, he was a highly-skilled bush pilot.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>' ninth book, <em>Starfighters of Adumar</em>, the titular planet is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a> where Ace Pilots are the elite of society. But since it's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> which sees no point in simulator practice, and the attrition rates of new pilots are appalling, none of them are very skilled. Even those with obvious native talent rarely live long enough to become truly skilled. This means that when the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant send their best pilots alive there on a diplomatic function, said pilots are all but worshiped. And subject to endless attempts to kill them for their status.
</li><li> Another special mention should go to Wedge's eldest daughter, Syal Antilles, who manages to fight Luke Skywalker to a standstill in a dogfight. <em>Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker</em>. That's a feat few, if <em>anyone</em> else, can put on their record.

But by the second book, with all the insane wacky piloting he does, no one's doubting the truth behind that statement.

The result? A massive shotgun blast that cripples the alien armada, forcing it to retreat even before the capital ships arrive. This becomes a standard tactic in later books. Gray is also notable for coming from a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Prim</a>" background, having grown up in the flooded ruins of Manhattan with no modern technology. Gray ends up not only surviving to become an admiral twenty years later, but also engages in negotiations with the Sh'daar Masters, which results in a ceasefire. It's actually not uncommon for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighter</a> pilots to have capital ship kills on their record, considering their standard armament includes dozens of powerful nuclear missiles, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapon">KK cannon</a>, and a particle beam projector.

The revised d20 edition had <em>two</em>: the Ace Pilot and the Jedi Ace. And since the Ace Pilot had 10 levels and the Jedi Ace had 5, the <em>really dedicated</em> Force-sensitive pilot character could max out both.
</li><li> <em>Ace of Aces</em> was a game which simulated combat between two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> biplanes using only two matching books, each filled with views of the opponent, seen from the cockpit of the player's plane. The players selected their next move, exchanged numbers and ended up on a new page showing the result. If a player choose badly, this could be a shot of incoming machine-gun fire.

'Ace' pilots (those who have scored five kills) have a better pilot skill rating (generally 3+ or 2+ instead of 4+ or 3+) and thus a better chance of not dying. And then you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Nightwing</a> squadron of four planes that shot down sixty six hostile fighters in one engagement. Technically impossible under the AI rules because a Nightwing has enough ammo to down only nine fighters before being forced to disengage (and you'd have to be really lucky to pull it off anyway), but possible using the Apocalypse rules.
<ul><li> In the main 40K game, you can buy Ork Dakkajet planes an ace pilot, known as a "Flyboss", who has survived more dogfights than he can count (i.e. six or more). This increases his Ballistic Skill rating when shooting at aircraft and skimmers to a princely 3, the same as the average human infantryman.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> RPG setting two of the options for a Voidmaster's special ability are ace pilots (either for large starships or space fighters). The Flight Marshal alternate career rank allows a Voidmaster to become even more of an Ace Pilot. Oddly enough, rules for fighter combat (as opposed to deploying entire squadrons) weren't added until much later.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a> also has pilot skill ratings along with gunnery skills for marksmanship.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SystemsMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SystemsMalfunction">Systems Malfunction</a></em> tabletop game, the "Vehicle Expertise" and "Ace" perks allow characters to become ace pilots of the vehicle of their choice. In the LARP, the Pilot class allows characters to be ace pilots of Mini-Mecha and/or remote-piloted drones.

The Aces among Aces, however, are those with Pilot Skill 9. There are only nine characters with Pilot Skill 9: Darth Vader (TIE Advanced), Soontir Fel (TIE Interceptor), "Quickdraw" (TIE/SF), Han Solo (YT-1300 - and has two cards with different talents), Wedge Antilles (X-Wing), one version of Poe Dameron (T-70 X-Wing), Talonbane Cobra (Kihraxz Fighter), Dengar (Jumpmaster 5000), and Fenn Rau (Protectorate Starfighter). Amusingly enough, since Pilot Skill is used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative">Action Initiative</a>, this means that unless he's up against one of the others mentioned, Han is virtually guaranteed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">shoot first</a>. In terms of the piloting styles, jouster lists lean towards Steamrollers to rip enemy ships apart as quickly as possible, arc-dodger lists favour Bushwhackers to evade enemy lines of fire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">slowly wear down enemies who can't actually respond</a>, and turret lists like big, durable Pluggers who can soak up arc-dodgers' low damage output and don't really care much about fire arcs. Most of the above aces are Steamrollers who specialise in dealing lots of damage quickly (Vader, Poe, Quickdraw, Dengar, Talonbane Cobra and Wedge); Han is a Plugger with some useful tricks first and foremost, Soontir is a Bushwhacker, and Fenn Rau can either fight like a Bushwhacker or Steamroller depending on how you fly him (although Bushwhacking with him tends to keep the pressure off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> ship).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warbirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warbirds">Warbirds</a></em> RPG is focused on the player characters being mercenary fighter pilots in a setting where that role is analogous to "rock star who shoots people". Bluntly, if you're not a skilled pilot, you're probably an NPC. In the Guild, anyone with ten dogfighting kills is a "dogfight ace", while ten strafing kills is a "strafing ace"; there are certain plane upgrades you can only take if you've reached this status, and some require you to have fifty in one category (an "Elite Ace") - you get free plane upgrades as your killcount rises, although if it gets shot down you need to start over or drop a lot of money on getting your kite back up to scratch.

Also anyone with a last name that ends in -stein (Branstein, Garstein). Which makes Elzam (a Branstein and an Aggressor) <em>wicked awesome</em>.
</li><li> There's also the ATX team in which during the first game Kyosuke, Excellen and Bullet are at the same level if not surpassing the Aggressors to the point where Sanger Zonvolt (another Aggressor and arguably most badass in the OG verse so far) believes they have a better chance of beating the aliens than HE does.
</li><li> In fact nearly everyone on your team is an Ace Pilot either by insane skill (ATX, Aggressors, Axel, Irm and Ring), developed Telekinesis abilities (Ryusei, Aya, Kusuha and company) or by being the only pilots capable of operating unique and extremely powerful machines (Masaki, Lune, Kouta, Folka etc). Really the reason the OG group is so unbeatable is because they have nearly every Ace in the EFA in one group.
</li><li> Also, in many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> games, once a pilot racks up 50 or more kills in a playthrough, they're given the status of "Ace", which gives various advantages depending on the game and character, ranging from slightly higher starting morale (Which is necessary for unleashing their most powerful attacks) to all manner of dodge and damage bonuses. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW">Super Robot Wars W</a></em> takes this even further with W (pronounced Double) Ace status upon reaching 100 kills, and gives an even more dramatic bonus.

In the first game, he dives from orbit to drop an armoured vehicle on a landing strip <em>30 metres</em> long and then pull up to escape back into orbit, while under continuous heavy fire, one one motion. The <em>Normandy</em> is not damaged. Oh, and the very minimum 'safe' landing zone to make a drop in, according to Alliance regulations? 100 metres. Joker is quite literally the best pilot in the Alliance. Notable in that his craft isn't a fighter like is common for the trope, but a 100+ meter frigate. And he still makes it do tricks that one would expect more from a fighter craft.

In the <em>Citadel</em> DLC, a rogue mercenary gang steals the <em>Normandy SR-2</em>. While Shepard infiltrates the ship, Cortez has to prevent it from jumping to FTL by literally blocking it; repeatedly flying within a 30-degree cone of its line of travel will trip the jump safeties and keep the mercenaries from fleeing. It also exposes Cortez to the <em>SR-2</em>'s formidable main weapons, so he has to continuously duck in and out of the line of fire, keeping up with the frigate's course changes and dodging skyscrapers. Cortez accomplishes this feat <em>in a taxi</em>.

Most of these are from the two World Wars, for obvious reasons. Some, however, are from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">ArabIsraeli Conflict</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>. We have yet to get an ace from the current century, as most current conflicts don't involve air combat. And the few that do involve air combat have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp Battles</a>, where the winning side massively outnumbers the loser, leaving far too few kills to go around for anybody to become an ace.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> was Frenchman Céléstin Adolphe Pégoud, the second pilot to perform a loop before World War 1. After he shot down his fifth German plane he was lauded in the French papers as an "ace", which at the time was a general term for someone who had done something heroic or noteworthy. British and American journalists who saw this then generalized that a pilot qualified as an "ace" if he shot down five planes. Pégoud himself racked up another air victory before being shot down himself in 1915.
</li><li> The most famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> ace would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Rittmeister</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">Baron</a> Manfred von Richthofen, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">the</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>. He is <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">ace</a>. In fact, he is usually referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">''ace of aces''</a>, since <em>ace</em> simply wasn't enough (the term "ace" in WWI was derived from anyone who shot down at least five aircraft. Richthofen was officially credited with 80, though he may have downed over 100). Richthofen was killed in 1918 (it's not definitively known who fired the kill shot, as it almost certainly came from the ground rather than from another plane). Considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, the <em>Allies</em> gave him a full military funeral. <br/><br/>Richthofen was a real-life example of the Sniper/Bushwhacker. According to his wingmen, his flying skills were not vastly superior, and he considered his aircraft merely a means to bring his guns to bear. At that point he would deploy his real skills: superb marksmanship and a gift for selecting targets which were not aware of him. At least, not until bullet holes appeared on their planes... <br/><br/>He is perhaps best known for having taken the flamboyant step of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyConspicuousUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyConspicuousUniform">painting his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">aircraft red</a>, sacrificing the element of surprise for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedArmies">instant recognition from wing mates</a>. Despite camouflage being the official rule for aircraft, it was permitted soon enough for other squadrons to have their machines painted with their own unique squadron colors.
</li><li> Manfred's younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen was also an ace pilot with 40 kills. He survived the war, became a commercial pilot and died in a crash in 1922.
<ul><li> <em>Du bist Schläger, kein Jäger!</em> (You are a brawler, not hunter!) - Manfred's ("brain" pilot) opinion of his little brother Lothar ("muscle" pilot)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">Their cousin</a> Wolfram von Richthofen also gained the Ace title with "only" 8 kills (having joined the Air Service much later than his cousins, the war ended only 7 months after Wolfram's first combat flight) and later served in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, where he raised to the rank of Field Marshal and the command of an entire air fleet.
</li></ul></li><li> A very notable earlier one, of whom Richthofen was a pupil, was Oswald Boelcke.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3z0wi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3z0wi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3z0wi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Richthofen, at the time an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyInBack">observer/gunner</a> in a reconnaissance plane, met Boelcke by chance and was recruited by him for pilot training.</span> Boelcke's biggest claim to fame is the <em>Dicta Boelcke</em>, the first manual of air-to-air combat and still relevant today. He was a mixture of a Steamroller and a Bushwhacker, the Dicta holds that a pilot should first seek to achieve surprise or attack from a superior position, then get into combat and stick with it until the other guy is flaming wreckage on the ground. Boelcke was killed in action in 1916.
</li><li> Ditto for Max Immelman, who was a contemporary of Boelcke, was the first pilot to be awarded the Pour le Mérite, Germany's highest medal, (which was nicknamed the "Blue Max" in his honor during WWI) and was an inspiration to Richthofen. And having an aerobatic maneuver (in fact one of the basic ones) named after you doesn't hurt opinions, either. Immelman too was killed in action in 1916.
</li><li> The real life ace with the highest kill count was German Erich "Bubi" Hartmann, with 352 victories credited. He felt his biggest achievement was never losing a wingman. Hartmann was the classic Bushwacker. He once described his own flying style as "Dive - Attack - Run Away - Coffee Break". He also stated that only damage his plane ever suffered in air combat was from destroyed enemy planes' debris. This was in large part because of his style of fighting: He would fly as close as possible before firing. He was known to have said "If you wait until the other plane fills the entire window of the cockpit, you don't waste a single round." <br/><br/>There is a theory that he was able to achieve such a killcount only due to amphetamines — which were invented by Germans specially for the military pilots — due to him being on the front only for a relatively short time, but having a <em>very</em> tight schedule. His logs show as many as <em>eight</em> sorties on a certain day. While each sortie in WWII rarely lasted longer than a couple of hours, those planes didn't really have "power steering", and air combat <em>is</em> one of the most tiring activities known to man. Two sorties per day was the par for the course, three were somewhat tiring, four were a chore, five a burden and six nigh impossible. Eight sorties are widely considered achievable only by using stimulants. <br/><br/>Hartmann fought on the Eastern Front, and attributed his number of victories to the fact that he was often tasked with interception of air-to-ground assault planes flown by novice pilots who were taught to stay in close formations and rarely if ever took evasive actions. See also the Japanese training philosophy explained below as Soviets shared this attitide. However, he also shot down seven U.S.A.A.F. planes engaged in bombing raids on the Romanian oil fields of Ploesti.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>, better known as a bestselling author, was officially credited with 5 kills for England during World War II, but possibly scored more. One incident on his autobiography <em>Going Solo</em> describes an incident where he was cornered alone in his plane against <em>six</em> German bombers, with three crew each, making the encounter 1 vs. 18. With only three minutes before his engine overheated, Dahl managed to shoot down one of them and escape.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Rudel">Hans-Ulrich Rudel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, possibly the most deadly man in an aircraft. He got the <em>Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</em> (an award ranked second only to the <em>Grand Cross of the Iron Cross</em>), the only man who got that. His claims include destroying over 600 vehicles, along with sinking a battleship, two cruisers, four armored trains, and 51 enemy aircraft.
</li><li> Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> was an ace in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, with 22 victories. By the end of the war, he was commander of Jagdgeschwader 1, famous as the Red Baron's "Flying Circus" (he was apparently an unpopular commander, due to being rather arrogant even by fighter pilot standards), and mustered out as a Captain with a number of medals, including the famous Pour le Mérite.
</li><li> René Paul Fonck, Allied ace of aces in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and of all time. His 75 confirmed victories (just short of von Richthofen's count) exceeds the tallies of any allied WWI and WWII pilot, though he claimed up to 140. He was a combo Sniper/Bushwhacker, known to stalk a target before taking it down with a single short machine gun burst. In his own words: "I put my bullets into the target as if I placed them there by hand."
</li><li> The Soviet Union had the only real life female aces: Olga Yamshchikova (17 confirmed kills), Lidia Litvyak (12 confirmed, up to 20 rumored) and Katya Budanova (11 confirmed, up to 14 rumored). Litvyak and Budanova were killed in action, while Yamshchikova went to become the USSR's first female jet test pilot.
</li><li> Ilmari Juutilainen, 94 kills, the top Finnish Air Force ace, as well as the highest scoring non-German fighter pilot in WWII. 2 kills in a Fokker D.XXI, 36 kills in a Brewster Buffalo and 56 kills in a Messerschmitt Bf 109G. The first two were <em>highly</em> obsolete when he flew them, and the Brewster Buffalo was never known to be a good airplane at all...though the Finns managed to make them work. He served as an airplane mechanic as a conscript, and went to flight school only after his mandatory military service. He had extremely good both theoretical and practical knowledge on how airplanes behaved and what various plane models could and couldn't do. This was an asset in air combat as he could force the enemy to fight on his own terms. His best day was 30 June 1944 when he shot down six Soviet fighters on one flight. He flew actively after the war as well, and flew for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">last time in the age of 83</a> (Finnish Air Force F-18 Hornet).
</li><li> Douglas Bader. 22 aircraft, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">with two false legs</a>. Badass is an understatement..
</li><li> Alexei Maresyev, with 11 victories, also with two stump legs. Died on the day of a big memorial service in his honour just for spite.
</li><li> One British Hurricane pilot, James MacLachan made ace, then lost an arm to enemy fire. With a false arm, he did it again.
</li><li> Pekka Kokko, Finnish Air Force ace with 12 kills. Lost a leg in air combat and considered to be unfit for combat. What did the Finnish Air Force do? They made him a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">test pilot!</a></em>
</li><li> There are many cases, mostly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, of pilots making "ace in a day" (5 or more on a single sortie). That, for the Americans, usually meant a Medal of Honor. The recordholder was David McCampbell, a USN pilot at Leyte Gulf; nine confirmed and three probable kills in single sortie, a record that remains unequaled. He, however, was already an ace twice over. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman">wingman</a>, Lt. Roy Rushing, scored 7 victories during the same sortie. <br/><br/>One explanation of this comes from a flaw in the Japanese training system: they used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> to produce a small supply of excellent pilots while the Americans used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">Bigger Is Better</a> to produce ten times as many ''good' pilots. The Americans also rotated their experienced pilots home to act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor">Veteran Instructors</a> to new pilots to give them the benefit of their experience while the Japanese pilots remained in combat to be killed off or become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">shell shocked veterans</a>. Thus when the second crop of Japanese pilots came out after Midway they were less trained than their American adversaries, and there were very few skilled veterans still alive to mentor them. When the third crop came out during the attrition-heavy Solomon Islands campaigns, they were almost completely untrained in comparison to the Americans they were facing.
</li><li> Second highest scoring Finnish Air Force ace of WWII, Hans Wind (78 kills), scored "ace in a day" on five separate ocassions - and all within one month! The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman">wingman</a> of Captain Wind was SSgt Nils Katajainen (36 kills). On their last air battle 28 June 1944, they attacked <em>twosome</em> a Soviet air formation of 70+ aircraft and managed it to abandon the bombs. Amazingly, they both survived the feat.
</li><li> Randy "Duke" Cunningham was an American ace during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> (the "hitting the brakes" maneuver from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> was based on one of his tactics), being involved in some of the most known dogfights of that war. He was elected to Congress in 1991. In 2005, he was found guilty of corruption and is currently doing eight years in jail.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wittmann">Michael Wittmann<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> tank ace, known as "The Black Baron". He got 138 tanks and 132 anti-tank guns, before being killed by the <strike>British</strike> <strike> Canadians</strike> either the British or the Canadians (it's disputed) in 1944.
<ul><li> It's important to note that German aces, especially Wittmann, had hilariously overinflated kill counts, as the Germans marked joint kills as full kills for all involved, marked probable kills as full kills, had a much lower barrier to recognize a kill (resulting in many German aces scoring more kills than there existed in the area according to Allied documents), and were typically assigned the kills for their entire unit in action.

He was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">pharmacist</a> by his civilian profession. What did he do after WWII? Returned to home and set up a pharmacy store named <em>Tiger-Apotheke</em>!
</li><li> LaFayette G. Poole, nicknamed "Wardaddy" by his crew, an American tanker serving in France, accounted for over a thousand Germans KIA and a further 250 POW, and 258 German AFV kills, 12 of them being tanks. Al this took place in a time period of <em>81 days in 3 different tanks</em> during 1944. And these aren't just kills claimed. These are the kills confirmed by German operational archives.
</li><li> Eddie Rickenbacker was the American Ace of Aces (most kills) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. His autobiography is one long string of achievements, all told with a humble, "just the facts", style. Before the war, he had already gained fame as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDriver">race car driver.</a> He spent the first part of his time in the Army as an airplane <em>mechanic</em> before managing to get a transfer into the Air Service.
</li><li> Richard Bong got that title for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, getting 40 confirmed kills before it was decided to pull him from the front line. He went into flying test aircraft and died on 6 August 1945. The following day, he <em>shared</em> some front pages with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Bong acknowledged that he was a poor shot, and compensated by aggressively charging in at full speed to shoot his targets up close. This resulted in frequently getting hit by debris from the fighters he destroyed, and one of his probable kills was a plane he collided with. His P-38 Lightning, being far more durable than any Japanese fighter, came out of this accidental ramming just fine.
<ul><li> It's generally accepted that Bong and his rival, Major Thomas Buchanan McGuire (38 confirmed kills), both shot down well over 40 aircraft, and that it's impossible to say who really had the higher score. McGuire died because he was so impatient to catch up with Bong that he took a significant risk during his last battle. About to be pulled from active service too (Bong had already returned to the States), he wanted to make the most of his final mission, so he didn't drop his external tanks before attacking a lone Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa fighter; this would enable him to continue on the flight and find more enemies to shoot down. Unfortunately, the Japanese pilot, Akira Sugimoto, was an ace himself with some 3,000 flight hours on Hayabusa, and McGuire, too low and encumbered by his drop tanks, crashed into the jungle.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bishop">Billy Bishop<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the second-highest-scorer for the entire British Empire in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. Started out as a Steamroller, then changed to a Bushwacker, which he found to be more effective. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a> considered him the most skilled opponent he ever faced and the Germans called him the Hell's Handmaiden for his lethal effectiveness. He was a crack shot, having been a great marksman as a boy in rural Ontario, and was renowned for his keen eyesight. On the other hand, he was a sub-average pilot, crash-landing numerous planes. His official count is 72 victories, just behind the Red Baron for the entire war, yet there has been lingering controversy about whether he simply made up the details of a solo raid that won him the Victoria Cross, the British Commonwealth's highest military award.
</li><li> William Barker, another Canadian, is the most decorated serviceman in the history of the entire British Empire. Also won the Victoria Cross, after he was ambushed by 15 German planes, and fought them to a standstill, bringing down three of them before multiple wounds forced him to crash land directly behind Allied lines.
</li><li> Raymond Collishaw, another Canadian, (must be something in the water, eh?) credited with shooting down 60 aircraft in the First World War, mostly flying triplanes. He supposedly gave away even more kills to bolster the confidence of new pilots. The new pilot would shakily fire a few rounds at a German aircraft, Collishaw would sweep in and fire a quick, efficient burst, and down goes the German. Back on the ground, Collishaw claps the newbie on the back and congratulates him on his first kill.
</li><li> The highest British scorer, Edward "Mick" Mannock (73 kills), was also known for helping his wingmen in this way. He was said to have been blind in one eye, and is believed to have cheated on his pilot's exam. He was also known for his visceral hatred of Germans, and he vocally preferred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkTheLifeboats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkTheLifeboats">machine-gun downed pilots on the ground.</a>
</li><li> One of the most dangerous roles in WWI air-fighting was to shoot down observation balloons. These were protected by antiaircraft batteries and fighter patrols, and were also explosive as they were filled with hydrogen. Several pilots on both sides, however, gained reputations as balloon-busters. The most famous were Willy Coppens of Belgium (37 kills, including 34 balloons) and Frank Luke of the United States (18 kills, including 14 balloons). All Luke's kills were scored in a mere eight days of flying. Sadly, Luke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">very aggressive solo style of flying</a> likely contributed to his death after he attempted to down three balloons in a single sortie before being shot down. His chain of command had been preparing to officially reprimand him for his hotheadedness and lack of team player mindset (pilots who fought alone usually died alone at the hands of pilots who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingMan">fought together</a>), but instead decided to recommend him for the Medal of Honor after his death.
</li><li> Chuck Yeager - who was also the first man to break the sound barrier. Before he did that, his claim to fame was becoming an Ace in one day, and being among the first American pilots to shoot down a jet. He also scored two of his 11.5 official kills (he actually scored at least one more) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging">maneuvering two German pilots into a collision</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Appropriately enough</a>, his name is an Anglicized version of the German <em>Jaeger</em> ("Hunter"). As far as his style, he was a "steamroller" <em>and</em> a "sniper"; he could and did mix it up with the best of them, but also had almost superhuman eyesight that allowed him to hit at longer range with machine guns than most pilots could with cannons. The latter skill was how he took down a jet in his prop-driven P-51.
<ul><li> Like Ilmari Juutilainen did, Charles Yeager still flies actively P-51 Mustang in air shows (in his <em>90s</em>), as does his WWII squadronmate Clarence "Bud" Anderson, a 16 victory ace. They often fly together in formation.
</li></ul></li><li> While we are on the subject of test pilots, Royal Navy Captain Eric "Winkle" Brown, is considered by many to be the greatest test pilot who ever lived. The first man to intentionally land a jet on an aircraft carrier, he logged 2,407 arrested carrier landings and flew 487 different types of aircraft, both records unlikely to ever be exceeded. He is one of the few pilots to fly every significant combat aircraft fielded by all combatants in WWII, Axis and Allied, including all of the operational German jets, and was the only allied test pilot to fly the practically suicidal Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighter under power. He even taught himself how to fly a helicopter with nothing more than a pilot's manual and a stiff drink when he was ordered to ferry one of the the Royal Aircraft Establishment's first Sikorsky <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/R4B" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/R4B">R 4 B</a> Hoverflys to Farborough. And to top it all off he wrote it all up in several books and dozens of magazine articles.
</li><li> Hanna Reitsch, "Die Hanna", could also qualify. She was the official test pilot of the Third Reich, and after the WWII she was very active on soaring, setting many world records. It is claimed only her gender prevented her becoming a "real" WWII fighter ace. Hanna Reitsch and Eric Brown knew each other well - they both had been introduced to aviation by WWI ace Ernst Udet.
</li><li> James Jabara, the first man to become a "jet ace", getting a total of fifteen kills in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> to add to his one-and-a-half from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Numbers five and six, of two MiG-15s were done with one drop tank stuck on his aircraft. He signed up for a tour in Vietnam in 1966, but was killed in a car crash before deploying.
</li><li> Saburo Sakai, the highest-scoring surviving ace of the Japanese Navy, had a career filled with moments that make him worthy of this trope. One was his 800-mile flight, in a damaged plane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">a bullet hole through his head</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4m0ih');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4m0ih" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4m0ih');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He later underwent surgery on the affected eye to restore his vision...<em>without anesthesia.</em></span>, which blinded one eye and paralyzed half of his body. Another was surviving a dogfight with sixteen American planes, better than his own, without a single bullet in his aircraft. And a third was the time a terrified enemy pilot bailed out before Sakai had even fired a shot. During that famed flight of survival, he was near to passing out several times, so he took to intentionally aggravating the pain in his wounds to jolt himself wider awake. Upon arriving at his base, he insisted on reporting to his superior officer before getting medical attention. After the war, Sakai became a devout pacifist, swearing that he would never kill anything again, not even an insect. In his autobiography he claimed his greatest achievement was not shooting down a Dutch airliner, even though it would have been an easy kill, because he saw women and children on board.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Kretschmer">Otto Kretschmer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a German WWII U-boat ace who sank 47 ships for a total of 274,333 tons before being captured by the British in March 1941 in an engagement that led to the death of Joachim Schepke, another ace. This was the most tonnage sunk by any U-Boat commander even though Kretchmer missed out on a significant portion of the Battle of the Atlantic. He survived the war.
</li><li> Günther Prien, another U-Boat ace, who was killed in 1941 attacking a convoy a week before Kretschmer's capture. Before that in 1939, he managed to get publicly praised by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a></em> after sneaking into the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow, <em>sinking a battleship</em> and getting back out before the British worked out what was going on. His closest counterpart in Royal Navy would have been Lieutenant Max Horton, who navigated his submarine to <em>Constantinople harbour</em> to sink a Ottoman Turkish battleship anchored there in WWI. He was promoted to Admiral in WWII.
</li><li> Otto Hersing commanded U 21, which on 5 September 1914 became the first German submarine to sink an enemy warship (the cruiser HMS Pathfinder). He went on to sink two British battleships, HMS Triumph and HMS Majestic, in the Dardanelles in 1916.
</li><li> Otto Weddigen, captain of U 9, sank three British armoured cruisers in 75 minutes on 22 September 1914. He went on to sink another one on 24 October, but died on 18 March 1915 when U 29 was sunk by being rammed by the battleship HMS Dreadnought.
</li><li> The submarine captain credited with sinking the largest enemy tonnage ever was Lothar von Arnauld de la Périère, scion of a Huguenot noble family driven from France by Louis XIV. During World War 1 he sank 194 allied ships totalling 454,000 tons. He was known for taking care to do his best to stop ships before sinking them in order to allow the crews to get into their lifeboats. The highest number of ships sunk was credited to Otto Steinbrink, but his 202 sinkings "only" totalled 232,000 tons.
</li><li> David Wanklyn of HM Submarine Upholder won the VC in the Mediterranean. Credited with 140,000 tons, he was the highest (confirmed) scorer on the Allied side.
</li><li> In the Pacific, USS Wahoo was commanded by "Mush" Morton. Known for his incredible aggression, he was the first sub commander to successfully sink a destroyer with a "down-the-throat" shot. Three of his officers went on to become successful skippers of their own, including Dick O'Kane.
</li><li> Dick O'Kane of USS Tang won the Medal of Honor for his last patrol — by ripping apart a Japanese convoy in a surface night attack, long after even Japanese escorts started carrying radar and making surface attacks incredibly hazardous. While Tang went down in that attack, she was sunk by her own torpedo — otherwise she would have escaped scot-free.
</li><li> Commander Jimmy Launders of the HMS <em>Venturer</em> holds the honorable distinction of being the first and only man ever to sink an enemy submarine while both his and the enemy's ship were submerged. Off the course of Norway on February 9th 1945, the <em>Venturer</em> detected <em>U-864</em>, which was known to have jet engines and V-2 parts destined for Japan onboard. A new vessel, <em>U-864</em> was equipped with a snorkel allowing it to run submerged - a new feat for a submarine of the period. Realizing that the enemy would not surface and thus present him an easy target, Launders and his crew proceeded to do what was thought to be impossible: <em>Mentally calculate a firing solution in four dimensions</em>. Even with their almost impossible math skills, they still had to estimate the submarine's depth and make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> about its evasive maneuvres. This they did, firing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">half their torpedoes</a></em> at the German sub. <em>U-864</em> managed to evade three, but the fourth punctured its pressure hull and imploded it. Had she reached Japan, WWII may have been significantly longer.
</li><li> Luigi Rizzo, also known as The Sinker, was the closest thing Italian MAS (a speedboat with two torpedoes strapped on) Ace. Closest thing because he only sank two ships... Who just happened to be the coastal defence ship SMS <em>Wien</em>, that was being hunted down by the Italian Navy due the damage she was wrecking and was sank while in the supposed safety of Trieste's harbour, and <em>the Austro-Hungarian flagship SMS</em> Szent István<em>, single-handedly ruining the Austro-Hungarian Navy final sortie</em>. And the latter wasn't even on purpose: he was returning to his base after an uneventful patrol when he stumbled on the <em>Szent István</em> and her squadron (consisting of another battleship, a destroyer and six torpedo boats) sailing to join the rest of the Austro-Hungarian battleship fleet for a desperate attack on the Otranto Barrage, so he decided to fire torpedoes before running home to warn about the impending attack, sinking the flagship without the squadron realizing what had hit them and convincing the commander-in-chief Horty (with flag on the other flagship <em>Viribus Unitis</em> leading another squadron) the Italians were waiting for him. Rizzo also took part in the Bakar Mockery, a raid in a supposedly impenetrable harbor <em>80 km in a sheltered waterway</em> named for the raiders leaving behind bottles containing mocking messages of challenge (to try and lure the Austro-Hungarians into an ambush), and the only reason he didn't sink anything is that, after the <em>Wien</em>, the admiralty had deployed torpedo nets against the protests of the ship captains, resulting in his torpedoes being blocked.
</li><li> Though it's not often remembered in the West (due to certain political disagreements in the intervening time) the highest-scoring Allied ace of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was in fact the Russian Ivan Kozhedub with 62 kills. In Soviet times there was a (officially suppressed, as the party line was that Soviet advisors didn't actually take part in combat) rumor that Kozhedub, despite the official orders to the contrary, actually flew combat missions in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, where he was a military advisor, and had another five victories there, becoming one of the very few two-war aces. It couldn't really be confirmed, though.
</li><li> It's widely believed that Kozhedub and the <em>second best</em> Allied ace of WWII, Alexander Pokryshkin (59 kills), have much higher real kill counts due to the way Soviet scoring system worked. Soviet pilots, ironically for a socialist country, received significant money bonuses for their victories, so to fight overclaiming and thus overspending, the confirmation rules were intentionally <em>very</em> strict, requiring, for example, the confirmation by the ground team, which automatically excluded any kills made behind the enemy lines, even if witnessed by other pilots. Pokryshkin also reportedly had many of his early kills not registered due to his bad relations with his superior officer.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59zir');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note59zir" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59zir');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bad enough that at one point his commander stripped him of his Communist Party membership card, effectively grounding him permanently, until his squadron-mates, with the help of their Political Officer, appealed to have the decision overturned.</span> Pokryshkin also had the habit of "giving out" his victories to his wingmen and other younger pilots in his regiment in later years of WWII, as attested in their memoirs. It's thought that his real kill count is somewhere in the vicinity of ~120 victories.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giora_Epstein">Giora Epstein<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. With a meager (compared to WWII aces) 17 confirmed kills holds the record for shot down jet planes and is the top ranking post-WWII ace. There is an old story about Giora being a part of the group escorting a certain United States senator / former fighter pilot around Israel. After a tour of the IAF museum the senator spent some time describing every single one of his 5 confirmed kills in detail before asking Giora himself whether he had anything to boast.
</li><li> John Thach is more a thinking ace pilot as a tactician, with only 8 air-combat kills, but who in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> invented The "Thach Weave" which allowed US pilots to fight the technically superior Japanese Zeroes, even frustrating Saburo Sakai, and later the Big Blue Blanket that was an effective defense against the feared Kamikaze suicide attacks.
</li><li> Frank G. Tallman, the legendary Hollywood stunt pilot. He may have never flown in combat but no one can deny that he was one of the greatest ace pilots who ever lived. Amongst other things he <em>flew a Beechcraft 18 through a steel framed billboard</em> at 200 MPH with less than 24 inches of clearance for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAMadMadMadMadWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAMadMadMadMadWorld">It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a></em> and landed a Standard J1 biplane on two-inch caster wheels for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWaldoPepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatWaldoPepper">The Great Waldo Pepper</a></em>. Tallman did things with real airplanes that no one would dare do outside of CGI nowadays and his book <em>Flying The Old Planes</em> is considered a classic of aviation literature. Ironically, he died in a preventable accident, flying at low altitude in bad weather.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobinOlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobinOlds">Robin Olds</a> wins the award for professional longevity first gaining 12 victories in World War 2 flying P-38s and P-51's in the European Theatre and then 20 years later he downed an additional 4 MiG's over Vietnam flying the F-4 Phantom. He retired in 1972 as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassGeneral">Badass General</a> and during his Vietnam years he was known for an extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache">handlebar mustache</a>. Indeed, to this day, American airmen honor General Olds' epic badassery by growing mustaches during Mustache March. Also, he has a <em>fighter wing</em> named in his honor: The 8th Fighter Wing, aka "The Wolfpack", from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> he gave before the battle<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6r4ga');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6r4ga" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6r4ga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact his calling them his "Wolfpack" was a callback to another unit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that one of his commanding officers used to fly for</span> where the wing, under his command, ambushed a dozen of the NVAF's newest MiG-21s and shot down seven of them... nearly half of North Vietnam's entire inventory of the advanced fighters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">With no American casualties.</a> <br/><br/>Olds is on the record that once he scored his 4th kill in Vietnam, he deliberately avoided taking a 5th MiG because he was informed they'd drag him out of combat and put him on publicity tours once he became a two-war ace.

So if things had gone a little differently, it's very possible that Olds could have become the only <em>three</em>-war ace.
</li><li> Though not an aerial ace, scoring no recorded kills on aircraft, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Carpenter_(lieutenant_colonel)">Major Charles Carpenter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is still regarded as both a highly skilled pilot of the ultralight L-4 Grasshopper scout plane and a complete lunatic known as "The Mad Major." The reason for this was due to his frustration at not being able to fight the Germans directly... whereupon he had bazooka tubes mounted to his normally unarmed scout plane and began hunting German armored vehicles. <em>And succeeding</em>. Major Carpenter is officially credited with at least six armored car and Panzer kills, though unofficially his unit believed he'd knocked out several times that amount, included at least one operational kill against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> Tiger tank. Bazookas had an effective range of about 250 yards and Carpenter had no means by which to aim them, meaning that he had to get dangerously close to take a shot, eyeball most of his shots without even the courtesy of iron sights, then pull up and away before he embedded himself in the ground at high speed, making him one of the most unconventional and terrifying tankbusters known to man. And he did this all in 1944 in Europe, meaning he didn't even have a year to make a name for himself committing this mayhem. He lived to survive the war and return to being a history teacher.

Director Lewis Gilbert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">got terrified</a> when the helicopter pilot said "Me kamikaze pilot!". But the man's flying was good enough for him to be hired by the film's production. And when two helicopters had a small on-air collision (which severed the foot of a cameraman), the kamikaze managed to land the damaged chopper on a really irregular terrain! (the film also features a lesser example in K.H. Wallis, the inventor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Little Nellie</a> who did some truly risky landing-takeoffs piloting it)
</li><li> Richard Candelaria, an American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> pilot who happened to fly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">P-51D Mustang</a> on April 7, 1945. He gets separated from his squadron and forms up on the bombers they were to be escorting ahead of the rest of his squadron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">just in time</a> to fight off 15 Luftwaffe in Bf 109 fighters, <em>including one German ace</em>, and two <em>more</em> in Me 262 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">jet fighters</a></em> <strong>alone</strong>. This man defeated the jets, possibly shooting down one, <em>shot down</em> the German ace in a one-on-one dogfight, and took out three other planes before the rest of his squadron arrived on scene, at which point the rest of the Germans bugged out. And you, too, can witness his feat thanks to modern science and an interview with the <em>man himself</em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy1qORp-vpc&amp;feature=related">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> His tale starts at 8:00 and continues into part 4 and 5.

</li><li> Louis E. Curdes was one of the few pilots (see below) to shoot down planes from <em>four</em> powers in World War II. In the Mediterranean, he shot down seven German planes and one Italian plane before being shot down and taken prisoner. He escaped and evaded capture for eight months before making it to Allied lines. He was later transferred to the Pacific where he shot down a Japanese plane (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">One of only three pilots to shoot down planes from all three Axis powers.</a>). THEN he shot down an American plane which was about to land in Japanese territory, forcing it to ditch. He is the only American pilot to earn a medal for shooting down an American plane. To top it off, his future wife was on that plane. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johntewell/5712609140/">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <br/><br/>Saburo Sakai and probably a few other Japanese pilots shot down planes from five different powers — Chinese, British, Dutch, Australian and American. This probably also goes for quite a few German pilots (some of whom had already shot down enemy aircraft in the Spanish Civil War), since Germany was engaged in war against several smaller powers in succession and simultaneously. For instance, in the North African theatre of operations the Luftwaffe faced not just the British, but also the Australian, South African, Free French and U.S. air forces. Meanwhile on the Eastern front, the Soviets were facing the air forces of Germany, Italy and various smaller powers allied to the Axis.
</li><li> Hans-Joachim "Jochen" Marseille aka the "Star of Africa", while not exactly the most famous German ace of World War II, was exactly what you'd expect an ace pilot to be - a total womanizer and party guy with not much respect for authority. He was transfered to the North African theater in order to get him away from French women. While in the Battle of Britain he had not been notably successful, in North Africa he became virtually unstoppable. He would charge his plane straight into large British formations, then use high deflection shots to shoot the cockpit of his foes (at such an angle, you can't even see the plane your shooting at due to the engine). He racked up 158 confirmed kills, which all were against Western Allies, all but seven in North Africa. On 1 September 1942 he shot down 10 fighters that can be verified on RAF records. Erich Hartmann said that he thought Marseille was the best shot of any fighter pilot. He was killed when he tried to bail out of his Bf 109G after the engine failed and he hit the vertical stabilizer.
</li><li> Second-highest on the list of top-scoring German "Experten" against Western Allies with 102 credited air victories was Adolf Galland, known to R.A.F. pilots as "the Fighting Fob". Like Marseille, he came from a French Huguenot family. He started flying in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War and finished the Second World War as commanding officer of the major German jet-fighter unit, the JV 44. Known for his love of cigars (there was a special holder in the cockpit) and for the Mickey Mouse emblem on his planes. <br/><br/>A note must be made here regarding the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JV_44">JV 44<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Many pilots recruited into the outfit had more than a hundred planes downed to their credit; the five top scoring pilots of the unit downed <em>more than a thousand planes combined</em> over their flying careers.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9n4wv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9n4wv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9n4wv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Barkhorn">Gerhard Barkhorn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (301), <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_B&lt;!--C3--&gt;A4r">Heinrich Bär<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (220), <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Krupinski">Walter Krupinski<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (197), <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Steinhoff">Johannes Steinhoff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (176), and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G&lt;!--C3--&gt;BCnther_L&lt;!--C3--&gt;BCtzow">Günther Lützow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (110), totaling into 1004 aircraft downed; Lützow's score includes five kills made in the Spanish Civil War.

Thankfully for the Allies, no more than six of the unit's planes were operational at any given time, and the war ended just two months after the unit's formation. Many of the pilots went on to become high-ranking officers in the postwar West German Air Force, aided by the fact that very few fighter pilots and even fewer aces of the Luftwaffe were ardent Nazis to begin with. Given the nature of modern aerial warfare, no such assembly of aces would likely ever exist again.
</li><li> Francis "Gabby" Gabreski scored 28 kills in World War II and another 6.5 in Korea, putting him half a kill short of being a septuple ace and making him one of the few two-war aces. He was famous (or infamous) for a flying style that was aggressive to the point of recklessness, often ripping into enemy formations before his wingmen had any chance to join the fight. His hyper-aggressive style made him controversial among his various wingmen; some thought he didn't care about fighting as a team and only wanted more kills for himself, while others loved the way he flew and tried to emulate his fast, hard-hitting tactics. This recklessness very nearly killed him on his final mission of World War II, a flight that wasn't even supposed to happen. He was scheduled to be flown home after having flown the standard maximum number of combat hours, but managed to convince somebody to let him fly "one more mission" escorting bombers into Germany. During a strafing run, he flew too low and clipped his propeller, and after he crashed he spent the rest of the war in a German POW camp. <br/><br/>Gabreski also happens to have been a Polish-American who spoke fluent Polish. Before the United States Army Air Forces were fully up to operational status in Europe, he managed to talk British authorities into letting him fly with the Free Polish Air Force (which was then under British operational control) so that he could gain combat experience before his unit entered operations.

Operating in harsh environments like the Australian Outback and the Canadian wilderness, a single pilot can be expected to do anything from shipping cargo, transporting people and acting as a flying ambulance.

</li><li> Almost 90 Czechoslovakian pilots flew in the Battle of Britain and served in several RAF units. Karel Kuttelwascher had 18 confirmed kills (plus 2 for fights in France). The top Czech scorer in the Battle of Britain was Sgt. Josef Frantiek, flying with Polish Fighter Squadron who claimed 17 confirmed kills, which made him the highest scoring Allied pilot in the Battle of Britain. Other Czechoslovakian flying aces were Alois Vaátko, Frantiek Peřina, Otto Smik, Josef Stehlík, Miloslav Mansfeld, Leopold rom, Václav Cukr, Otmar Kučera and Tomá Vybíral. The RAF's 303 Squadron was manned mostly by Polish pilots, plus Josef Frantisek, and despite arriving late they managed to be the top-scoring fighter outfit in the Battle of Britain, making them a squadron of Ace Pilots.
</li><li> Bob Hoover, regarded as one of the greatest pilots to have ever lived. Upon receiving the new P-38 Lightning, his first action he took in it was to shut off one of the engines at low altitude, and proceed to perform aerobatics, for which he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">barred from flying a P-38 ever again</a>. He was shot down over enemy lines in a Spitfire Mk V, then taken prisoner, only to later break out of prison, and fly a Fw-190 to the Netherlands.
</li><li> When flying in target-rich environment or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a>, almost any pilot who can survive long enough, will become an ace. The Battle of Malta produced more RAF aces than any other single campaign, top scorer being George "Screwball" Beurling with 27 kills.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10iskx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10iskx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10iskx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Beurling was a mix of bushwhacker and sniper; while his nearly superhuman eyesight and excellent understanding of trajectories allowed him down enemy fighters by shooting where they're <em>going</em> to be from long enough range that his gun camera wouldn't even catch the kill (since by the time the rounds hit his plane was pointed in a different direction), he preferred getting behind the enemy and downing them point-blank because he felt he could use fewer bullet per kill that way. To aid in the bushwhacking, he had all tracer rounds removed from his ammo so that enemies would have no visual cue that he was shooting at them.</span> Likewise, the top scoring RAF pilot, Marmaduke Thomas Pattle, scored the majority of his 50 kills during the Battle of Crete.
<ul><li> Pattle was the high scorer of both Gloster Gladiator (15) and Hawker Hurricane (35). Only 6 of his victories cannot be cross-checked on existing Italian or German records. He 25 of his victories in twenty days before his death in air combat over Eleusis Bay.
</li></ul></li><li> John Boyd, father of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane">F-15 and F-16</a> and the Energy-Maneuverability Theory, and the man who literally wrote the book on flying fighters, was himself a pretty hot pilot back in the 1950s. Though he never scored a kill (he was too young to enlist in World War II, he flew an F-86 in Korea but didn't serve a full tour of duty, and was assigned as a base commander in Vietnam), he made a name for himself as "Forty-Second Boyd," so named because of a challenge he issued to pilots in training. If a pilot could last forty seconds in a mock dogfight against him, he'd pay the pilot $40. No one ever pulled it off. And let's emphasize that he did this in an F-100, a capable plane but also so unforgiving that it was known for a 25% fatality rate <em>in training</em>.
</li><li> Edward "Butch" O'Hare, the namesake for O'Hare International Airport in Chicago (they even have an F4F Wildcat in front in his honor). He became the American navy's first ace of World War II by shooting down five enemy bombers in a single day (a feat which also earned him the Medal of Honor), and he was the one who proved that the F6F Hellcat marked the end of Japanese fighter superiority at Marcus Island, for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also helped the navy develop its night defense tactics, and according to a former wingman, always taught his pilots little tips and tricks to improve their flying. Unfortunately, though, he was lost in the navy's first night defense flight — he was caught in the crossfire between a Japanese G4M <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingNames">"Betty"</a> and a TBF Avenger, and his Hellcat dipped out of formation and into the darkness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Neither he nor his fighter were ever found</a>.
</li><li> Any reasonably competent pilot with a dash of aggressiveness and enough tactical savvy can score aerial victories in a plane designed for dogfighting. A very talented few (Rudel, Vejtasa) can score victories in a dive bomber. Adrian "Warby" Warburton of the RAF scored five aerial victories while flying a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Maryland">Martin Maryland<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">MEDIUM BOMBER</a> with forward-firing machine guns.

Short, tough, pugnacious, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">possessing of no brain-mouth filter</a>, and ugly. He first saw combat with the famed Flying Tigers in China, where he quickly butted heads with Claire Chennault on tactics. Boyington had a great advantage over many other pilots in his sheer physical strength, allowing himself to haul his plane through blackout-inducing maneuvers by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">raw force of will</a></em> that would leave his wingmen and opponents passing out. He was also known to pick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">the most battered, beat-up, and decrepit-looking</a> aircraft on the flight line<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note121er6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note121er6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note121er6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">unlike the Army Air Forces, the Navy and Marines didn't assign aircraft to individual pilots. Instead, pilots would fly whichever plane happened to be available. In fact many Marine squadrons in the South Pacific shared from a pool of aircraft operated by <em>all</em> squadrons at that base.</span> to instill confidence in the pilots under his command. During his time in China he was credited with two aerial victories and 1.5 aircraft destroyed on the ground (Boyington claimed six air victories). After the US entered the war, Boyington returned to the United States Marine Corps. Arriving in the Pacific, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">cobbled together a squadron from unassigned pilots under the designation VMF-214</a>. Originally dubbed "Boyington's Bastards," they were eventually immortalized as the legendary (and more media-friendly) Black Sheep.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note130ae2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note130ae2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note130ae2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Contrary to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSheepSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSheepSquadron">Black Sheep Squadron</a></em> series, the name does not come from them being a gang of screw-ups with one foot in the brig. <em>Boyington</em> certainly qualified, but the name simply comes from how they were organized from pilots sitting around with no other assignments.</span> Flying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">F4U Corsairs</a> in combat against the Japanese, Boyington claimed a total of 28 aerial victories (he's officially credited with 26) by the time he was shot down and captured in 1944, tying Rickenbaker as America's Ace of Aces (eventually surprassed). Throughout his active service, Boyington was in a heated competition with fellow Marine pilot Joe Foss (himself a legend to the Corps for his actions during the grueling Battle of Guadalcanal as part of the Cactus Air Force) to break Rickenbaker's record. The press, looking for a morale boost for Americans growing weary of the slogging war of attrition in the Pacific, ate Boyington's antics up, with such publicity stunts as sending the Black Sheep a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap for every Japanese plane shot down. This lead to an iconic <a class="urllink" href="https://acesofww2.com/USA/aces/boyington/VMF-214_1dec43.jpg">publicity photo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of the squadron standing on the wings of a Corsair with caps and bats. Both Boyington and Foss ultimately ended with 26 credited victories, however Foss is awarded the title of the Marine Corp's Ace of Aces since two of Boyington's victories came with the Flying Tigers. Boyington is almost as famous for his personality and being perhaps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for the two-fisted, hard-chariging, brash and belligerent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marine</a> as he was for his piloting.

Civilian examples are pilots who, through training, skill, and capability, have saved multiple lives either on their planes or on the ground, or both. As mentioned above, <em>technically</em> they don't fit the military definition of an ace because they saved lives rather than took them, but that takes nothing away from their skill - in fact, that some of these pilots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills">accomplished maneuvers that their craft should not be capable of</a>, under conditions like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">complete</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">engine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">failure</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">complete hydraulic system failure and power failure</a> makes them even more the trope.

Surviving multiple life support system failures in space, jury-rigging a system to keep themselves alive, and managing a successful return landing with all aboard surviving.
</li><li> The crew of Gemini VIII, Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott, survived a thruster malfunction (that nearly caused both to black out) and emergency abort, landing safely after only 10 hours in space. It was Armstrong's coolness-under-fire that got him picked to lead Apollo 11 on the first moon landing.
</li><li> Eric Moody and Roger Greaves of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_9">British Airways Flight 9.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: A cloud of volcanic ash had stalled all of the engines, flaming out one. Both kept the plane in the air anyway and it eventually landed safely, with no loss of life. Bonus points go to Moody for managing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">remain calm under pressure</a>:
<div class="indent">Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress.

Pearson operated the jet as if it was a glider to make the emergency landing at a disused airport, saving the lives of all onboard, none of whom were even seriously injured. Not to mention that <em>all</em> other pilots crashed the plane when they were put in simulation of the event.
</li><li> Subverted tragically with the Tenerife disaster. Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten, pilot of the KLM 747 involved in the crash, was the airline's most experienced and decorated pilot, and was regarded with such esteem that he served as KLM's spokesman and appeared in all of KLM's print adverts. It was this preceding reputation  as well as the fact that he was the pilot who had certified his first officer on the Tenerife flight  that probably factored into the crew's reluctance to stop him from impatiently taking off from the crowded, foggy airport without ATC clearance. This resulted in the destruction of two jumbo jets, the loss of 500+ lives, and the worst aviation disaster in history. In fact, when KLM found out that one of their jets was involved in the crash, they tried to contact Van Zanten to have him clean up the PR mess, not realizing that <em>he was the pilot involved in the crash</em>.
</li><li> Although they were unable to save the plane, the crew of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123">Japan Airlines Flight 123<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> certainly deserve mention. Because without any prior training, and under the effects of hypoxia, and with no hydraulic controls, they managed to keep their stricken 747 in the air for over thirty minutes before the plane slammed into a mountain, killing all but four of the 524 on board.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14ua2t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14ua2t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14ua2t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were more who survived the initial crash, who would have pulled through had rescue crews been able to get to the mountain sooner</span> What makes it more remarkable, is that in simulations after the accident, not a single simulator pilot was able to replicate the exact results and control the aircraft for anywhere near as long, while having the benefit of knowing beforehand what they were simulating, and having a clear head to do it.
<ul><li> The legacy of the accident would live on however when the crew of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232">United Airlines Flight 232<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> found themselves in a very similar situation. By pure chance, however, a United Airlines instructor and check pilot<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15ppkd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15ppkd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15ppkd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a guy who flies along side newly certified pilots or pilots up for re-certification to make sure they're doing their job correctly</span> was headed home to Chicago and happened to have chosen that particular flight to get him there. The instructor, Dennis Fitch, had actually studied the JAL 123 disaster carefully, and up until then had been trying to figure out how to make the DC-10 controllable with just engine power alone. His persistence almost paid off entirely when the aircraft suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure of the fan blade in its tail engine, and lost its hydraulic system, rendering the flight controls useless. By alternating throttle inputs, Fitch was able to assist pilot Alfred C. Haynes, first officer William Records, and second officer Dudley Dvorak with regaining some control over the plane's speed, altitude, and steering. The pilots were able to get the plane away from populated areas, notify emergency services, and try their best to land - and while 111 people did die in the resulting crash, 185 survived what could only be described as impossible odds due to these pilots - and without any ground casualties. Ironically, the crash also restored faith in the DC-10, which up until then, had been seen as a flying death trap following two major accidents, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191">second of which<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> grounded the fleet for months.

Their Boeing 747 lost its flight controls after Islamic terrorist Ramzi Yousef set off a bomb in the passenger cabin (as part of a trial run for a larger plot to bomb several international flights). Reyes and Herrera used the same steer-by-throttle method as Haynes and Fitch. The pilots eventually brought the aircraft down safely in Okinawa. Several passengers were injured by the blast, but the only fatality was a man who had the bad luck to be seated directly above the bomb.

Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger, who successfully glided the plane to a floating stop while avoiding river traffic, is the most well-known, but the entire crew of Flight 1549 was later awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. The airplane was then put on permanent display in the Carolinas Aviation Museum at Charlotte International Airport, where it is the centerpiece exhibit.
</li><li> 21 years before the Miracle on the Hudson <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACA_Flight_110">TACA Flight 110<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was on final approach to New Orleans airport when the plane's engines flamed out due to excessive water ingestion. Unable to restart them and with insufficient height to make it to an airport, the pilot, Carlos Dardano, prepared to ditch in one of the canals surrounding New Orleans. Then, at the last minute, the flight crew noticed a grass levee running alongside the canal, made the split-second decision to land there, managed to reposition the plane to align it with the levee, and pulled off a near-textbook landing. Not only was no one seriously injured, but the plane itself was in good enough condition that with only a single engine replacement<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16tbdq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16tbdq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16tbdq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the damaged engine being the <em>cause</em> of the crash, rather than the result of it</span>, the NTSB was able to fly it off the levee and to a nearby airport for further inspection and repairs. The aircraft was later returned to service.
</li><li> The unnamed pilot of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/09/06/this-delta-flight-flew-into-and-out-of-san-juan-defying-irma/?tid=sm_fb&amp;utm_term=.70d8a35b6668">Delta Flight DL431/DL302 out of San Juan, Puerto Rico to New York City, On September 5, 2017<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It landed in San Juan at 11:58 am and took off less than an hour later at 12:43 pm. This sounds routine, but at the time, Hurricane Irma was lashing the Island. The plane was flying in the relatively narrow gap of calm air between the outer band and the core of the second most powerful hurricane in the history of the Atlantic Basin. It maintained itself in the narrow band of calm air for over 400 miles.
<ul><li> This was actually entirely planned by everyone at Delta from the pilot, the ground crew, and dispatch office and corporate headquarters, all needed for the fast turn around. And proven when Delta did it again before Hurricane Maria just a week later.
