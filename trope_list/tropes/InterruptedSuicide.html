Aramaki orders his dogs to drag him out of the water, which they do. It isn't until Arashi finds substantial proof that Hana is in the post-apocalyptic world that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyFailedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyFailedSuicide">happy about not having died</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePromisedNeverland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePromisedNeverland">The Promised Neverland</a></em>: Yugo had fully prepared to shoot himself after spending years alone and was convinced all his friends he escaped with were dead, until he heard Emma and her group arriving at the underground shelter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kafuka tries to stop Nozumu every time but does something to <em>make it worse</em> (e.g. <em>trying to pull him down</em> as he hangs himself, or accidentally pushing him over as he tries to jump in front of a train). Nozomu quickly recovers and screams "What if I died!?"
</li><li> At the end of episode 11, Nozomu takes out a noose to attempt to hang himself, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is hit by a runaway trolley before he can do so</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">This is never mentioned again.</a>
</li><li> Also in the third episode, Nozomu saves Kaede from jumping off the roof just in the nick of time. Not because he's particularly worried for her safety, but because he's already pinned the roof for <em>his</em> suicide spot and doesn't want anyone stealing his thunder.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: Episode 46 features an example where a villain accidentally interrupts a suicide. A woman was about to jump off a cliff when she overhead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Baron Ashura</a> telling that they had planted nukes on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase">Institute</a> (where she had left her baby shortly after). She got so worried about her son that she forgot about her suicide to try and warn the heroes about the bombs.

</li><li> In 2003 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, after killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Winry's parents</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colonel Mustang</span>, in shock, put his gun under his chin. Tim Marcoh talked him down from it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Gaara attempted to slash his own wrists as a young child but was blocked by his own sand barrier. This is after a classic example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> since while he had never actually been injured due to said sand barrier and was only half-halfheartedly trying out of curiosity, the fact that a child would casually try something like that is still rather indicative of Gaara's state of mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>, naturally, does this in an extreme way, with Simon and Kinon becoming the first humans to jump through hyperspace to arrive in the nick of time to stop <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rossiu</span> from committing suicide (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">a flying punch to the face</a>).
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em> the anime <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shuichi arrives just in time to keep Yuki from committing suicide. Keeping up with the spirit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> of the series, Shuichi is wearing a dog suit as he bursts through the wall just as Yuki is about to shoot himself</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em> has a flashback in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an orphaned Kaoru tries to off himself, but is stopped by Kurei</span>, which explains why he's a member of the Uruha.
</li><li> Uigher has been stopped from suicide in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu">Haré+Guu</a></em>. It is played for laughs, partly due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> nature.
</li><li> Nanette in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma">Victorian Romance Emma</a></em>: after being discovered to have stolen a fan from the mistress of the house and being fired as a result, she dashes out to drink something lethal and is stopped by Emma. Later in the same season, there is a slight subversion, Emma is contemplating the sea and walking toward it leading Hans to assume that she is about to kill herself which was not the case.
</li><li> Subverted in Hasoda's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGirlWhoLeaptThroughTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGirlWhoLeaptThroughTime">The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</a></em>, where the main character tries to jump out of her bedroom window but is stopped by her concerned little sister. The thing is, she wasn't trying to kill herself; she was trying to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">time-leap, and hadn't quite figured out how to do it properly.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played for some combination of laughs and drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">twice</a></em>: first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Misaki</span> tries jumping off a cliff <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where her mom killed herself years ago</span> but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satou</span> catches her in a rather humiliating way. Then, he jumps off the same cliff himself, realizing how pathetic his life is, only to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fall onto a protective grid below that was installed <em>because</em> Misaki's mom died there</span>. Can it get any more humiliating than that?
</li><li> An earlier episode also has Satou get caught up in an online suicide pact with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his upperclassman, Hitomi. Her boyfriend,</span> Misaki and Yamazaki all rush into the meeting place to save him.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Misa Amane</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> tries to bite her tongue off because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rem</span> won't kill her, but Watari gags her just before she can do it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She eventually kills herself - in the anime, via throwing herself off a building at the end of the series.</span>

This was due to some bad advice that he broke his arm over, and he in suit thought that his career as a baseball player was over. So he moseyed on over to the edge of the school rooftop and prepared to jump, and he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">dead serious about it</a>. With an audience of students trying to cajole him out of it, the only voice he listened to was Tsuna's. He ended up falling due to bad construction of a gate. Don't worry, Tsuna Saved Him.

</li><li> There was another time when Dieter found out that the local children had been talked by Johan into playing a certain game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The "game" involves two children walking toward each other along the edge of a roof until one of them falls. The boy challenging Dieter had already lost at least once, but keeps playing after surviving the fall.</span>
</li><li> A young orphan boy, Milos, tries to jump off a bridge after failing to find his mother in the red-light district and concluding that he's unwanted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's rescued in the nick of time by Grimmer and Tenma.</span>

<ul><li> Twin sisters Kasumi and Shizuku contracted the deadly disease Medusa. Kasumi was selected by lottery to be turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicle</a> until a cure was found; Shizuku was not. Kasumi attempted to kill herself so that Shizuku could take her place, but Shizuku interrupted her and demanded that she lives on.
</li><li> Later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kasumi tries to throw herself off a high ledge when she sees what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Shizuku has become due to Medusa</a>, thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">she'll be with Marco</a> and her suicide will help Shizuku.

<ul><li> This happens on more than a few occasions with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Suzaku</a>.

Annie Cartwright, the WPC with a degree in psychology, tries to talk him down and her words do reach him, but what ultimately convinces him to quit is noticing some grains of sand on Annie's hand (from when she was climbing up to save him).

<ul><li> A somewhat chilling subversion. A man who attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge but survived was talking about the things that drove him to commit the act. Towards the end of the interview, he mentions that of all the spectators at the bridge, none of them intervened. He then admits that just before he jumped off, he wished one of them would intervene.
<ul><li> His interview was featured in the documentary <em>The Bridge</em> which includes multiple variations on this situation. One man talks about taking pictures of the bridge and needing a few minutes to realize that he's taking pictures of a woman who has stepped over the ledge and is about to jump.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/8-tiny-things-that-stopped-suicides/">8 Tiny Things That Stopped Suicides<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Of those eight, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/14/world/main6580981.shtml">this guy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> deserves special mention. He lives in Australia's hottest suicide spot, and he has an intimate experience with people who want to end it all. And what does he do when they try to jump? He offers them a cup of tea and a smile.
</li><li> In a real-life example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Comedic Sociopathy</a>, a suicidal Chinese man was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.weirdasianews.com/2009/05/23/suicidal-man-pushed-bridge-onlooker/">pushed off a bridge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by a spectator who was enraged that he was blocking traffic. (It's nothing like as bad as it looks; the man had been standing on the bridge for several hours, long enough for the police to get an inflatable cushion under him. He survived with minor injuries.)
</li><li> On-line chats, such as IRC, have interrupted and prevented many suicides. Suicidality is far more a surge of helplessness and unovercomeable agony rather than a carefully pre-planned determined project, and even a slight token of support, such as discussion and lending an ear to listen may be enough for the worst agony to pass over and the suicide candidate to survive and get over with the worst. <em>Even you</em> can prevent a suicide. If someone on-line sound suicidal and is serious, <em>please</em> talk with him or her.
</li><li> The "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.rethink.org/aboutus/what-we-do/making-change-happen/find-mike/">Find Mike<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" campaign. In 2008 schizophrenia sufferer Jonny Benjamin was about to jump off a bridge to his death when a random passerby engaged him in conversation and kept him from jumping until professional help arrived. Six years later Benjamin launched the campaign to find and thank the man (real name Neil Laybourn), this led to a reunion and both men becoming active participants in the "Rethink Mental Illness" charitable campaign.
