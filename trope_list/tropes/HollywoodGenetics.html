Having one copy of a dominant allele means that the person will express the dominant trait, and the only way for someone to express a recessive trait requires having two copies of a recessive allele. Even outside of scientific terms, it's common reasoning that certain traits tend to run in families and we expect relatives to "match" in some way.
</p><p>These facts are sometimes ignored in Hollywood casting, which can end up having (biological) families looking like just a random group of people. As a result, you'll see blondes having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor">black-haired</a> children, biracial people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMixedRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMixedRace">who look more black/Asian/etc.</a> than their black/Asian/etc. parent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort">inexplicably large discrepancies in height between parents and children</a>, and so on.

"Where did Alice get black hair and brown eyes if Bob and Carol are green-eyed redheads?"
</p><p>This can even interfere with the plot if a physical resemblance is a plot point (especially in an adaptation when characters get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">Adaptation Dye-Job</a> or otherwise don't match the physical description of the character in the original work).
</p><p>There are certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifications</a>; the mechanics behind real life genetic inheritance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityisUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityisUnrealistic">are more complicated</a> than the Mendelian model, which doesn't factor in mutations, malfunctions, and polygenetic traits. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance">casting around to get the most plausible genetics is not always practical</a>—after all, you're not going to turn down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> for a part because his eyes are the wrong color. Sometimes it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, as having a cast of characters who all look the same is rather boring.

</li><li> Invoked for the merfolk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: due to their unusual biology, merfolk carry the genes of all their immediate ancestors, so family members are not even guaranteed to be of the same <em>species</em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/9/99/Ryugu_Kingdom_Princes.png">These three<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> are full-brothers.

</li><li> Chibi-Usa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> generated a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> back in the day because her coloration (pink hair, red eyes) was so different from that of her parents (blonde, blue-eyed Usagi and black haired, dark blue-eyed Mamoru). According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, her coloration was meant to make her resemble a baby rabbit to match her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Name</a>. Also, hair colors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">the manga</a> weren't static—sometimes her mother Usagi was depicted with silver hair and even pink hair in her original design. Usagi herself is the daughter of a purple-haired mother and a black-haired, dark-eyed father, and has a brother with light brown hair and dark blue eyes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series is a strong aversion, even regarding facial features. In fact, the only character whose look isn't readily accounted for in their family is Tenchi's mother Kiyone (silver hair and gray eyes while her parents have black hair/brown eyes and green hair/yellow eyes), and since she and her parents are two different kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>, we have no idea how their genetics exactly work anyway.
</li><li> Actually <em>invoked</em> in the main continuity with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aeka. She was born with curly aqua-green hair like her mother and sister, but later underwent gene manipulation to activate her father's genes for straight purple hair. She wanted her hair to be darker to look more like her black-haired <em>step</em>mother Funaho so she could win the affections of her half-brother/fiancé, Yosho.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Takeshi and his sister from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em> have blond hair however their parents have dark hair. Similarly, Kaori's parents are brunettes but she has blonde hair. It's even more noticeable because they're the only characters in the series without black or brown hair.
</li><li> Rin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> is a blonde but both her mother and father are black haired (though her father's hair was grey due to age). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The manga revealed late into the series that Daikichi's grandfather isn't Rin's biological father. It's possible she got her hair color from her real father.</span>
</li><li> Nagisa Hazuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em> is a blond but has brunette older sisters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cilan, Chili, and Cress are triplets who have green, red, and blue hair, respectively. Their eye colors match their hair colors.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">Pocket Monsters: The Animation</a></em>, Brock and his siblings are the result of his mother's multiple marriages, yet they all look exactly like Brock's father Flint. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">ignores</a> the novel (for what it's worth, the book was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiShudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiShudo">Takeshi Shudō</a>, the anime's original head writer, and is fairly revisionist in its depiction of events).
</li><li> Misty and her three older sisters have different hair colors: red (orange toned rather than bright red), pink, blue, and blonde. The aforementioned books justify this by saying Misty's sisters wear wigs; however, the anime itself holds no such implications.
</li></ul></li><li> In the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>, Rena's parents have brown hair while she is a redhead. Averted in the manga adaptation, however, where Rena inherited her mom's hair colour.

</li><li> Magical abilities actually seem to act dominantly at times (when two magical people produce a Squib, for example), while acting recessively at other times (when two non-magical people produce a magical person because a distant ancestor had magical abilities). And that isn't even getting into the other abilities that can be passed down (Parseltongue, Metamorphagus, Harry's always crazy black hair).

It's plausible to put the Baratheon children's paternity in doubt, since having three children in a row with the same recessive trait only expressed by one parent is unlikely, but having a trait stick so tenaciously to one family after centuries of mixed breeding is extremely unlikely.

One might wonder how that was possible when it's strongly implied that townfolks and people in the Seam haven't interbred for generations. It's possible that their father carried those genes too but it's highly unlikely. This has even spawned a fan-theory that Prim is Katniss' half-sister and that she might even be half-sister to blonde, blue-eyed Peeta (whose father had a romance with Katniss' mother when they were young).

<ul><li> This was an early concern during casting: Michael J. Fox almost didn't get the role of Alex P. Keaton because the producers at NBC didn't think it was realistic that the 5'4" Fox could be the son of 6'4" Michael Gross and 5'7" Meredith Baxter.
</li><li> While it's not really viewed this way by viewers, Meredith Baxter said in an interview that she was surprised to see someone as beautiful, dark and kind of exotic as Justine Bateman being cast with such a white-bread looking family.
</li></ul></li><li> Seemingly averted, but actually played straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. A patient in an early episode found out that he was adopted because, as he claims, parents without cleft chins can't have a child with one, and the doctors agree with this claim. In fact, such a parent-child scenario <em>is</em> possible— <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">just unlikely</a>. Based solely on that trait, the patient shouldn't have been able to tell either way if he was adopted, and Foreman (correctly) explains that while it's unlikely for him to be his parent's child, it's not impossible.
</li><li> A plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, despite being set in a world with no knowledge of genetics. All three "Baratheon" children all have blonde hair and green eyes like their mother, Cersei, despite the fact that their father, Robert Baratheon, has very dark brown (described as black) hair and eyes. While this in itself is possible, Ned reads through a book detailing Baratheon lineage and discovers that every dark-haired Baratheon male has always sired dark-haired children even if their mother was blonde. This would make it a lot less likely that Robert would be carrying recessive genes for blonde hair. Even without knowledge of genetics, this arouses suspicion, and is what leads Ned to the conclusion that Cersei's children are actually bastards born out of incest with her dirty blond-haired brother Jamie.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNeighbors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNeighbors">The Neighbors</a></em>. The Bird-Kersee family consists of father - Larry (British, blond, and Caucasian), mother - Jackie (African-American), older son Reggie (Asian American), and younger son - Dick (Caucasian, american, and red-haired). They are all genetically related, though they are aliens from the planet Zabvron, and could choose their own human appearances. Funny though, because the parents and children don't see why they aren't seen as genetically related by strangers.
</li><li> An example where family members are much too <strong>similar</strong> than is genetically plausible in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack">Orphan Black</a></em>: In the third episode, Cosima tells Sarah that clones' fingerprints may be close enough to all match, when in reality not even identical twins have the same fingerprints. Even accepting this premise leaves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a>, unfortunately. Beth's finger prints would have been put into the system when she became a police officer. If Sarah's arrest happened first, Beth would have had quite some difficulty getting into the police at all. If it happened second, the whole mess should have exploded then. Since only Sarah's fingerprints came up when Katja's were run, it must be that Beth's aren't in the system - presumably the showmakers don't know that police employees' fingerprints always go into the system. As for the "identical twins" part of things, averted entirely with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helena</span>, who wore gloves when on the run to avoid getting fingerprinted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a></em>, Udonna, who looks Irish, has a son with Leanbow, who looks Spanish. The kid, Bowen, looks Arabian, with skin about eight shades darker than either of theirs— a shade fairly close to that of his parents' close friend Daggeron. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby">No comment is made on this matter.</a>

<ul><li> The redheaded title character and her blond ex-husband Brock have blonde Cheyenne, redheaded Kyra, and...black-haired Jake? In one episode it's stated that Brock dyes his hair, but it's not made clear if blond was his original color or not. Either way, it still wouldn't explain the vastly different hair colors that their kids have unless either Cheyenne or Jake dyes their hair too (Cheyenne was shown as a blond in a flashback to her first day of school and is unlikely to have dyed her hair at that age. This is the same reason why Jake probably doesn't dye his either.)
</li><li> Adding to the confusion, Brock's other son Henry, whose mother is the very blond Barbra Jean, also has dark hair.

Picard, on the other hand, has brown eyes... However, while eye color is controlled by at least three genes and blue eyes mean you have to be recessive for all three, the color alleles are not completely dominant. It is possible for blue-eyed parents to have brown-eyed children.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, Archer decides to withhold a cure for a disease that's killing an entire race because it's their destiny as decided by their genes and they have to go to make room for another species.

This is true even when they're pretending to be FBI agents or have some other plausible explanation for working so closely together.
</li><li> Several on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>:
<ul><li> Stefan and Damon sort of (if you squint) resemble their father, but the two brothers don't resemble each other at all.
</li><li> Elena looks very different from her brother and aunt, but then it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was adopted.</span> Though it's later played straight when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her birth parents were her father's brother John Gilbert and Isobel Flemming. While you could say she shares some of their facial features, there's no way two pale-skinned light-eyed people could have produced an olive-skinned child with dark brown eyes.</span>
</li><li> Elijah bears no resemblance to his family either, having much darker features overall. Ironic since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Klaus</span>, who does match the rest of the family, is supposed to be the illegitimate child.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lampshaded in a sadistic Halloween prank in an episode, where the dark-haired Roseanne and Dan had the dark-haired Darlene and D.J., but a blonde Becky (which isn't as unbelievable as some versions of this). When their snobby neighbor Kathy Bowman came over, she found Dan lying on the kitchen table, "gutted open" with assorted pieces of raw meat and fake blood sitting on his stomach. Roseanne walks in, covered in blood and holding a dripping knife, and she casually complains that she was so much better at this the last time. When Kathy asks what "last time," Roseanne casually says, "Becky's dad, he was blond, too."
</li><li> Averted strongly with the casting of D.J. While neither Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Lecy Goranson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">or Sarah Chalke</a> (Becky) bore a notable resemblance to their TV family, the main reason Roseanne Barr pushed for Michael Fishman to be cast was because he looked like he could be in her family, and even as an adult he looks like he could be one of her real children. He even played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosscastRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosscastRole">a younger Roseanne</a> in flashbacks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie">Good Luck Charlie</a></em>: Parents Bob and Amy are blonde and blue-eyed, but their only blonde, blue-eyed kid is PJ. Gabe and Toby are dark-haired with brown eyes. While Teddy and Charlie are blonde, Teddy has brown eyes and Charlie's eyes are either brown or green.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie">Liv and Maddie</a></em>: Both parents are brown-eyed brunettes and their son (Joey) looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Robbie Shapiro</a> (and Parker, also a brunette, is the Rooneys' answer to Ruthie Camden), so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">its very plausible that the two daughters are platinum blondes</a>. Apparently the producers thought no one would notice. Blonde hair and green eyes are both recessive traits, so it is technically possible for the twins to have them though.
<ul><li> Played for laughs in how people are stunned to realize chubby redhead Artie and tall, handsome dark-haired Diggle are brothers. Artie not only assumes the resemblance is obvious but that he's more handsome than Diggle.
</li></ul></li><li> Actor Yaphet Kotto was cast as Lt. Al Giardello on the award-winning cop series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>, though his dark complexion and facial features made it very implausible for him to be the biracial son of an Italian-American father and an African-American mother. One episode of the series even went out of its way to draw attention to the issue when a light-skinned African-American woman declined to date Giardello because he was "too black" for her. That said, Kotto was outstanding in the role and it's impossible to imagine another actor playing Giardello. There is a valid argument for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorblindCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorblindCasting">colorblind casting</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3h11r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3h11r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3h11r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, genetics is a roulette game. It is actually <em>not</em> impossible that despite being biracial, Giardello simply took after his presumably dark-skinned mother and doesn't display a trace of his father.</span>
</li><li> Although many of the families on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> look related, a glaring example of this trope pops up in Season 4 with the Secretary of Defense and his daughter (played by William Devane and Kim Raver, respectively). To say they don't look alike is...an understatement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeUnexpected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeUnexpected">Life Unexpected</a>: Lux <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">lampshades</a> how unlikely two brunettes having a blonde-haired child is in the second episode, where it turns out to be why she got her name (meaning "Light" in Latin). Interestingly, actress Britt Robertson, who plays her, isn't a real blonde anyway-her dark roots clearly show-and they could have just made Lux a brunette with dyed hair too.
</li><li> Became a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>. When the cast was revealed, many cried foul at the fact that the dark-haired Willa Holland (Thea Queen) was supposed to be the daughter of two blonde parents (Thea's brother, Oliver, is played by the also-dark-haired Stephen Amell, but flashbacks have his hair much blonder and his present-day hair is cut so short it really doesn't matter.) However, a major plot development in the second season revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thea is actually the illegitimate daughter of black-haired Malcolm Merlyn</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>, most of the Matthews family look like they could be related, with the glaring exception of the main character Cory. He is played by the Jewish Ben Savage, who has dark curly hair, while the rest of the Matthews are played by WASPy-looking actors with wavy dark blonde hair. The contrast wasn't quite as obvious at the start of the series, but became quite a bit more noticeable after Ben/Cory went through puberty, where he became noticeably more Jewish-looking and even started affecting some stereotypical Jewish mannerisms. The hair inconsistency gets a reference at one point where it's mentioned that a babysitter once curled Cory's hair and it's been stuck that way ever since. The cast also joke about this at one point on the DVD commentary.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO">Hawaii Five-O</a></em> episode "A Bullet For El Diablo," the daughter of a dictator is kidnapped as part of a plot to assassinate him - they'll substitute her twin half-sister, who's a member of the gang. Yes, El Diablo impregnated two completely different women who gave birth to females who look <strong>exactly</strong> alike. No, this isn't a science fiction story. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And yes, the plan does work.</span>
</li><li> Played for laughs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits">Suits</a></em> with Louis, a short man with a weasel-like face when his sister drops by, played by the gorgeous Amy Acker. People are stunned to see her and trying in vain to figure out how she and Louis could possibly be related. Even funnier? Louis assumes the shock is because "we could be twins."

<ul><li> At least one episode ("Taterhead is Our Love Child") has pointed out how Jake looks nothing like Alan and, although unsaid, he really doesn't look like Judith either (for instance, both Alan and Judith have dark brown hair while Jake's hair is considerably lighter. Jake has blue eyes like Alan, but Judith's brown eyes should have been passed on to him). When Charlie and Alan drop Jake off at Judith's at the end of the episode, they see a plumber, a water boy, and a postman — all of whom look like Jake and are well-acquainted with Alan and Judith. Alan is oblivious.
</li><li> Charlie and Alan are both brunettes, but their mother Evelyn has red hair. Either Evelyn isn't a natural redhead (it wouldn't be out-of-character for her to dye her hair, considering how she's always boasting about getting cosmetic procedures) or they take after their unseen father.
</li><li> Charlie and Alan have the same hair color and that's it. Otherwise, they don't have any resemblance to each other (for one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a> has brown eyes and Jon Cryer has blue eyes, but it's difficult to tell this in a sitcom.) Much like the Winchesters, they are usually mistaken for a gay couple by those unfamiliar with them and even pretended to be one to impress a gay client of Charlie's.
</li><li> None of Berta's relatives look anything alike. Berta's a redhead, her daughter Naomi is blonde and her sister, other daughter and granddaughter are brunettes. Then again, considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">implications of Berta's family</a>, it could be justified, either due to hair dyeing or illegitimacy.

Their daughter, Allison, had dark brown eyes and either dark brown or black hair that was naturally a bit wavy when she had it long. There were fandom theories that Allison might actually be the biological daughter of her aunt, Kate, and a member of the Hale family. After she had her hair lightened, she did show a slightly stronger resemblance to her aunt than she did previously. Kate was blonde with somewhat wavy hair and green eyes, and all the Hales shown had either black or dark brown straight hair and a combination of blue, green, and brown eyes. Kate and Chris' father, Gerard, had blue eyes, but it's not clear what color his hair was before it turned white-gray and he started balding. A flashback did show a brown-haired Argent with brown eyes, however, and he might have been Gerard's brother, although all that's said is he was Chris' uncle. Given the fact the Hales were supernatural and Allison started having precognitive hallucinations, this only added to the theory that, at least, one of her parents might not be a biological one.

<ul><li> While it is played for laughs in the episode, there isn't ever any clear statement of how pony genetics work. Despite the variable number of limbs, they are all a single species. The existence of Cloudsdale indicates that you don't have surprise non-Pegasi births (as the city is made of clouds, any non-pegasus will fall through the floor), so it's likely a recessive gene.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kenny is blond, his parents have brown hair (his father) and red hair (his mother), and his older brother and younger sister also have brown hair. The reason could be some people have blond hair as children and light brown hair as adults, but as stated before, Karen already has brown hair.
</li><li> Craig has black hair, but his father is a redhead and his mother is a blonde. Though if the blowup-doll replica of his mother and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairyGirl">bush</a> is accurate, she's probably not a natural blonde.
</li><li> A lampshaded case, which currently provides the page image, happens in the episode "Ginger Kids". Stan and Kyle visit the home of three ginger kids and discover that the kids' parents are brunettes. The couple explains that they both had recessive genes for red hair and that's why their kids look the way they do<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5goau');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5goau" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5goau');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, as noted in the image caption above, it would still be extremely unlikely for two brunettes with recessive genes for red hair to produce three children in a row who are gingers.</span>, though they seem quite disappointed about that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dark Skinned Blonds</a> teenage superheroine Artemis is the biracial daughter of blond, Caucasian supervillain Sportsmaster and the Vietnamese-American reformed supervillainess Huntress. While not outright impossible (such as if there was a blond, Caucasian ancestor on her mother's side, which could happen since Vietnam is a former French colony) Artemis' hair colour is, at best, unlikely. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">actually based</a> on the daughter of one of the show's producers who is half-Korean on both sides (both parents are mixed race) and a natural blonde.
</li><li> Cheshire herself has a child by the timeskip in season two. Lian is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roy's</span> daughter and inherited his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">red</span> hair color. She mixes her original comic design (which took completely after her father) with her more well-known redesigned look (which looks more like her mother). As with Artemis, it's justified in that Cheshire is multiracial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being Artemis' sister</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: Homer (had brown hair before he went bald) and Marge (blue hair) have three blonde kids. None of the Bouviers are blonde, and Abe Simpson also had brown hair... One episode claims that Bart's natural hair color is <em>red</em> which makes it weirder.
</li><li> Major characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> have naturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">technicolor hair</a> but more minor characters don't. This extends even to parents, which causes this:
<ul><li> Kimber and Jerrica are two of the very few main characters who have both biological parents shown. Jerrica is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">near identical</a> to their blonde mother but Kimber, with her pinkish-red hair, doesn't resemble either her father or mother. Her father has reddish hair, but not in the same tone as Kimber.
</li><li> Raya's entire family has black hair except for her. She has <em>pink</em> hair and, according to a childhood flashback, it is likely natural.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dark-Skinned Blond</a> Riot has parents who are lighter skinned and have brown hair. According to "Riot's Hope", his skin and hair color are natural.
</li><li> Purple-haired Clash has a reddish haired father.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em>: Caillou's dad has brown hair, and his mom has black hair. His little sister...has red hair.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens">Big City Greens</a></em>: Tilly has black hair, despite her dad, brother, and grandmother having brown hair (though the grandmother's hair is grey now), and her mother being a redhead. However, an episode covering the Greens' family history shows some of the Green ancestors have a strong resemblance to Tilly.
<ul><li> Tilly's grandfather has black hair, suggesting he passed the gene down through Bill to Tilly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>
<ul><li> The brown-haired Hank and Peggy have a blond-haired son Bobby. Their parents also had brown hair in their youth but it's implied it comes from Hank's side of the family as Hank's half-brother that Cotton fathered from his second wife Didi looks identical to Bobby blond hair and all.
</li><li> Turns out that Hank has another half-brother named Junichiro, who was the result of Cotton's relationship with his Japanese nurse following WWII. Junichiro looks exactly like an Asian version of Hank, even though Hank gets his looks from his mother Tilly, who is of no relation to Junichiro.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em>, the redheaded Tulip has a blonde mother and a brunet father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian">Dave the Barbarian</a></em>: Dave has brown hair. His father and sisters are redheads and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> mother has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">pink hair</a> (Dave, Fang, and Candy all have tanned skin to reflect their mother's ancestry, however).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: Main character Marinette has blue eyes, while her parents have grey and hazel eyes.

His siblings, Brad and Brianna, have black and blonde hair
</li></ul>respectively. Harold could be hiding a gene for either of those shades, but not both and Honey would only have red hair genes.
