<ul><li> This trope is what starts the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>. A high-schooler is accused of murdering his entire class, when in fact he was deliberately left alive and framed as the only survivor.
</li><li> A twist occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lt. Maria Ross is accused of murdering Lt. Col. Hughes. She's not allowed to present the evidence that proves her innocence because it involves the testimony of her parents, whom she was visiting at the time of the murder, and family members aren't allowed to testify. Her partner, Sgt. Brosh, is also not allowed to speak on her behalf. She's confident that justice will still carry the day, though...until she's informed that it's been reported in the newspaper that she was convicted <em>while she's still awaiting trial</em>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, Jolyne Kujoh winds up in the Green Dolphin prison because of this. Her boyfriend commits a hit-and-run, which she agrees to keep quiet about; he then reports the car stolen and bribes Jolyne's lawyer to provide false information about the terms of her plea bargain (she thought she'd get less than five years after a grace period, and ended up with fifteen). She wasn't even aware that the victim was dead until her sentencing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out to be part of a larger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">frame-up</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to get at her father, although neither her boyfriend or the lawyer were directly involved with the ones behind it.</span>
</li><li> This happens a <em>lot</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>; In order to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">sympathetic pirate protagonists</a>, there have to be not just evil pirates, but also corrupt law officials or nobility in order to justify the heroes' law-breaking.
<ul><li> In the backstory for the Skypiea Arc, historical explorer Montblanc Noland reportedly found a city of gold on one of his voyages. His king was <em>very</em> eager to see it for himself, and insisted Noland lead a second expedition consisting of the king's personal army. By the time they got there, the city, and the piece of island it was on, was gone. Rather than accept the rational explanation that there might have been a disaster that destroyed the city, the king held a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> and had Noland imprisoned for fraud. The result was that Noland became the figure of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a> fable, and his descendants would be ridiculed through the ages. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The city was gold was actually blasted into Skypiea by a powerful geyser. Luffy proves its existence by ringing the city's ceremonial bell while defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.</span>
</li><li> In Franky's backstory, Franky's teacher Tom was framed for a terrorist attack by espionage agents so they could interrogate him over the blueprints for an ancient superweapon he possessed. Tom had the last laugh, however- he saw the treachery coming and passed the blueprints on to his students, and they eventually destroyed them.

</li><li> A lawyer gets one guilty client off by invoking the numerous superheroic instances of this trope — evil twins, doppelgangers, mind control — and cites the Silver Agent's death as probably the clinching factor.

</li><li> A unique example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondAReasonableDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondAReasonableDoubt">Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</a>.</em> A newspaper publisher decides to test the system by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">having himself framed</a> for the murder of a woman. He intends to wait for the trial to nearly find him guilty before having a friend bring up the evidence to exonerate him. However, the friend is killed on his way to the courthouse and the evidence lost so the man is found guilty. His girlfriend is able to prove his innocence, only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for his wife to discover that he did indeed murder the woman, who was his first wife, and his execution is set to go on</span>.
</li><li> The 2009 remake of <em>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</em> plays it mostly the same, as reporter C.J. frames himself to prove a D.A. is corrupt and willing to put innocent people behind bars to pad his record. Again, the evidence is lost and C.J. is put in jail, but his girlfriend Crystal proves his innocence and the case is a mistrial. But then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crystal realizes the murder victim was going to give away she was the "drug addict" from C.J.'s award-winning documentary, proving his career was a fraud. Crystal tells C.J. it was a good plan, as he couldn't be tried again...except it was a mistrial, not an acquittal, which means the police can arrest him all over again.</span>

He decided to rape and murder a random girl in a crazy plot to get himself arrested and later exonerated so when he got out and immediately murdered the prosecutor who pushed the first case, everyone involved would thus be guilty of letting a real criminal go free to commit more murders. He manages to utterly succeed at the first and second parts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>: Marv from "The Hard Goodbye" is put on death row and ultimately executed for murdering all the women Kevin and Cardinal Roark killed and ate. Though, to be fair, the list of victims also included all the people that Marv <em>did</em> kill, including the two villains in question. John Hartigan from "That Yellow Bastard" is wrongly imprisoned for eight years on false charges of raping Nancy Callahan, the 11-year-old girl who he saved from pedophile rapist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Junior Roark, whose father is a powerful and corrupt U.S. Senator. Both cases were due to extreme corruption, forged evidence, and confessions acquired by threats — Marv confessed after his mother's life was threatened, and Hartigan when he thought that Nancy's life was in danger, and he was able to get out on parole if he did. (Even if he'd had ironclad proof of his innocence, he could still have readily been charged with excessive force for shooting Junior in the genitals <em>after</em> disarming him.)

<ul><li> Happens just about <em>all the damned time</em> in daytime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a>, where the continuous narrative structure lends itself to this sort of shenanigans. If an innocent is framed for a major crime (usually murder), you can bet your bottom dollar they will be found guilty, sent to jail and have a thoroughly rotten time for a few weeks before being found not guilty on appeal.
<ul><li> A spectacularly successful example was the wrongful imprisonment of Deidre Rachid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> in 1997, with even the newly-elected British Prime Minister Tony Blair speaking up for the "Free Deidre" campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Soap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Soap">Soap</a></em>'s first season ends with the innocent Jessica being convicted of Peter's murder and sent to jail. She was freed when Chester suddenly confessed to the murder in question.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> has several cases where people are wrongfully imprisoned and spend years in jail before the detectives uncover the truth. In quite a few of these cases, the guys got railroaded thanks to prejudice of some kind while the real murderer seemed perfectly respectable.
<ul><li> A guy is exonerated <em>after</em> the other inmates murder him.
</li><li> The real killer in "Frank's Best" was the victim's son, who had anger issues; the apparent killer is an illegal immigrant.
</li><li> In "Thrill Kill", it was the mentally disturbed father of one of the victims; the blame was placed on two punk/outcast teenagers who were thought to have done it, as the title suggests, as a thrill killing.
</li><li> In "Death Penalty Final Appeal", it's one of the two movers who had moved the victim and her father into their new home; the other mover, who had a criminal record, was blamed and convicted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and executed before his name could be cleared. Fortunately, they manage to catch the real killer and exonerate him posthumously and the corrupt DA who withheld the evidence is fired and disbarred.</span>.
</li><li> One episode had someone confess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat">to cover for someone else he cared about</a>. The detectives knew this but didn't have enough evidence to prove it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles">The Rockford Files</a></em>. In the back story of the series, Jim Rockford was wrongly convicted of armed robbery and spent five years in prison before receiving a pardon.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>:
<ul><li> The A-Team were convicted of "A Crime They Didn't Commit" which was eventually revealed to be a bank robbery in Hanoi, Vietnam. In truth, they had been ordered to do it, but the man who gave them the order was killed and all evidence of his orders destroyed.
</li><li> In the fifth season premiere, they were cleared of <em>that</em> crime when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a former Vietnamese colonel testified in their court-martial that their commanding officer sent them to rob a bank in order for them to be captured by the North Vietnamese</span>. Of course, by that time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were being tried for the murder of their commanding officer, and the series ended before that could be resolved</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Crops up occasionally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>. Usually the wrongly convicted is either wholly unsympathetic (a white supremacist convicted of child murders that were actually committed by a mentally-ill black man) or turned out be connected after all (a man convicted of killing his wife turned out to have hired someone else to do it — he was convicted of murdering that man to cover this up). At least once, however, prosecutors <em>did</em> accidentally convict an innocent man, and found that their attempts to exonerate him were frustrated by their own successful prosecution, which, lacking any intentional impropriety or error, couldn't simply be reversed because they weren't sure the right man was convicted. A judge on appeal even tells them in effect "12 people looked at your evidence and said he was guilty, who am I to disagree?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>:
<ul><li> In an episode aptly titled "Justice Denied", it is revealed that Olivia unintentionally helped to convict a man of a crime he did not commit. The man was the prime suspect in a brutal rape, and after hours of interrogation, Olivia caught him in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">I Never Said It Was Poison</a> statement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">This and other circumstantial evidence is used to convict the man</a>. Years later, she realizes (due to a paperwork error that was repeated in the man's confession) that the man was innocent and that she must have provided him with the incriminating information earlier during the interrogation and forgotten about it. The man is freed but lost years of his life, and the real rapist was free to rape many more women in the meantime.
</li><li> It happened to Stabler's mentor. The suspected rapist had served his sentence and was released, so when similar rapes start happening, the immediate assumption is that the rapist is up to his old tricks. However, Stabler expresses skepticism that their suspect, a mentally disabled man, was capable of a crime of that complexity. His mentor is initially dismissive, but when he learns that the suspect has an alibi for the most recent crime, he realizes that Stabler was right; the suspect in question had been innocent all along. They then find that while the innocent man was in prison, the killer had committed similar crimes in other states, counting on the different jurisdictions to keep the police from putting it together.
</li><li> In one episode, Stabler finds out that a man he put in prison for rape was innocent after a similar crime was committed while the accused rapist was in prison. He goes to visit the guy in prison to eat his crow, apologize, and tell him as soon as they can get the real rapist before a judge, he'd be released. But then the real rapist jumps (or possibly is pushed) out of a window, which means they can no longer prove the convicted man's innocence.
<ul><li> A similar case occurs later in the same season, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> is averted when the man's lawyer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">violates privilege</a> to implicate her recently-deceased client in the crime, allowing the other man to be exonerated.
</li></ul></li><li> In season 15 episode "Dissonant Voices", a popular voice coach is framed as a pedophile by two of his ex-students <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for dropping them from his class</a>. Despite his numerous protests that he wasn't a child molester, Benson refuses to believe him, even thinking that he was just trying to claim sympathy when he said he couldn't make bail. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a> is eventually exposed, but the damage has already been done: the coach's family has disowned him, his reputation has been destroyed, and he'll never have a job again. Even worse, the two students who framed him end up getting probation at most. The episode ends with the coach giving the SVU a vicious but well-deserved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> before storming away angrily, while Benson has one of her rare moments of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">guilt-ridden</a> over arresting an innocent man.
</li><li> One case had a mother convicted of her infant daughter's death by a biased judge, despite the possibility of a medical explanation. After the same judge messes up an SVU case based on the same biases, Casey looks into his background and finds out about the mother's conviction, which she promptly fights to overturn.
</li></ul></li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> deals with this trope. Don responds to a crime that turns out to be identical to a previous case in which the suspect had taken a plea bargain. When they reexamine the case, they realize the evidence was a lot weaker than they had previously thought, but because the case didn't go to trial, the veracity of the evidence was never called into question. The real killer is identified when a connection between the victims is found, and the original suspect is released. (Compared to many victims of this trope, he ends up being relatively fortunate; he only serves a year before being exonerated.)
</li></ul><ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge">Porridge</a></em>, lifer Blanco Webb was wrongly convicted in 1957 for killing his wife. Fletch manages to get him pardoned and he was released, but it turns out he is guilty of murder, just not the murder he was convicted of.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Fletch:</strong> Listen, we all know that you didn't kill your old lady, see. Which means that some other bloke did. And you've paid the penance for it, right? But I don't want you going out there harbouring any thoughts of revenge, alright?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Blanco:</strong> No. I know 'im wot did it. It were the wife's lover. But don't worry, I shan't go round searching for him, 'e died years ago.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Blanco:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That I do know. It were me that killed him!</span>

She believes that if that happened, the boy's knowledge of what a monster his biological father was would taint his whole life. Therefore, she lets herself die as well.</span>
</li><li> The 2003 adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress">Sad Cypress</a></em> (it's an episode, part of a TV series). Only the adaptation, though. In the novel, the innocent person is found innocent, which is much less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">dramatic</a>.
</li><li> An innocent man spends 2 years and 8 months in prison in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> episode "True Grits".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Secrets" revolves around an escaped prisoner trying to prove his innocence.
</li><li> In "Retrial", a sailor had unbeknownst to him hired a transsexual prostitute. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">When finding out</a>, the sailor changed his mind and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossdresser">prostitute threatens him with a knife</a>. The sailor defends himself and accidentally stabs the prostitute and runs away in fear and shame. Not long thereafter, another man comes and viciously stabs the prostitute to death. The sailor is convicted for the murder, but only because the military prosecutor, presumably on purpose, didn't follow up on a lead from the local DA in order to further his own political ambitions as being "tough on crime".
</li></ul></li><li> A subplot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> episode "Identity Crisis" involved an innocent man sent to prison.

</li><li> The main theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Awake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Awake">Awake</a></em> episode "Guilty".
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WomensMurderClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WomensMurderClub">Womens Murder Club</a></em> featured a man who, seven years after being convicted for murder, would be executed for this. The case had a turn of events when the key witness is killed after sending an email admitting to have lied. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the prosecutor was secretly dating the victim and was so sure the defendant was guilty he blackmailed someone to give false testimony. In the end, the innocent was cleared, the murderer was caught and the prosecutor was arrested for tampering with the case. That case also featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>. When a DNA test confirmed the witness was killed by the same person who killed the original victim, nobody used that alone to stop the execution. The killer had to be caught first.</span>

Since Jor-El left no traces of his presence in Smallville, Tate needed another patsy. Clark dressed in clothes Jor-El left behind to pose as the drifter's ghost and scare a confession from Tate</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice">The Practice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Five years before DNA tests became available, Bobby Donnell defended an accused murderer who was forced by Kenneth Walsh to confess. Because Bobby believed his client to be guilty, the client had to wait ten years after DNA tests became available until an innocence program has the case reopened and the real culprit was revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone who had previously confessed out of remorse for seeing an innocent man being blamed but neither Bobby nor Walsh did anything about it. Out of remorse for not requesting the DNA test as soon as it became available, Bobby agreed to help his client sue the State</span>.
</li><li> In a later episode, police pick up two drifters in the wrong place at the wrong time for a cop shooting. Under powers expanded during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> era, they're able to torture a confession out of one of them. On top of that, the guy they didn't charge backs out of testifying for his friend when Eugene lets him know he could be considered a suspect himself.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> In his first appearance, convicted murderer Howard Epps convinced the Jeffersonian he was innocent and they tried to find proof of it in time to stop his execution. They found proof he was guilty not only of the murder he was convicted for but also the murder of other people. The execution had to be delayed to investigate the other murders.
</li><li> "The Nail in the Coffin" revealed The Ghost Killer's first murder resulted in this trope, and the wrongly convicted man in question eventually snapped and went on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against both her and the corrupt judge who convicted him.

Thankfully, she manages to escape the prison before her execution.
</li><li> The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InJustice">In Justice</a></em> revolved around clearing wrongfully convicted people. In episode 8, they fail to save a mentally disabled man from being executed because the judge feels that they don't yet have enough proof. It's sort of up in the air, since the episode ended with the detective confronting the real murderer (as well as the fact that the rest of the team knows who the killer actually is and persuaded the guy's wife to retract her alibi, meaning that they could have gathered enough evidence to nail him to a wall offscreen).

Here, activists worked on getting them exonerated with the help of the producers following up with <em>Paradise Lost 2</em> and soon, <em>Paradise Lost 3</em>, which drop the ambiguity of the first film and firmly support the three's innocence. They have since been released.
</li><li> <em>A Murder In the Park</em> has a disturbing twist on this. Anthony Porter was released in 1999 after a team of university students claimed to have found exculpatory evidence, including the confession of the real murderer. However, the film says, not only was Porter almost certainly guilty, but the man who confessed did so under coercion and manipulation from their private investigator. The man who confessed, Alstory Simon, was pressured to plead guilty by his lawyer to avoid a life sentence. His lawyer just so happened to be a friend of the same investigator who procured his confession. Simon got 37 years, though he was freed in 2014. So, if the film is correct, we have a killer wrongly set free and another man wrongly sent to prison later in his place, then himself exonerated. What is most damning is that per its allegations, the investigators seeking to exonerate Porter used many of the same tactics found in miscarriages of justice by the government: getting witnesses to change their stories with bribery or threats, coercing a false confession, and ignoring evidence implicating him in a double murder. Not only that but since Porter has been pardoned and the statute of limitations has run out on the investigators' crimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">no one can be prosecuted</a>. However, Simon sued them and the university, receiving an undisclosed settlement in 2018.

On April 19, 1989, investment banker Tricia Meili was savagely attacked in New York City's Central Park — beaten, raped, and left for dead. Within days, five young men — known as the Central Park 5 — who had been terrorizing people in the park were arrested. Despite no DNA evidence, no identification by Meili (she survived, but could not remember the attack), and a time frame that showed that the boys could NOT have assaulted the woman — ironically because they were attacking someone else at the time — all were convicted and sent to prison. A decade later, a man serving time for another crime came forward and confessed that he, and he alone, was the real perpetrator. There was nothing the DA's office could do but overturn the convictions of the others — who had all served their undeserved time. Meanwhile, the statute of limitations had run out, meaning that the man could not be prosecuted for the attack. So, 5 innocent young men spent a decade in prison for something they didn't do, a guilty man remained — and STILL remains — unpunished for something he did, and Meili will never see proper justice done. A thoroughly gross miscarriage of justice all around.

There was no physical evidence, the confessions were inconsistent, and what little did match up was already known by the police. They were sentenced to death (though Leon later had his sentence commuted to life in prison) in 1984. It wasn't until 2014, when DNA implicated a sex predator named Roscoe Artis (who lived 100 feet from where the little girl's body had been found, had been implicated in a similar murder a county over, and was convicted of murdering another young girl a month after the Brothers had been arrested in the same neighborhood) that the two were released.

</li><li> In one of the gravest public blunders of the Italian judiciary system, Enzo Tortora was wrongfully sentenced to ten years in prison after accusations of being a member of the Camorra involved in drug trafficking, based on paper-thin evidence and the claims of a mentally unstable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">pentito</a>.

</li><li> Perhaps the most infamous case in French history is Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who in 1894 was accused of spying for Germany.

The affair was unusual in that it really divided France into two clear sides: the <em>dreyfusards</em> (Dreyfus' defenders, mostly left-wing republicans) and the <em>anti-dreyfusards</em> (right-wing, traditionally religious conservatives). Dreyfus was pardoned in 1899 after five years of hell and officially exonerated in 1906.

In the course of reporting, the evidence is examined, and the conclusion is eventually drawn by reporter Sarah Koenig that the case against Adnan was based on either fundamentally flawed evidence (timelines that didn't match, evidence that ultimately was demonstrably incorrect), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> (witness testimony that changed with each telling, or that was left out entirely because it didn't fit the prosecution's case). She ultimately states that she doesn't know if Adnan is actually the killer, but there's no way he should be found guilty based on the evidence provided. The fact that Adnan has constantly pled his innocence for <em>15 years</em> despite it hurting his case and his chances at parole implies that this trope is in effect.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/archive/segment/539f3addfe3444d83f0005a5?cps=gravity_3831_9217036474751884442">A juvenile was sentenced to three consecutive life terms without parole for nonviolent offenses.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Fortunately, this was corrected, due to a change in the law, but the fact that it could happen shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">how messed up the law can be sometimes.</a>
</li><li> As discussed above under "Film", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenRillingtonPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenRillingtonPlace">10 Rillington Place</a></em> is based on the true story of John Christie, one of Britain's most prolific and notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killers</a>, who was the star witness at the trial which managed to see Timothy Evans, the husband and father of two of his victims, convicted and executed for the murders that Christie himself committed. When Christie's own crimes were exposed, the public outcry over this miscarriage was one of the key factors in the public movement which eventually resulted in Britain abolishing the death penalty for capital crimes.
</li><li> <em>Making A Murderer</em>, featuring Steven Avery. He was exonerated for rape and then convicted of murder. The documentary raises the possibility that the murder was another false conviction and that he and his nephew are innocent. Notably, even people who believe that Avery is guilty have come to concede that a lot of the evidence against him was probably planted, or at the very least that Branden (the nephew) is innocent.
</li><li> Roger Keith Coleman once seemed like the poster child for this trope. On March 10, 1981, Wanda McCoy was found raped, stabbed, and nearly beheaded in her own home, for which Coleman was convicted. The only real evidence that there was to go on were spots of blood on Coleman's pants and two male pubic hairs found on McCoy's body that were consistent with his own. Several witness accounts also placed Coleman as being other places at the time the crime occurred (also, the next-door neighbor was a serial rapist). While on death row, Coleman maintained that he was innocent and managed to gain numerous supporters, including Pope John Paul II. Shortly before his execution in 1992, he stated that "an innocent man is going to be murdered tonight." His supporters and anti-death penalty activists petitioned and lobbied for many years to have the evidence from the crime tested. Finally, in 2006, DNA testing finally confirmed that Coleman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">really was responsible for the crime.</a>
</li><li> The very first man exonerated by DNA testing in the US, Kirk Bloodsworth, was found guilty of rape and murder due to being mistakenly identified by eyewitnesses as the man they had noticed around the area (he resembled the real culprit). He was freed after eight years while having unknowingly been in a cell above the actual rapist and murderer (who was serving his sentence for another rape). The man wished him luck on his release (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">no, you can't make this stuff up</a>) and was later convicted of the crimes himself.
</li><li> Kevin Cooper is an unusual case in that DNA seems to condemn him, but there are compelling arguments that the DNA tests were sabotaged (a criminalist who had been caught lying on the stand had checked out an envelope containing one of the tested pieces of evidence and opened it three years before the testing was done, the cigarettes had changed size shape and color from the last time, and when a prosecution lab found results that seemed to confirm that blood had been planted on the shirt, they withdrew it on grounds of contamination but refused to submit the lab notes that could allow that claim to be verified). Whether he's this or not is up in the air, but there is still strong proof that some funny business was going on (notably when Cooper applied for an <em>en banc</em> hearing the results were a very narrow rejection that took 17 months to decide and which resulted in one of the judges writing a 100 page dissent accusing the judge of deliberately sabotaging Cooper's hearing, as well as the police of forging evidence.)
</li><li> Schapelle Corby, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">possibly</a>. She was convicted of smuggling marijuana to Indonesia but there were a lot of questionable things about the case, such as there being no camera footage available from the airport, the Judge presiding over her case apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">never having acquitted one person in over FIVE HUNDRED cases</a>, destruction of evidence and more. She was sentenced to 20 years in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Hellhole Prison</a> and many feared she wouldn't survive. Fortunately, she got her sentenced reduced eventually, was allowed out on probation (but still had to stay in Indonesia for five years) and, on May 17, 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">was finally allowed to return home to Australia</a>.
</li><li> In 2006, Bavarian man <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustl_Mollath">Gustl Mollath<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was accused by his wife of battering her, and was subsequently declared a criminally insane paranoiac in court. Only after <em>seven years</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAmongMadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAmongMadPeople">asylum hospitalisation</a> did it emerge that the allegations were completely baseless: his wife was a banker who was involved in handling clandestine Swiss bank accounts. When Mollath threatened to go public with it, she denounced him to a psychologist, prompting said psychologist to file a report that portrayed him as a violent lunatic. This report <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">would be regurgitated by a half dozen other independent experts, who would then proceed to cite each other as further evidence of Mollath's madness</a>. Lastly, the judge who issued the ruling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">turned out to be an acquaintance of a colleague</a> (and future husband) of Mrs. Mollath.
</li><li> In 2014, a couple in Russia was involved in a car accident, which resulted in the wife's death. The driver of the other car was drunk and was clearly the guilty party (his car crossed to the opposite lane). The drunk driver was arrested and found guilty of DUI and reckless driving and put in jail, also being ordered to pay compensation to the other driver (which he never did). Then the drunk driver's passenger (who had also been drinking before the driving) sued both drivers for compensation. The case was dismissed initially, as the court took into account the fact that the other driver was not at fault and himself never received compensation from the drunk driver. She filed for an appeal in a different area, and the second court ruled in her favor, so the innocent driver had to shell out a sizable sum to pay for someone who was partly responsible for his wife's death. How's that for justice?
</li><li> The case of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._McVay_III">Charles B. McVay III<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the only captain in the entire history of the U.S. Navy to receive a court-martial for the loss of his ship, the heavy cruiser <em>Indianapolis</em>. After delivering components for the atomic bombs to the Mariana Islands, <em>Indianapolis</em> made for the Philippines before being torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine <em>I-58</em> en-route. McVay and the majority of his crew spent five days lost at sea before being discovered, with only three hundred and sixteen out of nearly 1,100 surviving (the rest dying to injuries, exposure, lack of supplies, and near constant shark attack). McVay was charged with not calling for abandon ship in a timely manner, and failure to zigzag in event of a submarine attack. Despite scant evidence <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15s3j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15s3j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15s3j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">prosecution withheld a plethora of evidence that they had sent <em>Indianapolis</em> to its doom, such as covering up the loss of a destroyer on that same route to submarine attack and denying McVay escort ships</span>, expert testimony <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2aqj2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2aqj2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2aqj2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">numerous submarine captains, including the Japanese commander that had sunk <em>Indianapolis</em>, testified that even if McVay had zigzagged, they still would have been able to sink the cruiser with little difficulty</span>, and personal intersession from Naval Commander in Chief Nimitz, McVay was found guilty of failure to zigzag and his career was for all intents and purposes finished<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3uyhs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3uyhs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3uyhs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">McVay retired as a rear admiral in 1949 and committed suicide in 1968 due to a combination of loneliness and as a result of continuous harassment by relatives of those lost aboard <em>Indianapolis</em></span>. Survivors of the <em>Indianapolis</em> labored for years to try and overturn the court-martial, and eventually McVay was exonerated by President Clinton in October 2000.
