(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Often it happens</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">because of</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">those attempts</a>). It's as old as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing">Oedipus Rex</a></em>, used by Shakespeare and Tolkien, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">still fresh at least as recently as the mid-80s sitcom</a>!
</p><p>This trope will usually turn out one of three ways:
</p><p></p><ol><li>The event comes true exactly as expected. Depending on the mood of the series, the final fulfillment of the prophecy may or may not be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>. One technical term for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> version of this trope is the <em>predestination paradox</em>, a concept very popular with the Ancient Greeks, who believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotChangeTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotChangeTheFuture">You Cannot Change The Future</a>. There is only one possible future, and if you think otherwise, it's because you were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">destined</a> to take a different path. Sometimes, the heroes still manage to put right the wrong the prophecy promises. In such situations, they usually conclude that fate only said something bad would happen, not that they couldn't eventually right it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> usually follows about free will being stronger than destiny.
<p></p></li><li>The event comes true but not <em>quite</em> as expected. Usually this involves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a>, where the prophecy hinges on some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a> or metaphor that make it <em>technically</em> true. If it's the specific subtrope where a character cheats death only to die in a separate, but equally cruel and unusual, circumstances, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedDeathDiedAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedDeathDiedAnyway">Cheated Death, Died Anyway</a>.
<p></p></li><li>Everything does change, except for the one thing that the characters actually <em>want</em> to change. This is more common with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> stories, where a time traveller tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> (saving one particular loved one, hometown, etc.) but find that no matter how hard they try and how many times they time travel back, their attempts to do so still result in their loved one or hometown being gone. There might be an explanation involving some form of the grandfather paradox where the time traveller can't change that particular event because it's what led them to time travel in the first place; thus if they succeded they would never have started time traveling, which of course means that their loved one or hometown wouldn't have been saved. In any case, expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about how there's no use crying over spilt milk and that it's important to move on.

</p><p>If the prophecy comes true because of being made (in the most common scenario, because of everyone's attempts to prevent it), it's a case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>. If the universe appears to self-correct any attempt at change, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalInertia">Ontological Inertia</a> is in play.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince">½ Prince</a></em> a different kind of fate takes place when it comes to NPCs in Second Life. The game is programmed for things to happen, which is explored in a rather sad tale when Prince meets two NPCs on the Eastern Continent. Prince has to complete a quest by taking Kenshin the demon lord to see his game-programmed lover, but they find her grave. Even though the game was programmed for this to happen, because Kenshin developed a conscience it made it a very sad experience for him, because to kenshin it was as if she really did exist and she'd waited for him until the end of her days.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, fate is described as an unbreakable law of nature. Several people and Stands predicting the future are always correct, at least technically because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> still applies. However, the series presents it in a better light because: 1. the heroes' struggle still has a meaning as despite their destinies, they all make a conscious choice to fight evil at the risk of their lives; 2. sometimes, good is meant to triumph at the end.
<ul><li> Will Zepelli, from Part 1, subverts this trope in that he's given more or less the exact circumstances of his death, but makes no move to avert it because his death will help achieve his ultimate goal. Instead, he demands to know the manner of his death so he can plan on how to live from then on.
</li><li> Two of the Stands, Bohemian Rhapsody and Under World, actually manage to turn this into a <em>weapon</em>. Bohemian Rhapsody fates people to re-enact stories that they have particular attachments to. This turns downright ugly, or even <em>fatal</em>, if the character they're most like met an unpleasant and/or deadly end. Under World, meanwhile, fates people to live through an unearthed memory of their current location (which its Stand user uses to trap the heroes in the memory of a crashing airplane). Under World is a little more flexible because Donatello's victims aren't necessarily incorporated into the memory like Bohemian Rhapsody incorporates victims into stories. This means it's possible to circumvent the bad portions of a memory, as long as you wouldn't keep the memory from repeating its original form.
</li><li> A third (and notably dangerous) example is Yoshikage Kira's Bites the Dust, which uses this in combination with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>. It causes somebody to explode, rewinding time by one hour. When it gets to the point in time where Bites the Dust originally activated, fate sets in motion and the target dies again.
</li><li> Boingo's Stand, Thoth, takes the form of a comic book that predicts the immediate future. These predictions are boasted by Boingo as being 100% absolute. While this is true, they are also highly prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twists</a>; especially if someone actively tries to avoid the predictions of the book. For example, when Boingo's brother Oingo is about to be caught planting a trap that Thoth has prophecised will blow up Jotaro, he uses his Stand to transform himself <em>into</em> Jotaro to escape detection and ends up being the one who is injured in the trap. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, one of Thoth's predictions shows Jotaro's face being split in half with "blood everywhere". While this doesn't happen immediately, 22 years later, Jotaro is killed by Enrico Pucci's Stand Made In Heaven. The scenario? His face is split in half.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, this is embodied in the sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> who is actually named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Fate</a>". She feels that she has no choice in her life and in her actions, and thus no hope. Ironically, this is her power at first, as her ruthlessness (as there are no other options to her) gives her the edge. The Heroine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">contemplates a few times</a> on how she, on the other hand, <em>chose</em> to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a>, because it's something she wants to be. (Rather rare; most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> are that way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>.) Thus, Fate and Nanoha's battle in the first season is symbolic of Fate vs. Free Will.
<ul><li> Which means that with enough firepower, you cannot only Fight Fate, but you can also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">befriend Fate</a>. Befriend her right into the hospital. Then start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed">sharing a bed</a> with her in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">a few years</a>...
<ul><li> And if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">Word of Gay</a> is anything to go by, the term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">"screwing fate"</a> takes on a whole new level of meaning.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, it's possible to fight Fate. But look out, he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turn people to stone</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> is around 3,000, so...what? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">Wrong Fate?

</li><li> And in the most recent chapter, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>there are six of him</em>, two of which are unaccounted for.

</li><li> Sartorius (Takuma Saiou) was always talking about this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> when he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Aster (Edo) Phoenix did a bit, too, although this is more in the dub (where his catchphrase is "You can't fight destiny").
<ul><li> The original series, at least in the dub, had a lot of this with talk about things being fated to happen, the character named Ishizu Ishstar was the main instigator of this. Being the keeper of the millennium necklace, which grants her the power to see the future, she would accurately prophesize the great battle between good and evil, and would warn the main cast of the terrible things to come. She was also the one to reveal to Yugi and his friends of his ancient past and his greater destiny, she attempted to do the same with seto kaiba but kaiba practically mocks her every single time and always screwed destiny. Even after she gives away her necklace, Ishizu continues to prophesize the coming battle, so, so much, its like her most common dialogue. The 2nd season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> went with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> with Jaden (Judai) having the power to defy fate. Somewhat similar deal with talk between Goodwin and Yusei in 5Ds.
</li><li> Judai's rival in the second series Edo Phoenix was a moderate example. At first, he believed Saiou's predictions and that this Trope was true (mostly because they turned out in his favor) but once Judai started to defy those predictions, he started to have his doubts, until finally deciding that if Fate existed at all, it was not written in stone. (Curiously, Edo's Destiny Hero monsters have effects that suggest altering time and destiny for the player's benefit, so it seems odd that Edo ever believed that the future could not be changed.
</li><li> This situation came up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal">Yu-Gi-Oh!

Renton and Eureka meeting each other and falling in love, as well as them being together ever after, is also proven by the events in both TV series and movie to be a destined thing. One good example is Eureka being always able to make a come back in some form in the ending and stay with Renton, one way or another (Tv, movie, manga). There's a dialogue said by Talho in the movie when Renton reunites with Eureka after 8 years: "A first-timer breaking through a net of monsters...Is this just a coincidence?

When they fail to kill him, the present Wildcats and Spawn agree to go with them into the future to defeat the Ipsissimus, but it turns out this was part of a predestination paradox, as the Ipsissimus uses the opportunity to give Spawn the medallion that corrupted him and caused him to turn evil to begin with.

He later learns the true reason <em>Darth Vader</em> was so interested in this case: the rogue officer had in his possession the severed (but still alive) head of an alien seer. Every prediction she makes comes true, no matter what. She predicted that Boba Fett would kill the rogue officer, and despite his attempts to avert his death, it comes to pass. Boba Fett was wise enough to refuse to listen to anything she has to say, claiming that he would make his own future. The only plans he has for her is to auction her off. Boba Fett eventually loses the seer to Vader. The seer warns Vader against trying to exploit her power by first showing him two false visions. The first depicted Vader being brought to Palpatine in chains, accused of treachery, and casually shocked to death with Force Lightning. The second depicted Vader triumphantly slicing Palpatine in half. The seer explained that she spared Vader the truth because she hoped he would kill her. In the end, he does kill her to keep her away from Palpatine...just as she predicted.

In the end, his efforts to change his fate became the very beginning of his downfall (Shen's parents banished him for it) and sets up the chain of events that will fulfill this prophecy.
<ul><li> "One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it."
</li><li> The Soothsayer does acknowledge that this will only happen if Shen continues on his current path. So he <em>could</em> fight fate, he just tried to fight the wrong part of it.
</li><li> Extra irony points because Po, the one destined to defeat him, doesn't even know that Shen EXISTS until a week before he fights him. Shen assumes that Po is looking for revenge for the deaths of his parents and his entire people, when as far as Po knows, he's only there because Shen stole a bunch of pots and took over a city on the other end of China and has no external reasons for vengeance.
</li><li> Also worth noting is that as an albino peacock, Shen himself is a black-and-white warrior. All the events of the film that conspire to bring about his doom are things that he directly or indirectly set into motion.

Ultimately, he failed to prevent Padmé's death. Not only did he fail to prevent Padmé's death, he was the direct cause of it. She "gave up on life" because she had lost him to the dark side.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> films, as a whole, are an example of this.

<ul><li> Then there's Skynet's attempts to avert it's own destruction by repeatedly sending Terminators back in time to stop John Connor from being born or kill him. Not only does it's Terminators never succeed, they are indirectly responsible for multiple attempts to prevent the existance of Skynet. Worst of all, The Sarah Connor Chronicles shows by sending him into the future that even if John Connor wasn't a factor there would still be a Resistance there fighting Skynet anyway, so killing John Connor wouldn't have actually made a difference.

A group of friends discover that their neighbor was a scientist who built a camera that can take pictures of the future.

One of the best-known of these stories is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories">The Histories</a></em> of Herodotus. While Herodotus has many stories of inevitable fates (reflecting the ancient Greek worldview), one story is still widely known 2500 years later. Herodotus reports that when Croesus, King of Lydia (a country in western Anatolia—now Turkey—which was one of the Great Powers of its day, and famous for its wealth) sent a massive convoy to the Oracle at Delphi carrying literal tons of gold, silver, and other luxuries to ask the Oracle a question: Should Croesus attack the Persians? And the Oracle famously answered: "If Croesus attacks the Persians, he will destroy a great empire." Croesus apparently read that to mean he would win, and proceeds to attack the Persians. Problem is, the Persians are led by this guy named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat">Cyrus</a>, and he beats the snot out of the Lydians, taking their whole empire and capturing Croesus (whom he makes an advisor). But the Oracle was right—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Croesus did destroy a great empire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">just not the one he was thinking of</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeforeIFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeforeIFall">Before I Fall</a></em>, after dying in a car crash while leaving a party, Samantha is forced to relive the last day of her life. No matter what, at 12:39 am, she always dies (or starts over on the same day), and she finds that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Juliet Sykes always kills herself, until Samantha jumps in front of her, thus ending the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>.</span>

It takes a god with a stare to die for to change her mind. The series makes a point of driving this home with a large hammer. Numerous times Polgara and Belgarath say that "Everything has already been decided." Which turns out to be true. Even minor, never to be seen again characters were born just for one particular purpose (such as the soldier heckling Ce'Nedra when she needs prodding to make an important speech).
<ul><li> Possible lampshading in the related books <em>Belgarath the Sorcerer</em> and <em>Polgara the Sorceress</em>. In those books, the titular characters spend thousands of years on assorted errands to ensure that the prophecy <em>will</em> be fulfilled. For example, Belgarath and Polgara practically dictated a major treaty to a sovereign power at swordpoint to make sure that, 500 years later, Ce'Nedra would be sent to Riva.
<ul><li> Definite lampshading in the former. The Prophecy's method of revealing information (concealing it in cryptic words until the right moment) is a necessary ploy to keep Belgarath (who hates the implications this trope) from doing things he's not supposed to.
</li></ul></li><li> While the characters can't fight their fates, at the same time, the core of the plot actually concerns two competing prophecies. One prophecy triumphing ultimately means the other gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">screwed</a>.
</li><li> It's later revealed that it's <em>possible</em> to escape both fates. But it would make the universe go so far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> that the "third fate"'s outcome is unpredictable, and neither side is willing to risk that rather than accomplish the Prophecy that's good for them.

That part goes fine, but the princess quickly discovers that everyone is still <em>acting</em> like she died, with mourning colors being raised in the halls and repeatedly forgetting about the princess even when she's standing right there.

</li><li> Later, Rincewind sees Death, who's surprised to meet the failed wizard, since he has an appointment with Rincewind the next day in another city. Death even offers to lend Rincewind a fast horse, but wisely he doesn't take up the offer. (This is Pratchett's take on an old Arab legend - see below under Myth &amp; Folklore.)

He copes with all this by thinking of events being just as much historical facts if they happened yesterday or will happen in the future.

Due to the pre-destined nature of events, even seeing an Augur's vision of the future will not enable anyone to change what is destined to happen. It's a series-spanning debate whether this means life is meaningless or whether free will isn't required for meaning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmMordred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmMordred">I Am Mordred</a></em>: Morgan le Fay believes this, and explicitly warns Mordred that no matter what, he'll never be able to avert the prophecy about him.

It turns out that the Pevensie children are indeed the prophesized four. Although the White Witch tried to kill them to maintain her rule over Narnia, the siblings successfully defeat her and become the sworn protectors of Narnia.

In keeping with the heavy ties to Greek Mythology, all prophecies in the story come to pass in some form or another. Trying to avoid or fight off destiny only results in either nothing happening, or worse causing the prophecy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">come true in the attempt to change it</a>. That being said the prophecies themselves are very cryptic, and as a result are open to several, sometime positive, interpretations. (In fact, in the second series, Zeus refuses to accept the excuse of acting solely to help bring a prophecy to fulfillment as excuse, saying that there are always several ways to read them and for them to come true and actively trying to make sure they do happen in the way you think they will limits the possibilities.)

For example, when the astrologers predict that a force attacking the heroes will fail and reinforcements will be necessary, they won't just strengthen the first force - because they're afraid that acting contrary to the stars' predictions will curse them. In another case, a wolf-headed woman leaves the protagonist be instead of fighting him, because she had no victories or losses predicted by the astrologers for that day.

Most except Jupiter, who orders his lessers to carry out the decrees of Fate or suffer the wrath of his thunderbolt. Unable to challenge the king of the universe, all the unhappy gods can do is delay the inevitable:
<ul><li> Juno is the most successful at fitting fate to her designs, since she leverages Jupiter's many adulteries to make him concede that Argos shouldn't be totally destroyed.
</li><li> Venus stops Mars from rousing the Argive army by breaking into tears in front of his chariot and waxing poetic about how Thebes' destruction will end the bloodline of their child Cadmus. Not wanting to upset his lover, Mars lets the men of Argos laze around for a week or two before Jupiter makes him stop procrastinating.
</li><li> Bacchus orders all his nymphs to dry up their rivers with the exception of one near Nemea. This forces King Adrastus to take his men their and sets up a chain of events that delays the war another few weeks.

The first time it happened — he touched something and received the premonition that he would never touch it again — he immediately tried to prove the premonition wrong, and not only failed but got his hand horribly disfigured instead.

He had known that he'd be attacked by a badger and nearly die, but even with expecting it to happen he was unable to do anything. He also had a vision of his Clanmates starving around him, and tried to prevent it by coming up with a strategy to "refrigerate" prey in the frozen ground, but the plan failed due to the weather and several of his Clanmates starved to death.

<ul><li> The series had its own tendency to mess with this concept. "Gettysburg" is a great example. A mysterious time traveler, who had appeared in previous episodes, returns. However, this time, instead of attempting to arrange "justice" against villains from the past while remaining consistent with recorded history, he is attempting to directly change what happened. Specifically, he hopes to avoid the assassination of the first black president in 2013, regarded as one of America's greatest leaders, by a Southern Sympathizer whose beliefs are all tied up in the Glory of the Confederacy. The time traveler sends the guy back from a Gettysburg re-enactment to the real battle where he serves under an insane commander and faces the true harshness of the war and his supported side. He learns his lesson, and comes face-to-face with his ancestor, whose self-serving cowardice contradicts the impressive legend that he had idolized during his youth, and he rejects extremism and the no-longer noble rebellion against the government. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, the insane commander from Gettysburg is accidentally transported to the 2013 date and, while trying to kill "Lincoln" (in truth, an impersonator at the memorial event), manages to assassinate the president anyway.</span>

It happened the next year instead. To say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">the war</a> ended well is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">lying</a>.
<ul><li> For a Sentai example, the original Sixth Ranger Burai of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</a></em> is told shortly after his introduction that he will die in 40 hours. This can be halted for awhile so long as he doesn't try to fight the bad guys but he needs to save the others often and whenever he does more of his remaining time ticks away. Every moment he appears in has somebody trying to find a way to prevent this, but they eventually find out that no, not even the gods can save him, his time has come. Sure enough he dies shortly before the finale, although he managed to make peace with himself and his impending death and dies with no regrets.
<ul><li> Another variant for another Sentai is another Sixth Ranger of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger">Mirai Sentai Timeranger</a></em> TimeFire who is also destined to die. Here it's not as specific. TimeFire will die, but as the ranger and not the person, meaning anybody could fulfill this destiny as TimeFire. The original TimeFire found this out and did his best to make sure somebody else took over for him ASAP. Sure enough the new TimeFire dies in the battle he was destined to die in, but the original's selfish scheme is discovered by the other Rangers, who promptly kill him anyway.

In each episode, Sam's goal was to fight a particular piece of fate, and he invariably won.

For example, in <em>MIA</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Al lied to Sam about what his goal was, and had him try to stop Al's own wife Beth from remarrying while he was a prisoner of war.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episode "Cassandra" provided a perfect example with a computer that could tell the future. After it had foretold that certain characters would be left alive, a gun was pointed in their face and the trigger pulled; naturally, it jammed. When pointed at another character who she foretold would die, it worked perfectly. This trope was then used almost word for word to seduce another character, since the computer had foretold he'd die while having sex with her. (When her boyfriend caught them in the act) But in the end, it turned out she was lying to cause jealousy. She foresaw that the boyfriend would kill her. He realized this and tried to avoid it, saying he wasn't going to kill her, but through a Rube Goldberg series of events ends up killing her anyway.
<ul><li> Lister, who was foretold would kill Cassandra, wasn't dating Kochanski but it was foretold that he would kill Arnold with a harpoon gun as 'Rimmer' died of a heart attack after being told he would, but it was actually the captain of the squad wearing Rimmer's jacket with Rimmer's name on it. This was Rimmer's attempt at screwing destiny. This was all part of Cassandra's scheme as she knew she would die and rather sees 'visions' of the future rather than actual predictions as some of her 'predictions' are unclear even to her and thus attempts to take down whoever she can before she dies.
</li><li> Future Echoes. Each character sees "future echoes" which are events happening in the future, which will happen to the characters at some point as the ship is going past light speed. As they go faster past it, the echoes are in the more distant future. At one point, Lister sees the Cat with a broken tooth. Lister runs off to find the Cat to prevent it, and just as the Cat is about to eat the robotic fish inside the tank (which would break his tooth), the two struggle, with Lister trying to stop the Cat eating the fish. In this struggle, the Cat knocks his tooth off a corner of the ledge where the tank is, thereby breaking his tooth anyway.

<ul><li> The ancient Greeks <em>loved</em> these types of stories:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Gaia and Ouranos</a> prophesied that Kronos would be overthrown by one of his children, so he ate each child as it was born (that's both sons and daughters, just to be clear). His wife kept their last son, Zeus, hidden, so that Zeus could eventually fulfill the prophesy (as told in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Theogony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Theogony">Theogony</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod">Hesiod</a>).
</li><li> It was prophesied that Achilles, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>, was to die young in battle. His mother, Thetis, attempted to defy this prophecy by dipping his body in the River Styx, attempting to render him invincible, but holding Achilles by the heel, which proved to be his one weakness. His father, Peleus, sent him to train with Chiron, and gave him a suit of bronze armor. Unfortunately, all of his prowess in battle was not enough to prevent a spear or arrow from striking Achilles on the heel and his dying at a young age as prophesied
</li><li> Sisyphus, who tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithFightingDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithFightingDeath">cheat death for as long as possible</a>, when Thanatos, the Greeks' equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>, came to summon Sisyphus to Tartarus, the dark, abyssmal pit section of the Underworld reserved for big-time offenders. Just as Thanatos came to Sisyphus' door, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu">he locked Thanatos in chains after asking him for a demonstration</a>. Other versions have Sisyphus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">knocking Thanatos unconscious with a heavy object, like a huge pestle or millstone</a>, with Ares watching the warriors slashing at each other with their swords bloody and wounded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">but never dying because Sisyphus held an unconscious Thanatos captive in his house</a>.

</li><li> Oedipus and his story revolve around this trope: He was prophesied to slay his father and wed his mother. It is an especially ironic example because after receiving the same prophecy his parents received and abandoned him for, Oedipus in turn exiles himself away from his foster father for fear of killing him, with no suspicion that his adoptive parents are not his real parents. In short, everything that the characters do to avoid the prophecy is necessary to make the prophecy come true.
</li><li> Two other famous cases involve the Oracle at Delphi; in the first, a man prophesied to die in the sea spends his life avoiding the <em>ocean</em>, only to die in a forest the locals call "The Sea"; another is the Croesus story reported with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistories">The Histories</a></em> under Literature above.
</li><li> Another example is Meleager, who was fated to die young, specifically when a log of firewood burned out. His mother took the log and hid it away, and Meleager grew up to be a well-respected hero. But during the Calydonian Boar Hunt, he murdered his uncles in a rage after they insulted his martial prowess. His mother was furious and threw the log into the fire, and Meleager died.
</li><li> This (plus it being an accident) was actually the reason Perseus pretty much got away with a slap on the wrist for killing his grandfather Acrisius. See, said grandfather, a king, received a prophecy that if his daughter, Danae, was ever to have a son, that son would kill him. So the king locked his daughter into a room to prevent any men from getting to her (as she wasn't pregnant yet). Zeus however heard her cries and next thing you know, Danae was pregnant by a shower of gold. When the baby, named Perseus<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3pndo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3pndo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3pndo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">meaning "avenger" or "destroyer"</span> was born, the king put the mother and the baby in a wooden box or casket and had it dropped into the sea. Zeus pulled strings with his brother Poseidon and together they ensured the two got a safe landing at an island. Said island's ruler wanted Danae as wife but Perseus refused to allow it (in lieu of a father or husband, he was Danae's closest male relative even if he was her son) so Perseus got sent on an assumed suicide mission to get Medusa's head. After he did and he freed Danae plus princess Andromeda, who he married, Perseus returned to his mother's homeland to find his grandfather the king ran away in terror at the news of his arrival. He took the throne that was rightfully his and ruled happily, then one day, partaking in the games in another city, the discus he meant to throw accidentally hit an old beggar living near on the streets. That beggar? <em>Perseus' grandfather</em>.

It's interesting to note that "<em>rök</em>" not only means "<em>fate</em>" but also "<em>development</em>", "<em>cause</em>" and surprisingly "<em>origin</em>".
</li><li> An ancient Arab legend tells about a man who saw Death staring at him and fled to faraway Samarra to avoid him. When somebody asked Death why he'd been staring at the man he said, "I was surprised to see him here because I'm appointed to meet him in Samarra next week."

They try, but it catches up no matter what they do. In the end the prince, his sister/wife, and their son die.
</li><li> The concept of predestination, which is common in Western Christianity, especially in Calvinist denominations, less so in Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism, but also in Islam. While the idea that the ultimate fate of every human being is <em>foreknown</em> by God is accepted by most, "Predestination" is normally associated with the idea that God picks who he will save <em>completely</em> independently of what that person does or believes in life, i.e., no one actually has any true choice or free will in choosing or rejecting God and their final fate in the afterlife, it's all just destiny and what God wants to do with them. The reason given is usually that salvation is a freely given gift, and not something one can earn, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">actually even being capable of accepting the gift on one's own accord being considered "earning it" somehow.</a> Many have pointed out, including many other Christian denominations, that this belief is essentially saying God is deliberately choosing to screw over most of the world, and that it completely negates the whole "God allows suffering and evil to exist because we all must have free will" argument used by most Christian denominations.

Regardless of anything else, players must either make a roll from secret table or outright leave it to GM's decision what will be the Fate of their characters. Fate remains secret for players and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Story-tellers</a> are obligated to create such plot stucture that will eventually lead to fulfilment of it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> generally averts this trope- pretty much anyone or anything capable of using Essence can alter Fate, and the mere presence of a creature from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Outside Fate</a> can cause a disruption in the Loom of Fate.

<ul><li> Played with by <em>samsara,</em> the nebulous order that exists above and beyond Fate which the Maidens of Destiny may look to in order to foresee the future. The upside is that <em>samsara</em> is far more accurate as a predictive tool than Fate; the downside is that the Maidens are compelled to act in accordance with <em>samsara</em> whenever they view it. For this reason, they try not to use that particular power that much. Also, unlike Fate, samsara has no active power - except that the only beings that can perceive it (the Maidens) are also bound to bring about its predictions.

When the two eventually fought, Makuta ended up drawing in the two fragments in an attempt to attack Mata Nui, one of which hit him in the back of the head and killed him. Thanks to Makuta pulling the planet chunks closer, Mata Nui is able to finish the job on his own.</span>
<ul><li> Prior to that Makuta actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">exploited this to his advantage</a>: He had put Mata Nui to sleep, but a group of Toa heroes were destined to wake him up again. Rather than try to stop the heroes at all costs, he arranged things so that reviving Mata Nui could give him even more power.
</li><li> Even earlier, both Mata Nui and Makuta tried to exploit this at the same time. Mata Nui determined which Matoran would become the Toa Metru, and a prophecy of their identities leaked out. The prophecy was quickly surpressed, but not before Makuta learned of it. He then tricked Toa Lhikan into deciding that the prophecized Matoran were not the ones truly destined to be Toa and caused Lhikan to pick six others who Lhikan thought would do the job. These six were, in fact, chosen by Makuta as six who would never be able to work together and therefor fail (and even if by some miracle they did succeed, he could at least have the satisfaction of knowing he screwed Mata Nui over). These six became the Toa and Makuta seemingly won (at least for a little while). Future averted, right? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nope. The prophecy was a lie created by Mata Nui for just such an occasion. The six Matoran Makuta planted in Lhikan's mind were in turn planted into HIS mind by Mata Nui, thus allowing those truly destined to take the power.</span> Not bad for a guy who was asleep most of the series.

The best example of this, though, is that Nozdormu <em>also</em> knows that he will eventually become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">Murozond</a>, the leader of the Infinite Dragons who are screwing with history.

This only applies to the corrupted orcs, however, as Grommash remains uncorrupted and Draenor itself escapes its main universe counterpart's fate of being split into Outland.

</div><ul><li> Offshoots don't always veer off into non-existence though, as sometimes Paradox Space finds ways to make sure that all parties that would be altered in the new timeline meet a swift demise, as a Dave and one set of Trolls found out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">way</a>.
</li><li> It also doesn't help the issue that we as the reader know the future, but characters in canon do not.
<ul><li> In short, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> not only can you not fight fate, if you do manage to split away from the main timeline, a quasi magical force known as Paradox Space will doom you all to a horrible death. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Probably</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, this only applies to major characters; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Miss Exposition</a> claims that the universe only really cares that much about the actions of people who will have a major impact on the universe itself and its survival/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reproduction</span>, while those without potential for such impact have traditional free will and the universe will not split into a doomed timeline regardless of their choices.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John</span> is the only person able to actually fight this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as since he's no longer tied down to the basic causality of the Incipisphere, his actions as he flits across time and space can actually change the alpha timeline. Considering how narrowly the kid's made it out alive, this is more than a little scary for him.</span>
</li><li> This also a major reason why nobody ever tries preventing the rise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Lord English, who doesn't even make a proper appearance in the comic until very late. Every time the possibility of mucking with time to prevent his arrival is raised, someone iterates that "You can't. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">He is already here.</a>"
</li><li> And when the above two examples are mixed together, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it still ends up that this trope is played straight. Even when John teleports the Kids in using his Retcon powers to stop Lord English's younger self before he can become Lord English, it still ends up being the event that creates him anyways.</span>
</li><li> It really doesn't help that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord English is <em>also</em> able to manipulate Fate for his own ends, being a Lord of Time who gained game-breaking powers thanks to playing and beating a Dead Session. The very juju that granted John his power was originally Caliborn's.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is Wanda's philosophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld">Erfworld</a></em> after her and Jillian's experiences with trying to fight Fate just made things harder on them. Wanda chose to submit to Fate and became rather stoic and hopeless as a result, but generally gets what she wants. Jillian herself keeps fighting Fate despite the futility and is usually happier and more fulfilled even though she always seems to end up suffering and losing eventually. So, who won?
<ul><li> Later, an actual Predictamancer calls Wanda's worldview simplistic after it causes yet another screw up. Fate itself is a part of the world of magical disciplines and clever people can get around it or stall it for a time if they know how. Tricking a prophecy, moving the goal conditions further along and bizarre strategies that ensure maximum safety and no risk. The best people to cheat Fate are usually Carnymancers, but even they lose in the end. To beat the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">strongest known Carnymancer, Charlie,</span> though, Wanda needs to stop being so inflexible and start searching for loopholes herself.
</li><li> Theoretically, one could prevent a prophecy by killing the person that the prophecy is about, but on the occasions when somebody actually had the opportunity to do this, they were to scared to try because they believed that fate would retaliate by sending somebody worse to fulfil the prophecy.

It says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Trigon</a> comes to claim, he comes to sire the end of all things mortal", thus correctly predicting what Trigon <em>intends</em> to do. It never says that he succeeds.
</li></ul></li><li> In "The End, Part II", Robin calls Slade out on helping Trigon destroy the world. Slade responds that while he <em>did</em> play a part in it, even if he wasn't there, it wouldn't have changed anything. Trigon's coming was inevitable.
</li><li> Season 2's episode "How Long is Forever?" has Starfire sent 20 years into the future during a battle with a time-traveling villain named Warp. In the future, her friends split apart after her absence and Warp tells her, despite believing his interference caused it, that nothing has changed, as everything is as history says it is. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">reuniting her friends proves otherwise.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JacobTwoTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JacobTwoTwo">Jacob Two-Two</a></em> starts with Jacob accidentally destroying his older brother's priceless, never-been-played Beatles record, and discovering a time machine that will let him go back to when he broke it. But every single time he tries to fix it, things turn out <em>worse</em>, culminating in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">complete destruction of their entire house</a></em>.</span> And the record gets destroyed in all instances. Jacob finally gives up trying to save the record, and uses the time machine one last time to recreate the original incident (where just the record is broken and nothing else). And then he happens upon another copy of <em>I Want To Hold Your Hand</em>. Yay! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">And then Daniel accidentally breaks that copy, too.</a></span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> Fry kills his own grandfather, but turns out to be his own grandfather after all (explaining his unusual brain structure, or lack thereof), so the Futurama timespace seems to be either impossible to change, or self-correcting.
<ul><li> Doom coefficient, anyone?
</li></ul></li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheSeries">Aladdin: The Series</a></em> episode has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of Chaos convinced that Fate is on Aladdin's side after hearing about his many victories against impossible odds. This upsets him, to say the least, and that's when the episode gets a little more serious.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chaos:</strong> To always win against such odds, Fate must have smiled on you. <br/><strong>Aladdin:</strong> Well, I try not to...brag... <br/><strong>Chaos:</strong> But I never liked Fate. Predestination goes against the grain. Besides, he cheats at cards. But if Fate has decreed that Aladdin always wins, what can I do? I mean, wheres the unpredictability in that? Ive got it! Allow me to produce a little scenario I call "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>". I have no problem with Aladdin winning all his battles. The question is, which Aladdin?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode has Twilight Sparkle meeting her future self, who has messed-up hair, a torn-up catsuit, an eyepatch, and a scar. Because Present Twilight talks so much, Future Twilight can't deliver a warning about the future, so Present Twilight panics and tries to prevent a potential disaster, not only causing the changes her future self wound up with, but it turns out there was no disaster in the first place. The warning was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">to not worry about what the future brings.</a>
</li><li> In the season 3 finale, Twilight's main friends have had their Cutie Marks accidentally switched by the former and are forced to perform the task each Cutie Mark brings, it being their supposed fate to do so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted when everything goes back to normal.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, one episode shows the Flash's grandson Impulse going back in time through a one-way time machine to prevent his grandfather from being killed by a supervillain named Neutron which he believes will prevent the world from being devastated by Neutron's uncontrollable power. He succeeds in saving Flash and also eliminating Neutron's power with a blue pill that the future Neutron gave him. Neutron is changed by Impulse's actions, but the world continues to be devastated.
<ul><li> However, he <em>does</em> later help change the outcome of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Reach invasion; by helping prevent Blue Beetle's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, the Reach are ultimately prevented from taking over Earth like they did in Impulse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>.</span> The season finale (which until the revival was thought to be the last episode) suggests that there <em>would</em> be other threats to the Earth that might lead to the same (or similar) outcome, but until Season 3, this can't be known for certain.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, Odd's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindofLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindofLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">very useful</a> ability to see the future provides endless examples of this. The first season seems pretty convinced that his real superpower is watching things like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yumi falling into the Digital Sea</span> without actually doing anything to change the future, until Jérémie finally realizes how useless it is and doesn't bother coding it back after an update erased it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, at every alternate universe shown so far, some event happens that makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">Finn lose an arm:</a> his life in the Pillow World, a world where he had wished the Lich never existed, visions of the future, and his previous life as Shoko. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As of "Escape from the Citadel", this happens to Main!Finn canonically. He seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> by getting it back a few episodes later...only to lose it <em>again</em> not long after, forcing him to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">a robotic one</a> for the rest of the series. You really <em>can't</em> fight fate here.</span>
</li><li> Jughead lampshades this trope in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries">Archie's Weird Mysteries</a></em>, which involves Archie experiencing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> due to time travel shenanigans, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> where he gets a milkshake dumped on him. Though after sorting things out, Archie still delivers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> with his closing narration.
<div class="indent"> "I can tell you from personal experience that time travel is overrated. For a while there, I was beginning to believe that Jughead was right, that you really <em>can't</em> fight fate. But when I took charge of the situation, I proved that a bad day is just a bad day, even if you have to repeat it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">in a little town called Riverdale.</a>"

While she really does like him, she realizes that her feelings can't compare to what's happening between him and Kai — added with the knowledge from Spanner that the two are married in the future, she realizes that there's no point in fighting for him anymore since Ben and Kai are <em>meant</em> to be together.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode "The Time Travelers Pig" has Dipper getting a time-traveling device in order to go back in time and not hit Wendy in the eye with a baseball. But it's shown that no matter how many times Dipper goes back in time, he will always hit Wendy and she'll always start dating Robbie. The one timeline where he doesn't hit Wendy also prevents Mabel from getting her pet pig. Dipper decides that he can't take away Mabel's happiness and goes back in time to help Mabel win her pig, but also lose Wendy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> heavily discusses this.
