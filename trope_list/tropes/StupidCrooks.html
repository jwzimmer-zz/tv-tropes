Those who canÂ’t pull off anything on that scale may think smaller, plan a less rewarding crime with fewer risks involved.
</p><p>This trope is for those who fail even at that.
</p><p>Criminals in general are seldom the brightest of folks in the first place, but there's something about Stupid Crooks that always distinguishes them from the rest of the pack. Naturally, the very fact that they seek to commit acts of crime doesn't win them any favors or admiration from anyone, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">the fact that they can't even succeed at it</a> doesn't do them any good, either.

When a Jerkass is also an idiot, it's even <strong>more</strong> so.
</p><p>Most commonly, Stupid Crooks are low-level burglars and petty thieves; other times, they may be people who don't have criminal records or have never committed a crime before but are suddenly tempted to commit one for fast cash or some other small reward. No matter what though, these guys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes">always get</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes">something</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlethoraOfMistakes">wrong</a>. They use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper Thin Disguises</a> (that don't work), they rob a store that they visit daily where all the employees would recognize them, they use their real names to communicate with each other, they do all of those things at once and more! Stupidity has no limits, and that has never been truer than in instances involving Stupid Crooks.
</p><p>On most occasions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> with the crook(s) either bungling a job that has low risk and is extremely petty (like taking candy from a baby) or one that comes with greater risk in a criminal field that they have no experience with. Stupid Crooks always get caught by the cops (even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Police Are Useless</a> for anything else) or otherwise end up having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">a price to pay for their idiocy</a>.

<ul><li> The gang are tasked with organising a (rigged) bicycle race, with competitors from twelve countries, on a track on a military base. They discover <em>as the race is about to begin</em> that the track has an enormous gap in it because they couldn't move the motor pool, and the crowd riots when told the race must be postponed indefinitely.
</li><li> After Kid Sally's demotion for the bicycle race fiasco, he and the gang decide to kill Baccala and his right-hand man, Water Buffalo. Their attempts lead to the deaths of <em>four</em> of their own members - two are run over by Water Buffalo when their attempt on his life fails thanks to their refusal to walk through a puddle in their expensive shoes, another is blown up by a stick of remotely activated dynamite that is accidentally set off by a police radio, and another electrocutes himself when he climbs a utility pole and raises a knife to throw at Baccala through his office window.
</li><li> Having acquired a lion in the course of preparing for the bicycle race, the gang decide to use the animal to intimidate an assortment of local shopkeepers for a "protection" racket. At a butcher's, they decide to order ten pounds of steak for the lion. Inevitably, the money and the steak are put in identical bags, and the gang doesn't realise they've thrown the wrong bag into the lion's room until after he's eaten every dollar.
</li><li> When Kid Sally tries to kill Baccala himself as he dines with fake priest Mario Trantino, everything that can go wrong does. The bodyguards wait a ridiculously long time to order the drinks they are planning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">spike</a>, prompting the nervous bartender to order them to down them at gunpoint. The van they are using as cover sits outside the restaurant for so long that they are given a parking ticket. And the bullets for Kid Sally's gun barely fit into the chambers, so that when he charges into the restaurant and aims at Baccala's head, the gun blows up in his hand.

The entire film's plot hinges on the main characters being complete idiots who make mistake after mistake in their gruesome kidnapping and extortion plan.

Naturally, they don't get out of the building before the bomb detonates. (They live though.)

In the commotion, the main character escapes, prompting the kingpin to remark, "Well this is a bloody circus!"
</li><li> The protagonists of <em>Villains</em> are a subversion. While theyÂ’re easily distracted, and seemingly incompetent, the two are actually quite crafty and the only thing keeping them from being truly effective criminals is that theyÂ’re too softhearted.

Unlicensed theft is bad enough in Ankh-Morpork because the Thieves Guild feels very strongly about people who break their rules. Making it worse, he stole from an academy full of wizards, who could easily destroy the world if they weren't distracted by the drama of being at a university. It doesn't help that the UU Librarian is a vengeful orangutan who can use library shelves to travel through time.

Usually, his stupidity and crimes are unrelated to the other, but one occasion stands out where, after previously giving away all of his possessions when he incorrectly assumed he was finally going to the afterlife, he was caught stealing tips left on tables at Der Waffle House, where the gang <em>always</em> meets and hangs out, and is immediately kicked out and barred from coming back to the diner by the group's usual waitress Kiffany.
</li><li> Mason actually has a fairly high success rate with his stupid crimes because of the fact that he is undead. So while a normal stupid crook would end up dead or massively hurt, Mason merely ends up in a lot of pain until his undead body recovers.

A bit of a subversion however, as all of this evidence was discovered after one of the kidnappers had already been tortured by a vigilante into confessing and who was then killed, while the other one was released from police custody by the vigilante while Hank and Nick were busy being shown the evidence, and was then himself killed by the vigilante.
</li><li> Bob Odenkirk plays a kidnapper on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow">Mr. Show</a></em> sketch, who tries sending a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerInTheMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerInTheMail">Finger in the Mail</a> when demanding a ransom... AFTER he sends the parents back their son. And it wasn't the son's toe, it was his own. And the police manage to trace his location during his phone call when demanding the ransom.

</li><li> The Dutch comedy show <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Koefnoen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Koefnoen">Koefnoen</a></em> had a series of sketches titled <em>Poorly Organized Crime</em>. It featured a gang engaged in all manner of criminal enterprises and screwing them up every time. Examples include a diamond heist where they mix up the diamond and the fake they planned to leave in its place, making a ransom demand while having no plan on where and how the ransom should be delivered, or being tasked to steal a modern art piece titled "No title" and realizing there are several paintings without a title and not knowing which to steal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>, one of their members would get killed by accident.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em> has a few.
<ul><li> In one episode, a pair of drug dealers, knowing the narco detectives are close to finding them, try hiding their bags of high-grade heroin in the gas tank. One of the bags ruptures, turning their new automobile into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a> in time for Reed and Malloy to happen by.
</li><li> In another episode, a thief breaks into a synagogue and steals a typewriterâ€”not realizing that it's only designed for typing in Hebrew.
</li><li> There was also a drug dealer who tried to use a laundromat dryer to dry his pot. It wouldn't have worked anyway, even if a cop hadn't come in.
</li><li> At LAX Airport, a thief picked the pocket of a Marine off to a tour of duty at Okinawa, but didn't ask where the Marine was coming or going, and certainly didn't count on him having already changed his money.
<div class="indent"><strong>Malloy</strong>: Last I checked, three hundred dollars in Japanese yen spends pretty tough in Chicago.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Quite a few stupid crooks show up in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, which is a given, considering that at this point, the not-yet-Saul, Jimmy McGill, isn't involved with the major, high-rolling criminals he later handles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jimmy's clients in the series premiere broke into a mortuary, cut the head off a corpse, and then had sex with it. On top of that, they made a video of the whole event. The prosecutor only needs to play the tape as his closing statement to get them sent to jail.
</li><li> The first episodes has two brothers who try to scam motorists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident">by throwing themselves in front of cars and faking injuries</a>. First, they pull it off on Jimmy, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">beat-up Suzuki Esteem</a> leaves so much to be desired that he very obviously doesn't have any money to be scammed of. After being enlisted by Jimmy to stage one of their stunts on a client he's interested in obtaining, but without memorizing the description of the car, they instead end up targeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Tuco Salamanca</a>'s grandmother by accident. After following her, their cultural sensitivity and people-reading skills leave much to be desired. They make the mistake of calling Tuco's grandmother a "bizznatch" in front of Tuco, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">angering him</a>. If it weren't for Jimmy managing to successfully talk Tuco down from killing them to just breaking a leg on each of them, their fates would have been anonymous, shallow graves in the wasteland.
</li><li> The Kettlemans. After embezzling more than $1.6 million in county funds, they stage their own kidnapping and flee into the woods near their home with their children in tow. They clearly had no plan beyond that and things could have gone very tragically if Jimmy had not found them. On top of that, they did an awful job covering up the fact that they embezzled the money with tactics such as writing government checks to themselves to falsely claim it. Jimmy later lampshades this to Mike and tells him that he thought that criminals would be smarter than that.
</li><li> After Nacho gets arrested for supposedly getting involved in the aforementioned "kidnapping", Nacho threatens Jimmy for supposedly ratting on him. Jimmy responds by pointing out all the elementary mistakes Nacho made, like using his own van in staking out the Kettlemans' house, getting spotted by a neighbor (in a clearly-marked Neighborhood Watch zone), and failing to clean the blood (from the skaters) from the back of his van, which gave the cops the probable cause to arrest him and start to dig into his activities. He essentially framed himself for a crime he had not yet committed. As Nacho becomes a recurring character for the rest of the series, he naturally improves his criminal skills.
</li><li> Mike's former client, Daniel Warmolt (a wormy little bald guy who sells pharmaceuticals to drug dealers), invites Nacho inside his car during a meet, which allows Nacho to find his address and later break in and trash his place and take Daniel's stock, drug money, and anything else he fancies. Even dumber, Dan then proceeds to call the police, who easily find where he hides his money and begin a highly inconvenient investigation.
</li></ul></li><li> Buster Brady from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrsBrownsBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrsBrownsBoys">Mrs. Brown's Boys</a></em> is a complete moron who, along with Agnes' son Dermot, spent some time in jail for a prior offence. However, unlike Dermot, he has never learned his lesson and keeps trying to rope Dermot into a get rich quick scheme whenever he can. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's even at it during his legitimate work, such as how he stole a Â€1,000 watch when he was working for Dermot's brother on a New Year's special, causing him to get fired.</span>
</li><li> It's pretty much guaranteed one will show up in any given episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS">COPS</a></em>. Examples include a man who tried to run with his hands cuffed behind his back, a man who called the police because someone stole his marijuana, and a woman who called the police because her neighbor didn't use the money she gave said neighbor to buy her cocaine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em> has Jason Mendoza, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also known as Jianyu.</span> Among other impulsive crimes, at one point he attempted to stage a burglary by hiding in an airtight safe and having his friend, Pillboi, enter a restaurant (unannounced) under the pretense of installing it; moreover, he assumed that a snorkel would allow him to breathe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Needless to say, this is what sent him to the afterlife.</span> Season 3 confirms that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">this is inherited</a>; Jason's father is â€” if anything â€” even more stupid and venal.
</li><li> A fun aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodGirls">Good Girls</a></em> is that, while Annie, Beth, and Ruby are usually intelligent women, they are so out of their league as criminals that it's laughable.
<ul><li> Annie doesn't cover up her distinctive back tattoo when robbing the grocery store where she works, causing the manager to realize who she is.
</li><li> After being encouraged to "borrow" a car from the dealership where Beth's cheating husband works, Annie figures they can have it back and no one will know it's gone... until she realizes the car's computer has a memory of them driving it over the border and back. Annie also messes things up by syncing the car computer to her phone so she can listen to her songs, which could also lead right back to the trio.
</li><li> Ruby threatens a guy with a gun, assuring Beth and Annie that it's not loaded. However, she's forgotten there's a round in the chamber and accidentally shoots the guy in the leg.
</li><li> The girls decide to "outsource" by enlisting some neighbors into a "Secret Shopper" program to help launder the money. This leads to one guy getting $20,000 worth of merchandise stolen in the parking lot. Then, one woman starts taking some of the money for herself to make ends meet. Hearing of this, Rico clearly cannot believe these gals are doing a money-laundering operation <em>within</em> a money-laundering operation.
</li><li> The gals keep committing what Rico says is the big mistake of a crook: As soon as they get a big windfall, they splurge on everything from a new car to expensive clothing and jewels, ignoring how odd it will seem for three once-struggling women to be able to afford all this.
</li><li> Lampshaded when Annie chews Beth out for leaving DNA at a crime scene on being an "amateur mistake," and Beth retorts, "We <em>are</em> amateurs!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>:
<ul><li> A double example occurs in the first episode, in which a pair of junkies attempt to pay for their hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterfeitCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterfeitCash">unconvincingly monochrome-photocopied money</a> â€” which the dealer obliviously accepts. D'Angelo Barksdale is not pleased.
</li><li> In one episode, Major Colvin is going for a late-night cruise around the Western District in uniform and driving an unmarked police car while spotters announce his presence to everyone in earshot. In spite of the warnings, a kid named Justin tries to sell him drugs. Colvin lets out a bewildered "What?" The kid asks again, so Colvin turns up the volume on his police radio. When that doesn't work, he puts on his peaked cap, and the kid finally gets the message and backs off while his friends break out howling in laughter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EscapeAtDannemora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EscapeAtDannemora">Escape at Dannemora</a></em>: Throughout the miniseries, Matt is shown as a bigshot in prison. However, the final two episodes reveal that he's a truly hopeless crook on the outside. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullEpisodeFlashback">Full Episode Flashback</a>, he commits a heinous and thoroughly bungled robbery/murder that ultimately landed him in prison. During his escape, he immediately becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> and holds his co-conspirator back during their flight to Canada. He panics as soon as the pair reach freedom, tries to hide in someone's yard and gets them noticed by the homeowner, ignores the advice to not drink straight from a river, repeatedly gets drunk on stolen booze, and starts firing on passing cars in a pathetic attempt to steal a ride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em>: The season 4 episode "The Bank Robbery" features one who takes Fran and Sylvia as hostages, but otherwise is so unprepared that he forgets to put on a mask and reveals his real name. When he finally makes a run for it, he takes Sylvia with him... and her appetite leads to him having to stop at a restaurant, where he's caught and arrested.

Chumph reasons that someone as rich as Stavros must have some skeletons in his closet. Malvo quickly hijacks his plan. He also inexplicably asks for an incredibly specific amount of money, the exact amount he calculates he'd need to found the business he wants to start.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FargoSeasonThree">Fargo Season Three</a></em>: Ray Stussy's attempt to hire a dumbass criminal to commit a crime against a family member goes about as well as it did for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo">that other down-on-his-luck Minnesotan</a>. And Maurice, the ex-con Ray hires to steal the stamp, really stands out:
<ol><li> Despite being on parole and having to perform a standard urine test, Maurice turns to drugs seemingly without even thinking about trying to trick the test.
</li><li> While getting high and driving to the job, he loses the directions out the window, thus ends up going 75 miles out of the way to Eden <em>Valley</em> instead of Eden <em>Prairie</em>.
</li><li> He assaults the gas station clerk and tears a page out of the phone book so he can get the address (and later tells Ray he "covered his tracks"), which proves that what happens next wasn't random.
</li><li> After getting to the wrong address, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">somehow thinks a man in his late 70s/early 80s is Ray's brother, whom he then kills</span>. Then he brings Ray a set of normal stamps, which is not what he asked for even remotely.
</li><li> He tries to blackmail his parole officer, which would involve turning <em>himself</em> in.

The killer decides that Damian's security is too tight, so he subcontracts out to a local flunky, offering the man $2,000 to commit the deed. The flunky <em>also</em> decides that Damian's security is too tight, so he subcontracts to a third man, a clueless junky who accepts $200 and a baggie of cocaine. The junky kills the wrong man and gets gunned down in the process.
</li><li> A recurring bit on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> are sketches involving some truly idiotic crooks.

Rex looks into the lobby to see the kid honestly believing he can stuff a ten-pound statue under his shirt with no one noticing. The kid is accused of robbing a liquor store with a paper bag "disguise" which he kept lifting up to suck on a helium balloon to "alter" his voice and fled in his own car with a vanity license plate which he had reported stolen from himself. Incredibly, Rex is able to get the kid an acquittal by successfully convincing the jury that there's no way anyone could actually be this stupid.

Most notable is when he kidnaps a Ballas gangster (who's known him since childhood) while wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> (which is seen through immediately) and then calls the Ballas to demand a ransom on his cell phone (which gives his position away to the police). This renders the whole caper moot, as he then has to get rid of the phone and let the victim go. And then in the next mission, Lamar goes to do a drug deal with <em>that same gangster he previously kidnapped</em> (who was, of course, setting up an ambush to kill him).
<ul><li> The player can do this as well. If you hold up a store with an empty gun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets">and pull the trigger</a>, the clerk will hear the clicking, call you a wise guy, and gun you down.
</li><li> On the way to the Paleto Bay heist, the protagonists (and their hired backup) reminisce over their first heists, and it turns out that Michael was the only one of the three who <em>wasn't</em> one of these at some point. Franklin's first job, planned out by Lamar, would have netted them a combined take of $2K, but a dye-packet went off and ruined both stacks. Even worse was Trevor's first job, which went very similar to Ryder's robbery of the Pizza Stack above, except he didn't get away with it and spent six months in jail because of it.
</li><li> The Ballas aren't much better. Posting a photo of their drugs and weapons on social media is how Trevor found out about a juicy target to send the online <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> to rob during the 4th Heist. The photos were <em>geotagged</em>!

<ul><li> One random encounter has you meet a group of bandits along the road dressed in obviously stolen Imperial gear, trying to squeeze "taxes" from you. The stupidity of this (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">the obvious fact</a> that you're practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, of course) is that chances are you're either a Stormcloak or â€” better yet â€” an <em>actual Imperial officer</em>.
<div class="indent">"I am in the legion and I am damn sure you are not!"
</div></li><li> There's also a similar encounter with Thieves. Especially egregious if you are both a member of the Thieves' Guild and wearing the standard-issue armor. You can point out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">this little oversight</a> to them, or even better, if you're the Guildmaster, you can shake <em>them</em> down for having the gall to try and rob their own boss!

Then, they openly and loudly discuss their crimes (both past thefts and the one currently in progress) with Tanimura until he reveals to them that he's a cop, at which point they try to cover up everything they just said with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">a lame excuse</a> and honestly believe that Tanimura is falling for it when he pretends to play along. When they finally realize that he's not buying it, they try to bribe him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper">the contents of a wallet they had stolen previously</a>, but then they remember that they spent most of the money in the wallet already and all they have left is pocket change. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallBribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySmallBribe">try to bribe Tanimura with the change</a> anyway, but by this point, Tanimura is fed up with them and is more or less forced to actually arrest them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their only saving grace is that they're so stupid that they accidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> themselves into wanting to reform themselves and become good citizens.</span>

Homer steals Moe's car and is supposed to leave it on the train tracks, but he gets sidetracked by a showing at a drive-in theater for a movie about a monkey who is president.
