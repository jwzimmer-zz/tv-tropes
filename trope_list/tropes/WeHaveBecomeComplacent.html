</div></div><p>Sometimes directly pointed out by a war veteran or someone with a lot of experience in life, this trope is about some society growing complacent with peace and reluctant to think anything bad can happen.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>
<ul><li> Most of humanity got comfortable after a hundred years of peace and were completely unprepared for the first titan attack. Eren even chewed out Hannes and the Garrison troops for drinking on duty since they thought titans wouldn't be able to breach the wall. Afterwards, the Garrison was somewhat more capable of dealing with titans. The only group that didn't slack off during this period was the Survey Corps and that made them the most experienced and prepared to deal with titans. It's later revealed this lack of technological advances is <em>intentional</em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a> have been assassinating or kidnapping people that develop technology the government considers a threat.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The nation of Marley gets an extremely rude awakening after 4 years of war, having reached the point where modern technology is beginning to render Titans obsolete. After naval artillery blows the Armored Titan to pieces, several military officers discuss the need to begin focusing on development of traditional weapons after nearly a century of neglecting them in favor of using Titans</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: In the Thousand Year Blood War arc, the ancient war between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">Shinigami</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">Quincies</a> flares up again. It's revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly">Uryuu Ishida's</a> arrival in Soul Society two years previously had made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mayuri</a> realise a future Quincy assault would occur - and succeed - but Yamamoto dismissed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">warning</a> as paranoia, so did nothing to prepare for it. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Yhwach</a> and Yamamoto confront each other, Yhwach reinforces Mayuri's accusation, observing that the Shinigami's genocide of the Quincies two centuries previously created peace for the first time - and as a result, they became complacent and soft, making it easy for the Quincies to commit a retaliatory genocide before the Shinigami could muster any kind of meaningful defence. As a result of the Shinigami oversight, the only Shinigami within the Gotei 13 who has any meaningful knowledge of Quincies is Mayuri.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: After defeating L, Light spends the next several years comfortably dispensing his brand of justice without any intellectual opposition, feeding his god complex to the point he becomes reckless and prideful enough to believe he'll never lose. This likely factored into why Near and Mello were able to bring about his downfall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>
<ul><li> Vegeta mocks Cui, Dodoria, and Zarbon for becoming complacent since they had Frieza to protect them, while he became stronger fighting on the front lines. This turns out to be very true for Cui and Dodoria, who were completely outmatched against Vegeta and died screaming for Frieza to help them. Zarbon, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">was a different story and was able to dominate Vegeta in their first fight thanks to his transformation</a>. Even after Vegeta surpasses him, he still puts up a decent fight.
</li><li> All the heroes, except for Vegeta and Goku, becomes this in the Buu Saga. After Cell's defeat, the Earth went seven years of peace without incident. Then Babidi came with his most powerful minion being only as strong as last season's main villain. Still, he was able to effectively kill Piccolo and Krillin and fought Gohan to a draw because he actually got weaker from not training. Vegeta also sold his soul for power, making Goku the only person able to stop him. Things got worse when Buu was awakened, who is <em>many</em> times stronger than any previous villain catching the entire cast, except Goku, flatfooted. They spent most of the saga frantically trying to get strong enough just to challenge Buu.
</li><li> From the Cell Saga onwards, Goku finds himself exasperated with his friends and loved ones for their tendency to do this, especially since they constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">depend on him</a> to save the day when one day, he <em>will</em> die permanently and when that day comes, no one will be able to counter the next big threat to Earth unless they stop being so dependent on him. This leads to him trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">pass the torch</a> to first Gohan, then Goten and Trunks, but sadly, they end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">too lazy</a> to keep training, adding to his annoyance.
</li><li> This trope becomes a recurring problem for Gohan after the Cell Saga, as he lacks the drive to actively train when there's no immediate threat:
<ul><li> By the time of the Buu Saga, he's neglected training for seven years. He struggles against Dabura, a fighter he could easily have defeated had he kept in shape, and is no match for Majin Buu, who beats him so brutally that his loved ones and friends believe him dead. He makes up for it after the Old Kai unlocks all of his hidden power.
</li><li> He falls into it <em>again</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> and its subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> adaptation, where he's slacked off to the extent that he's lost his Ultimate power-up and can barely maintain the basic Super Saiyan state. This bites him in the ass big-time when Frieza nearly kills him with a single punch in the movie, kills Piccolo in the <em>Super</em> adaptation, and blows up the Earth in both versions. Realizing how far he's fallen and that he can't depend on his father forever, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gohan asks Piccolo to retrain him after his revival</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Krillin also hits this in <em>Super</em>. Having retired from fighting after the Cell Saga, he's become so weak that, when working as a police officer, he has difficulty capturing ordinary criminals and ends up being injured by an ordinary bullet. When Android 18 ridicules him for it, stating that the weakling he's become is <em>not</em> the man she fell in love with, Krillin goes along with Goku to retrain himself.
</li><li> Future Trunks also did this in <em>Super</em>. After defeating the Androids, Cell, Babidi, and Dabura, he relaxed and thought that Super Saiyan 2 was the peak of his power. This causes him to be no match for Goku Black when he shows up to wipe out humanity. When he sees how strong Goku and Vegeta have become, Trunks initially plans to relax and let them handle Black, but Vegeta scolds him for this, saying he should <em>always</em> strive to surpass his limits no matter the situation. Trunks takes this to heart and resolves to constantly train.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> Occasionally floated in various series when someone points out that warfare leads to a huge uptick in R&amp;D.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91">Mobile Suit Gundam F91</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>, the Earth Federation has become stagnant. Mobile suits from the Second Neo-Zeon War are still in use and they're not prepared for the new threats post Zeon. By <em>Victory,</em> the civilian forces have more advanced suits than the EFSF.
</li><li> Master Asia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> is disgusted with the Gundam Fight, where nations fight a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">Combat by Champion</a> to determine who rules for four years. He sees it as a worthless game that doesn't even do a good job of replacing warfare because it still takes place on Earth, which is routinely torn to pieces by the fighting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Gym Ghingnham, is motivated by this. He firmly believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans Are Warriors</a> and must fight in order to keep from stagnating, so he tries to reignite the horrific warfare of the Black History.
</li><li> Colonel Cumpa of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG">Gundam: Reconguista in G</a></em> is completely unimpressed with Capital troops holding huge festivals on the weekend, thinking them unprepared and unworthy for potential threats (like all the various spacenoid factions wanting to come back, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for which he is an agent</span>). The anti-technology strictures are also a point of contention among the Earth factions, who are in a tug of war between wanting to advance and avoiding a repeat of the devastating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Races</a> of the past.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens repeatedly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, both in the backstory and the series proper:
<ul><li> At first there was the United Earth Government, born 90 years after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">apocaliptic</a> Thirteen Days War. At first the government worked, rebuilding Earth's infrastructure and ushering a golden age of explorations and colonization, but by the 26th century it was decadent, tyrannical over the colonies and in the hands of a corrupt military (notable the <a class="urllink" href="http://gineipaedia.com/wiki/2527_Military_Expenditure_Hearings">2527 Military Expenditure Hearings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: the wastes of the Space Force had been exposed to everyone, and the budget was <em>increased</em>), and in the 27th century the colonials finally started fighting back and, with their <a class="urllink" href="http://gineipaedia.com/wiki/Black_Fleet">Black Fleet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, shattered the Space Force and the United Earth Government itself;
</li><li> After about a century the fall of the UEG, humanity reunited under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Galactic Federation</a>, whose first two centuries were rightly called the Golden Age of Humanity, after which the Federation people just stopped caring. The government became overly conservative and decadent, crime skyrocketed, and the wiser men started expecting a repeat of the fall of the UEG. It didn't happen. Instead Rudolph von Goldenbaum, an officer of the Galactic Federation Armada, entered politics and managed to get elected as both prime minister (chief executive) and president of the parliament (chief of the legislature), and reformed the Federation into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Galactic Empire</a> with himself as the emperor;
</li><li> While cruel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight">the rule of Rudolph the Great succeeded into bringing back justice and a decent level of life to humanity</a> with the help of capable men he made into the High Nobles. His successors and the newer generations of High Nobles, however, started caring only of becoming richer and pleasuring themselves, suppressing with military strength those who protested and had not escaped to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Free Planets Alliance</a>. By the time the Empire and the Alliance finally meet, the Empire decides to conquer what they consider a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Rebel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Alliance</a>... And at Dagon their fleet is on the receiving end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> from an opponent outnumbered two-to-one and using inferior technology, thus starting the Long War;
</li><li> After Dagon the situation is effectively a stalemate for 28 years, with the Alliance population skyrocketing thanks to refugees from the Empire and their military having expanded after the triumph in the first major battle. Thus when the new emperor Kornelias I offers them a negotiated entry in the Empire they laugh at his emissaries three times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontMakeMeDestroyYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontMakeMeDestroyYou">even when the last group warns them that a refusal to start negotiations would mean facing the full power of a properly prepared Imperial Fleet</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringIt">The Alliance dares the Empire to try</a>, expecting another victory... And instead the Imperial Fleet, that Kornelias had prepared to deal with the Alliance after studying the initial expedition and taking care of learning from the errors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">bulldozes through the Alliance Starfleet</a>, and is only halted when Kornelias receives news of a palace coup and has to turn back and put it down. The trope here is at work for <em>both sides</em>, as the Empire still had to properly transition to war economy and, after the failure of the expedition, doesn't have the means to launch another before the Alliance recovers;
</li><li> Another 28 years later, the Imperial Fleet is confident in their victory and launches another offensive. The Battle of Shandarua is such a devastating defeat that, almost a century later, the Imperial Fleet is <em>still</em> ashamed.
</li><li> About a century after the start of the war, the Alliance is at its peak, and, under the lead of Bruce Ashbey and the fellow members of the Year 730 Mafia, the Free Planets Star Fleet inflicts such a one-sided defeat to the Imperial Fleet they could just march all the way to Odin and impose peace. Sadly, Ashbey died in that battle and without his lead, the Year 730 Mafia disbanded due to infighting, and about 40 years later, when the series proper is set, not only the Empire has rebuilt its military (with a number of competent admirals in command) and placed the unconquerable space fortress of Iserlohn on the only invasion path (with Reinhard von Lohengramm, who has Rudolph the Great's ambition but a more human character, quickly climbing through the ranks to take over and reform the Empire), but most Star Fleet admirals are sadly incompetent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">with some of the few competent officers remaining itching to start a coup and forcibly reform the Alliance</a>) and politicians treating their position as means to make money. At least Star Fleet admirals and the smarter politicians are realizing they're getting screwed;
</li><li> Finally, during the series proper, the politically inconvenient military genius Yang Wen-Li <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit">is sent in the suicide mission of conquering Iserlohn with an understrength fleet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">put together from recruits and the survivors of a recent military disaster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">and succeeds</a> with <em>zero losses</em>.

Society had become so accustomed to heroes always succeeding, specifically All Might, that regular people have no sense of agency or need to help anyone who needs it, always believing that a hero will come and fix the problem for them. When the slightest thing goes wrong, the public freaks out and immediately begins losing trust in the UA staff for something that wasn't fully their fault, simply because they have forgotten that heroes are only human, too. Tomura Shigaraki invokes this when he holds Midoriya hostage for a brief moment, stating that if he wanted, he could kill over 40 to 50 people before a hero finally arrived to stop him, and his ultimate plan is to expose to the people of the world just how flawed their blind belief in the hero system is; that their sense of safety is an illusion, and anytime, anywhere, a villain or disaster could kill you at a moment's notice just because you weren't expecting it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord">Overlord</a></em>, the Re-Estize Kingdom was founded by the Slane Theocracy long ago in the hopes that it would be a place where new heroes of humanity would appear. The Theocracy believed that the strong natural defenses of the kingdom would make it a safe haven for humanity's future heroes to grow. Unfortunately, this very security led to the Kingdom becoming complacent. The Kingdom's nobility squandered their time and effort on petty political power struggles since they believed the Kingdom would never fall. The Kingdom is in such a bad state that the neighboring expansionist Baharuth Empire hasn't even bothered to go all out to conquer it, and instead engages it in annual "wars" intended to gradually sap the Kingdom's strength so that they can effortlessly conquer it later. The Kingdom <em>does</em> have a few strong champions in it — the Adamantite ranked Adventurer teams Blue Rose and Red Drop and Warrior Captain Gazef Stronoff — but even they pale in comparison to the Slane Theocracy's own elite operatives. The Slane Theocracy thus considers the Kingdom a failure.

<ul><li> Temnobog, the Bogolenya Deer god of Evil, is disgusted by societies that become overly Good, since the absence of Evil will cause its inhabitants to forget why they're Good and think that they can do whatever they want because they're Good, unwittingly becoming the very Evil that they defeated in the first place. He even believes that Queen Dazzleglow's attempts to break the Cycle would result in a complacent Equus, except no, she also believes in Constructive Evil and wants people to break the Cycle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so everyone would be able to fight the... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">thing</a></em> that's lurking in the Cosmic Void</span>. On the other hand, Temnobog also opposes societies that have become overly Evil, and will not hesitate to let the Four Terrors, his surviving divine children, raze and burn such societies to the ground as punishment for their extreme Evil.
</li><li> Temnoist followers are also against societies promoting the absence of Evil/Good, as they believe that Good cannot exist in the absence of Evil and vice-versa, and the consequences of such a thing will be worse, than if Good and Evil existed together. So while they are feared and reviled as agents of Evil, Temnoists believe that by promoting Evil, they help good people become strong enough to oppose Evil, thus in turn allowing the Cycle of Good and Evil to continue.

And he's absolutely right.
<div class="indent"><strong>Starswirl</strong>: Celestia and I had a falling out recently, over reasons I have sworn to reveal to no other soul. However, those events taught me something, something that Equestria seems to have failed to realize. Celestia and Luna, as great and powerful as they may be, are still ponies. They laugh, they cry, they hate, and... they love, the same as all of us, and those emotions can impact their decisions. They are great, but they are not perfect, and I fear that one day, Equestria may pay the price for one of their mistakes. <br/>And yet, we have grown too reliant upon the two of them. Before the two alicorns took the throne, the vocation of wizard, or warrior, or scout, was a common one. Great ponies went on adventures into wild and dangerous territory, winning glory and returning with new knowledge and opening new trade routes to other places, and having such reckless and daring heroes helped make Equestria a safer place. Now, however, we have grown complacent: Adventurers are the exception, not the rule. We rely on the princesses to handle everything that this world can throw at us, and they easily throw into Tartarus every monster that might threaten ponykind. This has made us safe, yet it has also made us soft. Progress is slowing to a crawl. In my youth, new spells were invented every year, but my own most recent contribution, a spell concerning the creation of pottery, is the only new enchantment to be created in fifty years, and another is unlikely to appear for a long, long time. Our magic is less a weapon of war or a tool of survival, and more a bauble to entertain children. Our current generation of soldiers is comprised of peacekeepers, not warriors, and have more experience breaking up fights than they do in fighting battles. I say this now, and I say it with certainty: Without the alicorns, Equestria would quickly fall into ruin.

<div class="indent"><strong>Hermione</strong>: While the wizarding world sat on its laurels for dealing with Grindlewald, the muggle one plowed ahead, ever-changing and ever-growing. While the wizarding world saw lamps that conjured gas as the end-all and be-all for lighting, the muggle one invented lights bright enough to turn night into day. And while the wizarding world was content to ride a broom through the air, the muggle one reached for the stars. Muggles don't see limitations, they see challenges. They don't see the impossible, they just see what hasn't been done yet. And right now, they are a sleeping dragon. If you awaken it, we will all die.

Their strategies (which every Turian admiral is expected to memorize and implement at every opportunity) were created centuries before for use against Batarian pirates and peacekeeping missions, not the kind of total war being fought.

Aya Shameimaru, once their greatest warrior and intelligence operative, was exiled and ostracized to the point of becoming a buffoonish pervert from the sheer loneliness for the crime of keeping records of massacres instigated by the tengu. Even the oni, their ancient enemies and overlords, managed to develop the Underground into a functional, cosmopolite city, and fully acknowledge and start making amends for their terrible past, contrasting with the stagnant tengu attempts to keep to themselves and sanitize both their history and their society into perfect stasis.

The police are unprepared when a new supervillain emerges, and the social shift brought about by this complacency makes the people of Gotham easy pickings for Bane's manipulations.

The public saw the Kaiju as means to entertainment, such as making toy lines and television gags. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap">Mass "Oh, Crap!"</a> when people begun to realize that the Kaiju are adapting to fighting Jaegers by targeting the pilots and its power sources.

<ul><li> The fate of the Jedi Council over the course of the prequel trilogy. As it's been a thousand years since the Sith were a visible threat, the Council are convinced they've been wiped out for good. Not only are the Sith very much alive, one of them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge">running the Republic right under their noses.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>, the Jedi Order's surest sign of its blindness to the growing threat of Palpatine's scheme is when Obi-Wan was looking for info on the planet Kamino and there was none to be found. The Head Librarian, Jocasta Nu, is so sure of the archives' comprehensiveness that she automatically dismisses the planet's existence without considering any other possibility of why there is no record. It finally takes one of Yoda's child students to suggest the obvious: that the Archives' records were tampered with to hide Kamino's existence. When the order's Chief Librarian is that stubbornly unwilling to acknowledge such a realistic possibility within the terms of her own calling, it's no wonder that Palpatine is able to crush the Jedi.
</li><li> Yoda comes to this realization himself during his duel with Palpatine in the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>.

Twenty years later, when nearly everybody's become comfortable, an invasion force shows up from the next continent over. After that, things happen just as the trope description says.
</li><li> Society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> had become complacent due to dependence on furycrafting. The power a person possessed determined their place in that society, with the most powerful becoming the High Lords while the least powerful had no place in the citizenry. Naturally the people without strong furycraft would develop strong minds that <em>could</em> enhance society, but because they didn't have strong furycraft they were always ignored. The people with strong furycraft were content with where society was and had no drive to enhance it, which promoted stagnation. Tavi recognized this problem <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and convinced Alera to reassign furycrafting to anyone based on merit, giving strong furycrafting to those with strong minds to use it productively.</span>
<ul><li> It also applied to the army. The Legions had fought and destroyed a number of hostile races over the centuries, but because of all those victories, it was entirely possible that you could go through a tour of duty in the Legions without fighting a single major engagement if you weren't serving on the Shieldwall because the other regions no longer bordered any enemies. This costs them dearly in the initial battles against the Vord.

Over 80% of human space is dominated by the League, with slow outward growth giving new systems entry via the Office of Frontier Security. No fleet battles fought for 300 years, with no real wars fought since the League was founded. They boast ten thousand superdreadnaughts. The Solarian League is the Biggest, Most Powerful Star Nation Man ever saw. But the political mechanisms running the league are ineffective. The politicians have no real power because the founders didn't want a real central government (think something like the US under the Articles of Confederation mixed with the EU and older Polish laws). The Bureaucracy has the real power, but even that is still pretty limited. The power is conserved mainly within families, subverting the democracy and merit requirements for politics. Any member system can veto actions of the elected government, so the Bureaucracy endeavors to make nothing real come up for votes. Because they are big and impossible no one minds this, despite this meaning their Navy is split in two, with the light elements mostly part of Frontier Fleet whose job is to suppress pirates and those who'd rather not join the Solarian League, and the rest in the corrupt Battle Fleet whose positions are on patronage. So bad is it, that sending out <em>any</em> report challenging any assumption the fleet runs on is career death. Of those 10,000 SDs, only 2,000 are in service, 8,000 are mothballed (and some sold off piece by piece) and nearly all are several hundred years old and only periodically updated. A few are made each year mostly as politics and keeping the skills around. In their first real fight, they lose dozens of SDs to light fleet elements due to incompetent commanders and their intended victims having been continuously upgrading their hardware for over twenty years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>.

And when a sword glinted in the hills and he pointed to it, they said it was but the dancing of a brook in the sun.'" <br/>The Cry of Yamar! How long had it been since anyone had quoted that in my hearing? Why should anyone on Beltane?

</li><li> According to the <em>Muqaddimah</em>, a 14th-century Arabic text by historian Ibn Khaldun, this is an important factor in civilizations' decline. The theory is something like this: Early generations of a city have a strong sense of community and an ability to defend themselves because they're not far removed from dwelling outside a city. The later generations become complacent, relying on the city instead of each other, and either don't see a threat coming or can't deal with it. Changes in the rulership of Islamic Spain, in which a decadent dynasty of Umayyads was replaced by a group of religiously zealous desert dwellers from North Africa, were almost certainly an influence on Ibn Khaldun's theory.

In distant past, they have managed to breed out the so-called "wolf gene", which allowed one to kill without remorse. Now, killings are so rare that cops aren't prepared to deal with murderers (who are deranged psychopaths). Anyone who kills is likely to go insane, and nations, no longer able to wage wars, have taken the spy game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Special agents are the only ones trained to kill, and even then extensive psychological therapy is necessary after the fact. Then the world finds out about an isolated enclave of unmodified "wolves". The wolves reveal that they were abducted by an alien empire prior to the Bio-Correction (the removal of the wolf gene) to be used as mercenaries in interstellar wars and have returned after the end of their tour of duty to find a world of pussies, totally unprepared if Earth happens to become the target of an alien race.

The Council of Ottavar took so much faith in the ability of the Emperor's crown to detect dark magic that they never bothered devising any alternative methods to do so. Unfortunately, over time, the Emperors decided that the side effects of using that particular crown (mind-reading) meant that it should only be used on certain ceremonial occasions. When the dark wizards figured this out, they were able to gather and plan so long as they closed up shop shortly before said ceremonial occasions. This allowed them to grow strong enough that they were eventually able to steal the crown, at which point they could operate freely.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki">Inoki</a> Genome Federation, which became the largest MMA promotion in Japan, continued to happily showcase pro wrestling matches in between MMA bouts.
</li><li> The general consensus is that <em>this</em> is the main problem with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>. With the closure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, they've had a monopoly on mainstream wrestling in the US, their only viable competition being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">struggling promotion in Florida that's currently on the verge of going out of business</a>, and a string of indy shows that have neither their resources nor even a fraction of their name recognition, along with control over the most famous and popular talent in North America. This put them under the impression that they can do whatever the hell they want since casual wrestling fans have nowhere else to go, hardcore fans will stick by no matter how bad it is and smarks will stick around to mock and ridicule them for it. In recent years, however, this mentality has caused problems, most notably a steady decline in ratings after RAW went three hours, over-exposing fans to the mediocre writing they've been churning out for years, along with putting the same guys over and over again, turning off many people from watching. WWE seems to have noticed this problem and started relying on part-time performers. While that worked for a little while, it fostered a growing resentment among fans on how many of their favorite stars who they want to get over losing TV time to make way for these part-timers. It all came to a head at the 2014 Royal Rumble, where a returning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>, ring rust and all, won the whole thing while fan favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a> wasn't even in the damn match, consequently getting Dave booed out of the building. Coupled with the fact that the only guy the fans would've accepted as an acceptable substitute for winning it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, lost thanks to someone who was already eliminated and then legit quit the company the day afterwards, and you had the fans borderline rioting to put Bryan in the main event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> that year. The trend has continued several times since then, with the decline reaching new lows not seen since 1997 (when RAW was getting trounced by Nitro), putting the WWE into panic mode.

<ul><li> In the Bible, this happens to Israel over and over again. At first they would strictly adhere to God's instructions and laws but over time would fall more and more into decadence and idol worship so God would send one of the neighboring empires to defeat Israel and take them into slavery. The Israelites would then turn back to God, beg forgiveness, and ask for his help and so God would deliver them from their troubles. They'd then adhere to God's laws but would go back to idol worshiping and so God would send another empire to deal with them and...you get the picture. It happens so often that one entire book of the Bible, Judges, is nothing but stories of this.

It's plainly shown that Citadel Space's economy is <em>ridiculously</em> powerful, and could make a mighty war armada and pull off unprecedented weaponized research if it was turned towards that purpose.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yf2v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yf2v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yf2v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that relatively tiny factions like the single-billionaire Andromeda Initiative (built a 2.2+ billion ton ship and four 17-million ton ones in nine years), the fringe terrorist group Cerberus (built several dozen heavy cruisers, many space stations, and at least one dreadnought in a few years), the new corporation Sonax Industries (invaded Garvug with what's explicitly described as "a large fleet"), the dirt poor quarians (gathered 50,000 armed ships at a rate of about 174 per year, with the economic base of basically a single city), and pre-First Contact humanity (built hundreds of warships including multiple carriers/dreadnoughts and several multi-kilometer space stations in just five years) all managing to build large fleets in short periods of time. Now remember that all of these groups combined shouldn't even have a single percent of Citadel Space's economic and industrial power, with the elcor alone noted as slightly superior to the much more powerful <em>current</em> incarnation of humanity, and Citadel Space as a whole having a population in the trillions at a very high level of GDP per capita. The Council races should be able to build a combined fleet in the hundreds of thousands, easy, given some time to ramp up to total war production, rather than individually being restricted to mere thousands of warships each.</span> But as it has been 1,500 years since the last galactic war (every conflict since then being minor stuff like counter-insurgency, pirate suppression, or squashing the occasional rogue state), Citadel Space is borderline demilitarized compared to how strong it could be.

</li><li> The Dynastic Cycle is a concept ingrained in the Chinese conception of their own history, going back over three thousand years. After an empire rises to power, it has the Mandate of Heaven and prosperity until it declines due to corruption and natural disasters. Then the cycle repeats as the dynasty falls into rebellion or outside warlords seize control, with a unified state rising again as the cycle repeats itself.

For the first time, Ireland was no longer considered a Third World country, and, in fact, had skyrocketed to becoming one of the world's wealthiest countries. However, in spite of the warnings of economists across the country, the bubble burst <strong>hard</strong> as it emerged that corruption was rife through both the banking institutions and property developers in the duration of the boom, causing Ireland to fall billions of Euro in its national debt (which, although coinciding with the then-emerging global economic crisis, was nonetheless a separate issue entirely). Lower-level workers in both the private and public sectors, having grown accustomed to their new, more affluent lifestyles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cryo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4cryo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cryo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">many of which being also in possession of property outside their own homes, on the advice of the government that they would sell well later, only to be left with near-worthless land now</span>, were now facing mass pay cuts across the boards, while the toxic banks were being bailed out with money that would never be seen again (and, judging by the reluctance of the higher-ups to change their ways, to little effect). In short, the people (and, to a more worrying extent, the government) had grown reckless and careless with money, over-relying on credit for payments and making foolish purchases, only for it all to bite them later in the face of the current recession/depression.

</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">Six Day War</a>, Israelis and Israeli leadership thought the Arab nations around it would be wise enough not to pick a fight with Israel again for a long, long time after they had their ass handed to them.
