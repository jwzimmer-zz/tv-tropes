</div></div><p>A Military Maverick is one of those service members who often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">breaks the rules</a>, and regularly annoys superiors: but he/she generally prevails in the end, just because they broke the rules in the first place.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ut0y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ut0y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ut0y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Breaking the rules in this context doesnt have to be an outright violation, but could also include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">imaginative interpretations of the rules</a>, serving as the justification of such actions.</span>

</p><p>The popularity of this trope is largely because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. For in real life, any military needs people they can be certain will <em>stop</em> fighting when ordered, just as much as they need people who will <em>start</em> fighting when ordered. The primary purpose of order and discipline in the military, apart from doing what you're told, is to learn self-restraint, after all.
</p><p>Still, most instances of this would have far more consequences in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> than in fiction (and so does everything). Note that the higher up you are in the chain of command, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismTropes">the more likely you are to get away with stuff</a>. There are no recruits and privates who can get away with acting like a Military Maverick in fiction does. Or at least, if there are right now, give it a few days. You might get away with disobeying orders and regulations on rare occasions or under unusual circumstances, but doing so to the point of recklessness is a good way to end a military career with a plain and simple dismissal at best or capital punishment at worst. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">So it goes without saying...</a>

Some officers in regular militaries really do rise to the top without ever picking up the "regular" part. However, these folks are much more common and tolerated in non-professional insurgent armies, guerrillas, and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">civil wars</a>, where the entire society goes bananas.
</p><p>If they're still competent military professionals, despite regarding following orders and regulations as optional, they might also be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a>, and sometimes even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>.

</li><li> Elizabeth Beurling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> fame is a maverick herself, taking little heed to the brass and disobeying them at almost every turn (from simple things like smoking and going to the pub late at night to more complex things like refusing to use the new striker units), she is rather skilled in combat and has no ranged weapons instead just uses her kukri and cuts up enemy soldiers, grant she does have a rather gloomy personality to her. The girl has got issues but she can hardly care less. Not surprising given she was at least somewhat based on the real-life maverick George Beurling. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> below for more details.

"Your ego is writing checks your body can't cash." — "You don't have time to think up there. If you think, you're dead."

While the contrast with the politicians and other American leaders has always been there since the first, in <em>Battle Born</em> and beyond it's even more apparent with the more lawful newcomers to Dreamland serving as foils to the old-timers.

<ul><li> Wedge Antilles is a major maverick. He's led Rogue Squadron into defecting (temporarily) from the New Republic itself.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1t2vv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1t2vv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1t2vv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Despite his extremely public resignation, one of his superiors "forgot" to file the paperwork...along with covertly providing Wedge with the equipment he needed...and thus <em>retroactively</em> made his actions an officially sanctioned mission.</span> He was ready to leave again during <em>Starfighters of Adumar</em> when faced with the choice of doing what was ordered or what was right. But he and the Rogues are the best of the best, delivering the impossible, and they do get called on their behavior. Wedge created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Wraith Squadron</a>, an entire squadron of misfits specifically organized for unconventional warfare after seeing how the fleet had become hamstrung by being forced into the role of legitimate government (see the Space section)—and, though not even thirty, found himself feeling like a tired old man when confronted with their antics and tactics.
<div class="indent"><strong>Wedge:</strong> Wes, they're doing it to me again.
</div></li><li> With respect to Wedge, at least, it's made clear again and again that he's one of the smartest men in the service, and that when he bucks the system, it's often because he really does know better than his superiors.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jagged Fel:</strong> If I may ask, how old were you when you first disagreed with your commanding officer, and later found out you were right? <br/><strong>Wedge:</strong> Twenty. Which is when I first had a commanding officer.
</div></li><li> The Rogues tended to be pilots with secondary commando skills whose missions meant those skills became important very, very often; the Wraiths were picked as commandos who could pilot snubfighters. The Wraiths were eventually transferred out of the military's Starfighter Command to New Republic Intelligence.
</li><li> It's noted in the Wraith Squadron books (after one of the pilots essentially has a nervous breakdown in flight and nearly kills another pilot) that because of the war and the Rebellion/New Republic's need for pilots, it's possible to survive incidents that would absolutely get you canned in less troubled times. Since the Star Wars galaxy is pretty much in a permanent state of crisis, military mavericks thrive in it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em>, Jaina Solo, leader of Twin Suns Squadron, disobeys orders to save one of her pilots. General Antilles wants to reprimand her, but his nephew - the pilot Jaina saved - talks him down. It's not that hard. Wedge is asked when was the first time <em>he</em> disobeyed an order for similar reasons, and says it was when he was twenty, the first time he had a superior officer.
<ul><li> Jaina was encouraged to <em>act</em> like a Military Maverick, outside of (actually <em>above</em>) the chain of command, as part of a convoluted psychological warfare ploy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">impersonate a goddess</a>. In reality, she was carrying out orders given to her in secret by General Antilles and his staff (except for the above incident), but most of her allies not in the know thought it was a sterling example of nepotism gone horribly wrong.

It resulted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a couple cases of treason and eventually being banished to Australia. Of course, if Temeraire wasn't such a maverick Laurence would probably be dead.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekRobinson">Derek Robinson</a>'s character of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CH3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CH3">CH 3</a>, in <em>A Piece of Cake</em>. An American pilot and soldier of fortune who for political reasons is posted to Hornet Squadron in time for the Battle of Britain, he becomes unpopular not just for having more combat experience than all the British pilots put together, he is highly critical of the British command a tactical philosophy. It doesn't help that experience proves him right, although not before several pilots are killed in action.
</li><li> The foul-mouthed Guinness-drinking cynic and anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles">Biggles</a> Major Wooley, in <em>Goshawk Squadron</em>. A working-class Brummie who made it into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1">WW1</a> officer corps, his superiors would dearly like to sack or demote him, but as he is an accredited Ace, they dare not.
</li><li> Mackenzie "Mac" Calhoun, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">Star Trek: New Frontier</a></em>, was specifically picked to command the <em>Excalibur</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger">only ship in the sector</a> because he was basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> of Starfleet.

<ul><li> It's made obvious at the start of the series that the only reason she was able to get away with all the crap she pulls is that she's just <em>that damn good</em> and the <em>Galactica</em> herself was under the command of an officer who was going to be retired soon. Later, she was one of a few dozen fighter pilots left in the whole of humanity in a little fleet almost completely dependent on pilots for defense. There was a good chance she'd get discharged in normal times, but when you're down to 40...
</li><li> Later a major reason for the favoritism shown by Adama (and a lot of the recklessness shown by Kara) is explained by revelations concerning her engagement to Adama's dead son.
</li><li> Subverted with Pegasus Commander Barry Garner, who once made the typical Maverick "Screw the orders, I'm saving my men" decision, complete with his crew backing him against the outsider observer (aka Lee Adama) - only to notice that <em>yes</em>, it <em>was</em> a trap, it very nearly cost the human race its most powerful battleship and it gained them nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> Harmon Rabb, Jr. from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, the Naval Aviator who became a lawyer.
</li><li> Colonel Jack O'Neill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. He manages to get away with it because his judgement in the field usually turns out to be correct in the long run, and the number of times he's saved the planet tends to give him some job security - plus, there's the fact that he can technically retire whenever he feels like it, having come out of retirement in the first place to lead SG1. Humorously, when real-life Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan guest-starred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Himself</a> on the show, Richard Dean Anderson, who played O'Neill, asked him if he had any officers as insubordinate as O'Neill. The response, apparently, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">"Son, we've got colonels like you, and worse."</a>
</li><li> John Sheppard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> and suffers far more consequences for it than O'Neill. His military background was built on this as in Afghanistan he disobeyed direct orders and took his helicopter to rescue his friends. Not only did he fail to save them, but he was court-martialed, nearly kicked out of the Air Force (in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> he was) but was relegated to taxi duty instead.
<ul><li> In the show itself the only reason he was even allowed to accompany the Atlantis mission is because of luck, skill, and the support of more alternative thinking higher-ups Elizabeth Weir and General O'Neill. He impressed O'Neill by performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedMissileDodge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedMissileDodge">High-Speed Missile Dodge</a> with a non-combat helicopter to escape an alien drone and then got Weir's attention by discovering he had the Ancient gene and could command their technology seemingly without effort. As Weir was a civilian diplomat rather than military commander, his rebellious streak didn't put her off (especially as it was motivated by personal loyalty) and she persuaded his superiors to let him onto her expedition since establishing a base in an entirely different galaxy required out-of-the-box thinking type people. Still, the mission's military commander Colonel Sumner, a far stricter by-the-book officer, didn't like Sheppard for his past and made it clear he wasn't welcome. Later after Sumner was killed Sheppard became Weir's second in command so Sheppard's superiors tried to replace him. Luckily Weir stepped in to defend him and he was safe with her support, but it was still obvious many of the other military commanders disliked him.

At times, the protagonist, Christopher "Maverick" Blair, has as well. Some say he's a subversion. Ironically, he got his callsign because in his Academy Days where, unlike most other hotshot cadets there, he was actually the most by-the-book cadet, and thus a "Maverick" when compared to others.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Real Life</span>
</p><ul><li> It's disputed how true this is, but many of the Polish pilots in the Battle of Britain. Prone to recklessness and spamming the radio with discussions in Polish on the parentage of their German opponents (who they, for obvious reasons, loathed), they were responsible for 12% of the Luftwaffe kills in that battle, despite being only 5% of the pilots. The RAF handbook was often ignored even by British pilots. For example, the rules stated that machine guns' should be zeroed (that is, the bullets would cross the path of the guns from the other wing) at 600m to allow newbie pilots to attack from a safe distance. But to be most effective, it needed to be at 200m, so many pilots from different nations changed them.
</li><li> A documented real-life <em>subversion</em> (not merely aversion) was going on with test pilots, at least back in the early '70s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> wrote an article depicting the Air Force's test pilots as almost frighteningly sane, rational, by-the-book, methodical fliers who were as much scientist as warrior — which makes some sense, given their vocation. Hence the old saying: what's the difference between God and an Air Force pilot? God doesn't think he's a pilot.
</li><li> A documented real-life <em>deconstruction</em> is Colonel Arthur "Bud" Holland, the pilot of the B-52 that crashed at Fairchild Air Force Base in 1994, who had a reputation for aggressive flying and violating safety regulations. How aggressive? During a training mission at the Yakima Bombing Range, Holland purposefully flew his aircraft well below the recommended altitude of 500 feet and cleared a ridgeline by only <em><strong>three feet</strong></em>, causing his co-pilot to grab at the controls and forcing a photography crew documenting the flight to duck for cover. One of Holland's superiors was later court-martialed for <em>failing to take action</em> over his behaviour. That's like being so high your <em>friend</em> hallucinates.
</li><li> John McCain, who was more than happy to point this out. This dated back all the way to his time at the Naval Academy, where he graduated 5th from the bottom of his class due to just barely studying enough to pass in classes that he wasn't interested in and achieving membership in the "Century Club" of cadets who received over 100 demerits. After graduating, he became a bomber pilot and was known for being an extremely reckless flier, crashing several times and once colliding with power lines when he flew too low. It's likely that he got away with more than most junior officers could have because his father and grandfather were both admirals.

He was bad-tempered and contemptuous of authority; when he took off on his last flight, the one that earned him a posthumous Medal of Honor, there were orders out to arrest him for being AWOL. His favorite targets were German observation balloons, which most pilots avoided because they were "invariably ringed with antiaircraft guns and often protected by a flight of fighters. Going after one was much like kicking a hornet's nest, but it was just the sort of challenge Luke liked...." Eddie Rickenbacker called Luke "the greatest fighter pilot of the entire war."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel John Boyd</a> was one of these. He contributed arguably more to the Air Force than anyone before or since (his Energy-Maneuverability theory revolutionized air-to-air combat doctrine and he literally wrote the book on flying a fighter, and he's credited as the father of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane">F-15 and F-16</a> fighters), but had to step on a <em>lot</em> of toes to do so — and took <em>pride</em> in it. In fact, he practically <em>forced the F-16 down the Air Force's throat</em> because they didn't want it — they thought it would take too much money away from the F-15 and their pet bomber of the month. Hell, one time he got a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">major general</a></em> fired for scripting a session with a congressman to attack the F-16. It wasn't uncommon for generals to leave one of his briefings muttering, "That fucking Boyd."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobinOlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobinOlds">Colonel Robin Olds</a>, a World War II vet who fought in Vietnam, his unconventional leadership style an tactics got results but infuriated his leadership. Despite this, he had a very low tolerance for people or organizations who could not meet standards and perform their jobs. Being a Military Maverick didn't mean you stopped being <em>military</em>, after all.
</li><li> Although he was rather a different kind of Maverick, George Beurling counts. After failing to join the Canadian Air Force, and the Finnish air force, he hopped on a ship and went to England to try and enlist in the RAF in which he was successful. He was regarded as high strung, brash, and outspoken, and he also never smoked or drank (which when you're a fighter pilot makes you a maverick...). He was a skilled pilot but rejected a commission at first and was reprimanded for attacking targets without permissions several times. He was also known as a loner in the air and was written up for stunting as well. He was eventually discharged even before the war ended more or less for being a pain in the ass.

On the one hand, his... stretching of orders is widely held to have won the 1973 war against Egypt, but his habit of leaving superiors in the dark and going far beyond his mandate as Minister of Defense played a large part in the fiasco of the Israeli involvement in the Lebanese Civil War in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>.

</li><li> An ancient example: Though it's hard for Alexander the Great to disobey orders, seeing as he's the one giving them, he had an easy enough time disobeying the entire conventions of warfare of the time. He would deliberately ask his older generals for advice, knowing that they would give him conservative answers, and then did the opposite, making him completely unpredictable to his enemies on the battlefield.
<ul><li> The Romans also encouraged initiative among their individual legion commanders. Cynoscephalae, the last decisive battle for Roman control of the Mediterranean, was won largely due to an unknown Roman commander leading a charge to the unprotected Macedonian rear without being ordered to.

The result was the 1930s in Japan were filled with assassinations, attempted coups and the aggressive expansionism that led the country to Pearl Harbor, while from 1941 onward Japan's already hopeless war effort was hobbled still further by officers who would attack without orders and end up getting their men slaughtered.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em> features Lt. Miles Naismith (Lord) Vorkosigan, Barrayaran Imperial Security. He is assigned directly to Simon Illyan, the head of ImpSec, because while he succeeds in absurd situations, he repeatedly drives his commanding officers nuts.
<div class="indent">"Hm," Illyan said. "And yet... who shall I assign you to now? Which loyal officer gets his career destroyed next?" <br/>Miles thought this over. "Why don't you assign me directly to yourself, sir?" <br/>"Thanks," said Illyan dryly.
</div><ul><li> It helps that Illyan knows Miles literally <em>since birth</em>, being his father's long-term aide and then principal political ally.
</li><li> Miles' operating philosophy can be best summed up by this quote, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrothersInArms">Brothers in Arms</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Miles:</strong> No, no, never send interim reports. Only final ones. Interim reports tend to elicit orders. Which you must then either obey or spend valuable time and energy evading, which you could be using to solve the problem.
</div></li><li> He also counts on the "seniority lets you get away with more" front; when he is first admitted to the Imperial Service Academy, his father admits that "I think he will make a terrible ensign... but he might make a fine Chief of Staff one day." Miles is such an insubordinate ensign that Illyan <em>has</em> to either dismiss him or shorten his chain of command so he has fewer people to disobey.
</li><li> Miles makes a career out of creatively interpreting orders and using a heavy dose of artistic license when writing his reports, much to the chagrin of his superiors. Keeping with the tradition of this trope, he never outright lies to a commanding officer and always carries out his orders, in spirit if not in letter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when he does lie, it gets him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">permanently kicked out of the service</a></span>.

They don't become notably more by-the-book; indeed, they tend to become vastly quirkier although, in a twist, it's their <em>commander</em>, Garik "Face" Loran, who picks up most of the weirdness. His approach to operational security is to never tell any of his subordinates <em>anything</em> that isn't immediately relevant to their mission, and Wraith operations carried out under his sanction include "persuade an Imperial admiral that a bomb is actually a very valuable sculpture" and "infiltrate the Imperial bunker using a fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion">Gamorrean janitor</a>". But his crowning achievement is the plot of <em>Mercy Kill</em>, wherein he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suspects that his superior is actually part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> to bring back the Empire</span> and so creates <em>two</em> teams of Wraiths, not telling each about the other and not telling his superiors about <em>either</em>.

He is a fairly strange case since he claims that this case of him disobeying the rules was necessary in order to ensure that orders are always followed, and also because he is high-ranking enough and/or simply stationed on a place remote enough (on Cuba) that his violations of the laws of the military never got him into trouble prior to the film.

It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">wasn't a reward</a>.

</li><li> In a rare example of someone at the top flouting convention, though actually very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">cultured and refined</a> in a way most Imperial fleet officers only hope to be, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> spits in the face of conventional strategic and tactical wisdom. He is confident to the point where he bases entire planetary assaults around esoteric uses of obscure or rare technology and other <em>extremely</em> unusual ideas—ideas that are so odd that he and the captain of his flagship once had a barely-civilized argument over his use of a particular tactic. That particular tactic was in fact outright reasonable (and became <em>routine</em>) compared to some of his more inventive concepts. Then again, Thrawn is only one step down in the chain of command from the Emperor: so long as he remains loyal to the Empire and continues to succeed in his assigned objectives, he has the authority to do whatever he damn well feels like. Thrawn was a military maverick among his own people, too. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Outbound Flight</a></em>, he was the one making preemptive strikes, to the consternation of, well, just about everyone. He actually got exiled for that.
<ul><li> Similarly, General Garm Bel Iblis is a <em>slightly</em> more conventional commander, but despite his cunning and ability to make do with less is often politically ostracized. He even resisted an upgrade to his aging flagship's comm center so that secure messages would remain more secure. This has more to do with his time as an independent rebel, as opposed to capital-R Rebel, than his behavior, but he seems quite content to let matters remain as they are.
</li><li> Thrawn's old student and second-in-command <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Pellaeon</a>, having picked up a bit of that genius and becoming Supreme Commander in time, also manages to utterly frustrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian">his poor captain</a> with tactics that seem counterintuitive at best and stupid at worst.
</li><li> A sort-of inversion comes in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> where the Rebel Alliance fleet, now the legitimate military arm of the New Republic, has to adopt the tactics they once so desperately yet handily worked around. Some try to make the change, but find themselves psychologically hamstrung by being unable to convert to the necessary way of thinking; others take to their new roles with gusto, but forget how to anticipate unconventional tactics. (Operation Emperor's Hammer resulted when New Republic officers took to the <em>Empire</em>'s tactics very, very well.)
<ul><li> Emperor's Hammer, for those who never read the book, was employed against the Yuzhaan Vong, an alien race that only briefly skirmished with the Empire. Therefore they were not aware that one of the primary uses of a Star Destroyer was orbital bombardment...and with something like sixty times the guns, a Super Star Destroyer is even better at it. Wedge Antilles made the Vong think he was desperately retreating, thus luring a very large ground force into the killzone, and then opened fire.
</li></ul></li><li> Vader is definitely a maverick within the Empire's military (proper court-martial? what's that?), but he's <em>Vader</em> and more or less an extension of the actual Emperor. His lieutenants can't complain (literally). Then again, he and not the Emperor held the rank of Supreme Commander of the Imperial Forces...
<ul><li> He was a maverick even before he fell to the Dark Side. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">the Clone Wars</a>, Anakin was known for disregarding protocol and orders from higher authorities - whether it be from the Jedi Council or the Supreme Chancellor - and still ending up with successful results.

<div class="indent"><strong>Han:</strong> With my history, I'd be the laughingstock of the New Republic if I ever brought one of <em>my</em> officers up on charges of insubordination. <br/><strong>Wedge:</strong> Yes, sir, I was sort of counting on that.

Notable is the incident in <em>Rebel Dream</em> where the new (self-proclaimed) Chief of State orders Wedge to commit his forces to a suicidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> at Borelias. Wedge, believing (not wrongly) that the chief's ascension is itself extra-legal, begins <em>dictating terms</em> and implicitly threatens the head of his own government to get the resources he needs to pull the mission off.

However, with her actions in the course of the book included <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">discharging her weapon in a library, disobeying direct orders, postponing the arrest of a psyker to go find a deacon and killing that deacon</span>, so it's a miracle she wasn't executed on the spot, this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">40k</a> and all.

</li><li> Most of the captains from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> seem to fit this mold.

This would have some meaning if the Prime Directive wasn't redefined nearly every episode. Often, the Federation seems to survive more on supreme acts of heroism than any actual organised strategy.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: Special Forces units <em>do</em> tend to be laxer on the rules. Partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">as elite units their superiors let them get by with more</a>—which is as much because special forces tend to recruit soldiers who are self-disciplined and don't need micro-managing, yet are capable of using their initiative, as out of respect for their capabilities—and partly because they're often assigned covert missions where traditional military behavior can be detrimental.
<ul><li> Mark Bowden's book <em>Black Hawk Down</em> goes into detail about how this could cause friction with more conventional units. The Army Rangers at Mogadishu in 1993 practically idolized the Delta unit (reputed for extraordinary autonomy and flexibility) as the top rung of the special forces ladder, but company commander Captain Steele was concerned that Delta's "cowboy" ways would rub off too much onto the younger Rangers (not to mention that he thought that "they could be comically arrogant") who needed discipline, while a Delta sergeant first class had an even lower opinion of the Rangers' basic competence, and of Steele in particular. The movie would allude to the tensions with the "this is <em>my</em> safety sir" scene and then the Delta SFC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> arguing with Captain Steele on the battlefield nearby other Rangers. (The movie version left out that the real Delta who inspired the "safety" scene defied Captain Steele <em>in full view of other Rangers</em>, without the immediate urgency of combat as an excuse.)
<ul><li> According to the book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">it was worse than that</a>; both Captain Steele and the Delta SFC generalized the Rangers as having been young and inexperienced and seemed to see the Rangers as not adopting the deeper understandings or self-discipline. Egregious examples would include Rangers unknowingly firing on Delta positions at least twice without checking first, and a trio of Rangers attempting to imitate <em>how</em> he was taking cover, apparently not understanding that he was doing so <em>only because</em> he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunKata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunKata">found a spot where the cover let him fire with impunity</a>. Unfortunately, one of those Rangers would be mortally wounded while in this position due to being exposed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There is a story about a regulation for "Green Berets" (United States Army Special Forces) in Afghanistan to wear regular uniforms and to shave after a photo came out of a topless Green Beret in a <em>keffiyah</em> on the scene at an averted assassination attempt. Not only would it make them more visible, but the shaving cost them street cred in a country full of traditionalist Muslims...so when one of the brass ordered a team to regularly send photos of themselves with their (changing) radio frequency to show compliance, the team simply kept sending back the first and only clean-shaven photo, with their latest frequency <em>Photoshopped</em> in.

</li><li> The Space Wolves themselves have their own take on the problem, due in part to their method of recruitment (a Wolf Priest selects a badly-wounded warrior from one of Fenris' many clan wars, and the recruit is made aware that he has been chosen to make war on the Emperor's enemies for all eternity). Where other chapters only use veteran Marines in melee assault teams, Space Wolves give their newest members a sword and a boltgun and point them in the enemy's direction, viewing it both as good training and an opportunity to remove the weak and unlucky. The survivors can then move on to become Grey Hunters and Long Fangs (Tactical and Devastator Marine equivalents), while those whose enthusiasm for melee combat never abates can get a bike or jetpack to continue on their chosen path.
