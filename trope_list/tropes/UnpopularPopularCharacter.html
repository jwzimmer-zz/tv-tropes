</div></div><p>A character who is liked in the fandom that, within the work, is the exact opposite: being treated badly, overlooked, or just plain hated by all other characters. In some comedic works, this can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> on the part of the creators, in which the character in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">isn't actually annoying or doesn't actually display the traits</a> they're ridiculed or hated for. It's just funny to have everyone constantly mock and belittle them. Of course, not every character in this category will necessarily be a lovable loser. Sometimes its a case of the audience latching on to the work's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, villain or anti-hero: dangerous characters whom the cast have a legitimate reason to hate and fear, but are sufficiently powerful enough or have enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> that everybody else has little choice but to put up with them.

On the other hand, some shows have such a large fandom that it's difficult to find common ground about who likes/dislikes any one character. Often it comes from the very large difference between what makes a character likable to impartial observers of a situation, and what makes him likable to the people he's interacting with. To be blunt, being a jerk is a horrible way to make friends, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">seems to do wonders for fans</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TrixRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TrixRabbit">Trix Rabbit</a>. Who doesn't want him to get that cereal, kids watching the commercials included?
<ul><li> The company has, at least once, run polls to see if he should get the cereal. When they do, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">the answer is inevitably "yes" in a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">landslide</a></em>. (Indeed, if the message the commercials is trying to get across is the benefits of being selfish and mean to someone, as they suggest, it hasn't rubbed off well.) And at least once, the rabbit has gotten his wish with no strings. (Oddly enough, that one time, where he won it in a bicycle race, the kids in-story had no say in the matter; the contest judges who gave it to him were adults.)
</li><li> One interesting example had him disguised as a human and hurriedly buying Trix (along with other cereals as decoys) before hurrying back to the house and pouring a bowl... before discovering he was out of milk (the entire thing being an admittingly clever Got Milk? ad).
</li><li> One time, the Trix rabbit was moping in front of a little girls' house, when she said she would be willing to give the rabbit Trix. The rabbit actually was able to eat a spoonful before the girl's big brother woke up and took it away. Oddly, this had two versions. Originally, the girl is whispering the whole time, and the brother discovered them. For whatever reason, it was re-shot with the girl yelling "Be very quiet! We don't want to wake my big brother!", as if she's warning her brother to get in there before the rabbit eats too much.
</li><li> The Trix Rabbit often loses things he gains legitimately when the kids take away his Trix as well, such as one where he entered an ice-skating competition and wowed the judges—when the kids took away his Trix, they took away his trophy too. (There was no indication he was not qualified to enter.)

This only changed when he met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">the Band of the Hawk</a> who apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Casca</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Corkus</a> accepted him with open arms. This also served as a metaphorical and physical gut punch as they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">savagely taken away from him</a> in the bloodiest and cruelest way possible. Which sent Guts off alone again as the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Black Swordsman</a></em>.
<ul><li> Naturally Guts's eternal pain and struggle, make the heart and soul of the series in the eyes of fans. Who detest the injustice of Guts being accused and hunted during his quest for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold">righteous vengeance</a> and especially against the alleged hero of the kingdom Griffith who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">worshipped</a> despite the colossal amount of shit he's pulled.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Katsuki Bakugo is the biggest example. Among Class 1-A, the only ones to show signs of liking him are Kirishima, Uraraka, and Midoriya (and of those, Ochaco basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">likes everybody</a> and Deku is his childhood friend), outside of that, he is either the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>, but he has ranked 1st place in two popularity polls in a row.
</li><li> The League of Villains is hated by everyone and even by other villains who consider them childish, such as Stain, and a bunch of overhyped villains, such as Chisaki. They even dislike each other among themselves. Still, characters such as Shigaraki, Himiko, and Dabi maintain a strong fanbase.
</li><li> Hitoshi Shinso isn't exactly popular when he's first introduced because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">Mind Manipulation</a> Quirk which causes people to mistrust him and repeatedly comment it would be a useful power for a villain, and he provokes Midoriya into responding to his question by insulting Ojiro - but then we see that he actually wanted to be in the Hero Course and strives to be one despite the discrimination he faces. The fandom <em>loves</em> Shinso, to the point where he's consistently ranked in the top ten of every popularity poll since he's appeared, despite only showing up as a cameo since his debut and some fans even hope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Mineta</a> will be kicked out of the Hero Course and replaced with Shinso.
</li><li> Gentle Criminal can't seem to catch a break. Whether trying to become a hero in his younger years or being a villain when he got older, barely anyone acknowledged him, other than his only fan La Brava. To put it in prespective, Gentle created an online video sharing account and uploads video after video, each of which barely get any views. And the few comments that show up always seem to berate him. Meanwhile, Stain became an overnight sensation without even trying, as a <em>single</em> video featuring him leaked online, where he exclaims his true heroism ideals. Gentle could only wish for that amount of attention. If only he knew how much real world fans he had who sympathize with him, especially after seeing his backstory. It's to the point that some fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">wanted him to defeat Midoriya</a>!
</li></ul></li><li> L from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> isn't exactly well-liked in universe (having literally no friends and no social skills), but he is probably the most popular character with the fandom. Even those who don't like him do tend to have respect for his professional abilities.
<ul><li> Ditto his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>, Beyond Birthday, mainly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a> phenomenon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeltoraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeltoraQuest">Deltora Quest</a></em>: Doom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">leader</a> of the rebellion against the Shadow Lord is distrusted and outright hated by everyone from the Jasmine in main trio to members of his own revolution, but Doom beloved by the fans and especially those who read books. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Knowing full well that Doom is actually Jarred, loving father of Jasmine making her hatred of him beautifully ironic</span>.
<ul><li> Barda in books and anime is an disgraced guard, turned begger and despite his troubled status is adored by readers and viewers alike. The anime especially makes very entertaining and gives him some legitimate awesome fights towards the end of the series, complete with Ak-Baba decaptations sadly not present in the books.
</li><li> Thaegan the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">haggard</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch">beautiful</a> sorceress is loathed in the books but is given a more sympathetic portrayal in the anime making her a fan favorite helped by her attractiveness and wickedness.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dain was popular before and after he turn out to be a evil back stabbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">Ol</a> due to his fangirls, most people were happy when Lief "gave him the belt" however</span>.

GX</a></em> is fairly popular among the audience, but is continually mistreated in the series. A recurring joke is that the other characters interrupt him without ever bothering to apologize. At one point in the second season, he threw an important duel once promised that he would be treated better if he lost. (Ironically, it was the only time he dueled the entire season, and he was treated even <em>worse</em> afterwards.)
</li><li> (Ryou) Bakura gets even worse treatment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>.

The Abridged Series</a></em> is Jaden Yuki, who just can't catch a break from Yami/Yugi or Yusei, and they also hate his rapping, though that is a well regarded part of Jaden's shtick by the fans.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the constant demands by producers to make the show more humorous, the dubbed version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> had a lot of humor that poked fun at Davis' arrogant personality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Despite what you might think</a>, he was still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in the original.
</li><li> In the anime/manga series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge">Tenjho Tenge</a></em>, poor Masataka, despite being one of the most powerful characters in the series spends several of the early volumes being walked all over and generally mistreated by people, even if he could have beaten them with both hands tied behind his back. Fortunately, he starts to gain the respect of other characters as the series progresses, to the point where it is being hinted that he may be the key to resolving the plot of the entire series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Canada is ignored to the point of being invisible by pretty much all of the other nations.

In-universe, England's got a long-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis">rivalry</a> with France, his former-adopted-brother-now-possible-crush America keeps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage">shooting him down,</a> and even his former colonies don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">show him any respect.</a> Russia, meanwhile, has it <em>worse</em>; his subordinates are extremely terrified of him, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">older sister</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">too much issues</a> to deal with to spend time with him, the one person who likes him not only happens to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">younger sister</a>, but is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nut</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> as well, and everyone else either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">don't want him around</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">hates him.</a> Both of them only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">want to have friends</a>, but from the looks of it, they won't be getting any.
</li><li> Belarus for that matter definitely qualifies as this. She's aggressive, sadistic and foul-mouthed and very nasty to anyone who isn't her beloved brother, who she has an incestuous obsession with, so naturally most of the other characters are scared of her. Lithuania has a huge crush on her, but it's because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a> and doesn't even seem to notice when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">breaks his fingers</a>. In the fandom however, she's one of the most popular female characters for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">good looks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">cute outfit</a> and many find her caustic attitude and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> tendencies entertaining.

But he's so entertainingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">Laughably Evil</a> that he's one of the more popular characters outside of the show.
</li><li> Kururu/Kululu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> is supposedly the most unpopular character in the anime when mentioned in-universe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">excluding Dororo because no one remembers him</span>, and the narrator nags him occasionally for having a "bad personality". In reality, Kururu is often considered the most outstanding character in the whole show, and the negative in-universe attention has potential to bring in would-be fans/intensify preexisting fan-ism. They all seem to forget that his personality makes it rather just; would you hang out with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">perverted, near-sadistic FROG?</a> However, he's only popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">outside Japan</a>, making this slightly more justified.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Ali al-Saachez</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> is loathed by every single character on the show who is not paying him for something at the time. The fans? They're the ones singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"Prince Ali! Mighty is he!"</a>
</li><li> Patrick Colasour from <em>Gundam 00</em>, who underwent a very similar character arc (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> antagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">hangs on by sheer persistence</a>, eventually gets his happy ending). Unlike Jeremiah, Colasour was never intended as anything but a joke, which makes his eventual fate more surprising.
</li><li> Among all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">endless debates and disagreements</a> over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, one of the few things <em>everyone</em> agrees on is Rau Le Creuset being one of the best villains <em>Gundam</em> has ever produced. Obviously he's very much hated in-universe (such that only two characters in <em>Destiny</em> thought well of him, and both of them still opposed his goals), and for good reason since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he nearly succeeded in causing humanity to wipe itself out</span>, but as far as anyone in the real world is concerned Rau is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> of epic proportions, being one of the few <em>Gundam</em> villains (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Char Clone</a> to boot) to be completely evil and nefarious, yet holding a distinctive style and level of badass from those around him. Even fans who hate <em>SEED</em> in general often claim Rau was one of its saving graces.
</li></ul></li><li> Kanetsugu Naoe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HyakkaRyouranSamuraiGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HyakkaRyouranSamuraiGirls">Hyakka Ryouran Samurai Girls</a></em> can't win the respect of anyone in the show, often being ignored, beaten up, or both. In a poll taken before the anime began, she was the winner, and when the show aired, she earned the love of the fanbase for her delusional persistence.
</li><li> An example of this working to the character's benefit is Jeremiah Gottwald, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. While legitimately villainous in his first appearance, after getting defeated by Lelouch he gets treated like crap in the first season, both the fans <em>and</em> the show's makers adored him, which inspired the writers to change his story arc from an early death to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taking several levels in badass</a> and undergoing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> to join forces with protagonist Lelouch before finally receiving one of the few unambiguously happy endings out of the entire cast.

This is made even more curious by the fact Zenitsu is disliked by many of the girls he tries to impress, but is loved by a fandom that has a gigantic female presence in it.
</li><li> Chiri of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak">Neat Freak</a> who doesn't receive a lot of in-series affection on account of those traits. Nearly everyone fears her, she's the only student that Nozomu seems to dislike, and in one instance, a public park is shown to have a sign prohibiting her from being there and disturbing the peace. However, she's one of the more popular characters in the series because of how crazy she is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>, Wild Tiger/Kotetsu Kaburagi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">low popularity as a superhero</a> is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> — a stark contrast to the real world, where he's not only <em>the</em> most popular character of the show, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-06-13/biglobe-poll/favorite-character-in-spring-2011-anime">also of the entire Spring 2011 anime season<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Kanda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. Because of his attitude not many characters apear to like him at all including Allen. Minor characters, such as finders, hate him and even the characters that do like him have a bit of an issue with his attitude. Only Lavi normally doesn't seem to be bothered by that, but gets annoyed from time to time. Despite this he is quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">popular with fan girls...</a>
</li><li> Akari Akaza from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri">Yuru-Yuri</a></em>. She's constantly fighting against the world to get people aware of her existence (and hopefully not get hurt in the process), with only a scant few supporters, such as Sakurako. As for the fans, she always makes her way into show discussion precisely because of her lack of focus.

However, he never "wins" in his eyes, and gets a fair amount of abuse. In the fandom, he's indisputably the most popular character of the series, having more than three times the votes of the titular character in one poll.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>: Ladd Russo, who's understandably disliked by most characters by virtue of being a totally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">off-his-rocker</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a>.

Super powerful, <em>downright annoying and loony</em> as far as the other characters think, it says something that he singlehandedly created some sort of "DO NOT WANT" emoticon/meme (ﺧ益ﺨ).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em>, the young mob boss Clair Leonelli is easily one of the most popular and well-known characters, but at least initially he's opposed both by the heroes (because he's a violent criminal they have to stop) and by the other members of his crime organization (because he's so young and mentally unstable), and generally surrounded by people who want to screw him over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>, Yuzuki Seo is brash, selfish, aggressive and has a knack for saying exactly the right thing to piss people off without even meaning to do it. Apart from Sakura, just about everyone finds her annoying. Of course, the audience is watching from the sidelines where she is instead one of the funniest members of the cast by sheer virtue of how incredibly obnoxious she is.
</li><li> Second brother and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> Karamatsu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em> is most often ridiculed, physically abused or outright ignored (depending on which is funniest) by the rest of the cast, but especially the Western fandom, ironically or genuinely, adores him. This is even mentioned in an episode where Karamatsu himself says that the showrunners have been receiving letters from viewers that feel sorry for him.
<ul><li> Ichimatsu often causes this reaction too. However, his reputation is not as bad as Karamatsu's.

This is mostly because his strength is simply so unbelievable that whenever he beats an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">opponent in one punch</a>, the people assume that other heroes must have weakened it first and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">cherry-tapped</a> it for the final blow. Saitama himself does little to dispel these rumors, since he doesn't want to take away the public's faith in the other heroes out there. There is a small group of people (notably Genos) who have witnessed enough of Saitama's strength to know he's the real deal, but they're definitely a minority, and not all of them like him for it.

</li><li> Envy is an even bigger case in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the first anime</a>, where he's even crueler and more sadistic than his manga counterpart with no redeeming qualities, and nobody in the cast has a positive view of him. In the '03 fandom's heyday, he was consistently ranking in the top 5. In this version he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and a lot more badass and manipulative, making him a compelling antagonist in a different way and arguably more important, but what really got him so popular was his personal vendetta against Edward and goals of murdering his father motivated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him being the failed transmutation of Edward's half-brother</span>.

In the fandom, hes one of the most popular antagonists, especially the manga version for his unique philosophy, class and sense of style. The 2003 version is not as popular as he's more of a one-note psycho, but he's still very memorable and entertaining to the fandom for how gleefully hammy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a> he is.

<ul><li> Spidey himself, and arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>: one of the most beloved and popular of all super heroes in real life, in addition to being one of Marvel's flagship characters; but widely feared and distrusted by the Marvel U. public with frustrating consistency. One of the key factors that made him such an effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> at the time of his creation, it's become an integral part of his character to the point that he has it worse than pretty much anyone else in the Marvel U. (where practically everyone who isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> has to deal with this, and even they have had their moments).
</li><li> Linked to Spider-Man is his recurring enemy Shocker. He's widely regarded as a loser and a coward by the rest of the supervillain community and isn't taken very seriously by any of the superheroes he's battled (<em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> went as far as to depict him as a pathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>). And yet he's one of the most beloved villains in the Marvel Universe due to being a professional, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who relies on his wits and skill to get him through the day. Even in-universe he points out that all the things he gets mocked for are the traits that keep him a.) out of jail, b.) alive, and c.) not bogged down in a pointless feud with Spider-Man.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> The X-Men as a team are much the same, they are hated by most of citizenry of the Marvel Universe because they're mutants, in fact the comic largely revolves around this, but they are among Marvel's most popular superheroes. This made for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironic</a> situation: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, the X-Men are feared and hated by those they protect while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> are "Earth's Mightiest Heroes". In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, X-Men was Marvel's most popular team book and a flagship series, while Avengers was considered a second-tier title filled with B and C-list characters until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> all boosted its popularity a great deal.
</li><li> Cyclops was never the most popular X-Man in or out of universe, often seen as the least interesting member of the X-Men, and actively disliked by some for his straight-laced, sometimes brusque and cold personality. However, Marvel's treatment of him post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em> has turned him into this. He's reviled as a monster on the level of <em>Hitler</em> by the general public, his former lifelong friends and his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">time-displaced teenage self</a>, however many fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">agree with him</a>. It doesn't help that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> occurred when the X-Men were at the bottom of Marvel's priority list, and suffering from serious mishandling as a result. Fans started to develop sympathy for him, mostly out of frustration at how unfairly he was treated, or as part of the wider backlash to unpopular creative decisions at the time, such as the unwanted pushing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans">The Inhumans</a> as a replacement for the X-Men, established characterisation being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">completely disregarded</a> in service of plot lines and regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall">contrived</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">conflicts</a> between good guys. This peaked with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfX">Death of X</a></em>, which Marvel spent a full year building up as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> and then completely fumbled, showing him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dying a horrible death while trying to save the entire mutant race</span>. Eventually, they had no choice but to bring him back as a hero.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em>, on his own comic book, is depicted as being the butt monkey of almost, if not all, of his friends, and his own girlfriend, Ramona, to the point that (being played for laughs), Stephen Stills told Knives Chau (Scott's previous short-term girlfriend, and stalker) that EVERYBODY hates Scott. To the reader, Scott is just a shy, cute, awkward, video gamer guy, who's trying to come out into the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> as the story goes on and Scott is deconstructed due making the same mistakes and revealing to be not as good as initially thought. This created a backlash against the character. However, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, he won back the audience.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> might be one of Marvel's most popular characters right now, but he's disliked by heroes and villains alike. He's one of the most talented mercenaries in the Marvel Universe (he beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> with his hands cuffed behind his back) but he can barely get a job because of his bad reputation. That and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> normally kicking in only when he's employed by the bad guy, and vice versa for when he's working with the heroes...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>: Rorschach. This is an unintentional example, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> didn't intend for Rorschach to be as popular as he was. Moore intended Rorschach to be somewhat sympathetic and intriguing, and even claimed he was his second favorite character at the time of writing (the Comedian being the first). It's more that he was taken by surprise by the large number of fans who think Rorschach is absolutely right about absolutely everything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a></em>: Whirl, twice voted the most likely autobot to defect, and when a party is held to dress up as one's most hated person, most of the crew dresses as Whirl. Out of universe this is his first grand roll in fiction and is liked for being a hilariously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> badass.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin">Original Sin</a></em>, it seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a> wasn't very well-liked by anybody other than Steve and Natasha while he was a superhero. Even Nick Fury, who mentored Bucky after he came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, said he never liked Bucky (though it was an LMD, they generally act how Nick acts). Bucky himself is a very big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a>, who averted being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for Captain America, to the point that readers actually <em>didn't want</em> Steve Rogers returning to the role, and even got second billing in a critically acclaimed movie. May be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> for Jason Aaron, since this isn't shown anywhere else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> doesn't exactly win popularity contests in the Marvel Universe. Villains hate him since he spends all his time slaughtering them, while other heroes hate him for how much of a ruthless, violent psycho he is, and the few times they do work with him it's going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">strained at best</a>.

</li><li> Marvel Universe villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron">Ultron</a> is feared and hated by both hero and villain alike for his ruthlessness, sociopathy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">genocidal ambitions</a>. In the real world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">those traits are what's led to him being considered one of the best Marvel villains</a>.

Well, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipRevolvingDoor">even she's had her days</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">Anyone that knows him hates him with a passion</a> and simply can't tolerate him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">including other villains</a>), because he's such an unpredictable, maniacal sociopath. This hatred also spans other universes, because as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>, the <em>entire MK cast</em> makes it clear how much they despise him, with several of them having no issue with killing him. And yet, he's hailed as not only one of the most popular villains of comic book history, but also pop culture.

He's a lonely kid who always fails, the other characters rarely respect him, he has very few friends who treat him well and even they have their moments of treating him like trash - fans <em>love</em> him. When he gets only rocks at Halloween, bags of candy flood in from fans as gifts for him, and when he gets no Valentines from his class, fans send him them by the hundreds. Why, you might ask? Mainly, it's because a lot of people know exactly how he feels, because they've been there throughout their own lives.

Up until he got into a relationship with Liz, his dog and his parents were the only ones who ever really liked him. He's constantly belittled by his cat, people tend to hate him within a few seconds of meeting him, and he drives women away in droves, and that's when he's just trying to get a date, not to mention ones he's actually dated, who frequently go to ridiculous extremes to avoid him, but he's pretty popular with fans.

Only Sansa is even <em>slightly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">fond of him</a>; every single other character (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">there are many</a>) thinks he's frighteningly unpleasant at best.

</li><li> Tyrion does have a <em>few</em> friends and allies, but ultimately even they are either killed or abandon him, and everyone else... His father and sister despise him, the court finds him repulsive, and the common people call him things like "twisted little monkey" and very unjustly blame him for all the problems of the realm. Absolutely nothing works out well for Tyrion in the long run, even though he's very clever and is one of the few characters attempting to be heroic. Perhaps due both to his misfortune and his considerable wit, however, he's among the most popular POV character among fans and even the author himself.
</li><li> Brienne of Tarth, a lesser noble woman unfortunately born with an unattractive, manly appearance, who as only heir to her father took it upon herself to become knight. In-universe she is constantly made fun of for her ugliness and not taken seriously as knight. Among the fans she's popular for her prowess as well as taking her vows and oaths as knight seriously, one of the few to do so, but also for showing a gentler, more feminine side, and not being someone who just goes round killing people. Basically, the fandom has a soft spot for good characters who subvert the in-universe expectation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a>.
</li><li> Daenerys has elements of this as well. Even her own people don't really like her for much of her arc, she grew up with an abusive brother, something made only more pitiful by her moon-eyed narration. Later on, she had smother her husband to death after someone she thought she could trust rendered him catatonic. Add in the fact that her current political activities have amounted to sinking three nations into murderous anarchy and at least one campaign of mass-murder and the fact that she has pets she thinks of as her cute little children that eat people, and it's not hard to understand why the other characters find her less of the charming and strong young woman the audience usually sees and more of a crazy Bond villain who might strike unpredictably in any direction at any moment.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister is reviled behind his back and known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathbreaker">Kingslayer</a> for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardBetrayal">Bodyguard Betrayal</a> of King Aerys II, among a few other horrible things he's done. For a while this was the attitude among fans, until he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">POV character</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords">A Storm of Swords</a></em>, and we got the story behind his killing of Aerys. Afterwards he became one of the most beloved and sympathetic characters among the fans because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">his desire to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">redeem himself of other crimes he's committed</a>.
</li><li> There is a grand total of two people in-universe who like Stannis Baratheon, one of whom is his daughter; although almost everyone respects him as both a masterful commander and a truly just man who will see the guilty punished and the virtuous rewarded while his troops will follow him to the bitter end. Out of story, he's by far the most popular character who doesn't have a point of view, tends to rank in the top ten even with them, and his fanbase of self-proclaimed King's Men are fiercely loyal to him. In large part this is because of his very modern sensibilities; he promotes by virtue of merit rather than birth, favors a centralized society over decentralized feudalism, and is uncomfortable at best with religion if not a downright atheist-but it also helps that he came riding to the rescue of the Night's Watch while everyone else was busy slaughtering each other for the throne, is the only person in any position of power who takes the Others seriously as a threat, swore to avenge the Starks despite his dislike of them, and has a hilariously dry sense of humor. His brother Renly is quite the opposite, a charismatic charmer who easily rallied a massive army to his cause; but is universally despised by the fans due to his total lack of substance, his antiquated view on society, his mocking of both Brienne and Shireen's appearance, and his attempt to usurp his brother's rightful position. Even Stannis' detractors don't tend to hold killing Renly against him, especially as Renly was clearly intending to have Stannis killed and shows no remorse about it, and Stannis is clearly upset at having to resort to killing his brother, and there is a very good argument that he isn't aware of his role in his brother's death, yet still feels responsible.
</li><li> Stannis' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">loyal Knight</a> Ser Davos Seaworth also gets this. He is looked down upon by many of the lords and nobility for being new nobility, as Davos was a smuggler who grew up poor but was knighted for Stannis when he smuggled food to him during a siege. However, Davos throughout the books shows himself to be one of the most decent and kind characters, always trying to do the most moral thing while at the same time showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> to Stannis despite Stannis' orders sometimes conflicting with Davos' morality. Also Davos acts as a useful contrast to other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber">social climbers</a> like the arrogant and corrupt Janos Slynt and the manipulative and treacherous Petyr Baelish, always trying to be humble and feeling unworthy of the honors Stannis gives him, such as when he is made a Lord and Hand of the King by Stannis.
</li><li> Edmure Tully is not treated well in-universe by his uncle Brynden Tully and nephew Robb Stark for messing up their military plan by holding back Tywin Lannister at the Fords. His sister Catelyn sees him as young and foolish, and doesn't like the way he lets smallfolk into Riverrun for protection. However he is very well-liked among the fandom, many people thinking it was unfair to blame him for the strategic failures as he hadn't been informed of the plan and understandably misunderstood the order hold Riverrun. He also seems to be one of the few Lords who actually takes his duty of protecting his people seriously and would make a great ruler in peacetime. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And despite marrying Roslin Frey at the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty">Red Wedding</a>, where his sister and nephew were murdered along with a large part of his army by his treacherous father-in-law Lord Walder Frey, and he was made a prisoner of the Lannisters, he doesn't hold it against his wife and genuinely loves her, saying she was forced into it by her family.</span>
</li><li> The crannogmen in general and the Reeds (Howland, Jojen and Meera) particular are victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> in-universe due to being one of the poorest lands in Westeros and living in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil">mysterious swamps</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HillbillyHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HillbillyHorrors">away from civilization</a>.

Among the fandom, she's probably the only character just about everyone likes. Of course, she becomes quite popular in-story during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Book 7</a>, where she ends up one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> alongside the likes of Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley.
</li><li> Severus Snape is really unpopular in the books among his peers and students, but he's easily one of the most popular characters in the fandom. So popular, in fact, that in a poll that ran after the seventh book came out he was voted the best character in the entire <em>series</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>: Leah, the only female werewolf. Everybody in-story seems to hate her, but some people especially will argue that she's the most badass and well-developed character in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>, Simon is constantly mocked and belittled by the Shadowhunters for being a "mundane", no matter what he does. Even Clary, his childhood friend and love interest can hardly be bothered to remember him most of the time. A number of fans, especially those not overly fond of the Shadowhunters, love him for his snark, geeky personality, and willingness to do nice things for Clary. It helps that he's one of few not afraid to call out Jace on being a jerk.
</li><li> Caine Soren from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GONE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GONE">GONE</a></em> had this in spades.

In-universe he's looked down by his fellow vampires because they mistook his pacifism for weakness, and the only one that seems to like him is Darren. Among the series' fans, however, he's one of the most popular characters and were sad when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he betrayed the clan in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> moment and ultimately executed</span>.

</li><li> Ben Chang.

</li><li> Pierce Hawthorne is the only character hated more in-show (and in the case of his actor, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>) than both Britta and Chang, and yet is loved by the fans for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a> humor.
</li><li> Perhaps subverted with Abed, however, who is perhaps the most popular of the main characters in the show, while <em>also</em> apparently being much better liked among the Greendale student body than his other friends.
</li><li> Actually, from what we can gather, the group as a whole (referred to as the Greendale Seven, rarely in a positive tone) seems to be a bit of an annoyance to the rest of the student body for the trouble they cause and the Dean's very obvious favoritism toward them.

</li><li> Sam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> is disliked and feared by many in-universe, but is by far the most popular character in the fandom, though her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> in later series led her to becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> among some fans.
</li><li> Dwight Schrute from the U.S. version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> is a fan favorite but in-universe is generally considered annoying by the other characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> has Arnold Judas Rimmer. The fact that the other characters regularly go out of their way to tell us how unlikable Rimmer is probably just makes the fans more defiant.

Fans, however, like his capacity for comedy... and his ability to curse violently in Czech. It also helps that he showed a little <em>wonder</em> at getting to do what some of us would give our left arm to do, as evidenced by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyShouldHaveSentAPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyShouldHaveSentAPoet">poetic description</a> of Atlantis' rising.

The drug dealers hate him because he robs them and makes them look foolish and the cops hate him because he kills people and gets away with it. But the random people on the street practically worship him because he's such a badass, and audiences love him and regularly name him as the best and most liked character.

</li><li> Tyrion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> is mentioned in the Literature section as well, but it's worth repeating him here, because the TV version is possibly <em>even more</em> popular with fans, being played masterfully by Peter Dinklage.

<ul><li> Alistair is, while not <em>hated</em>, at least viewed as rather annoying and childish by many of the other companions, with even the most positive opinions of him being condescending. Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade">fans</a>, on the other hand, find him hilarious, adorable, or some combination of both.
</li><li> From the same game, nobody in the party (except possibly the PC) likes Morrigan, but many fans like her for her acerbic wit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a> qualities.

In fact, a lot of Luigi's problems in universe, especially in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> games, is that he <em>can</em> be as good as Mario, but nobody gives him a chance. This has gotten to the point that Nintendo declared 2013 to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheYearOfLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheYearOfLuigi">The Year of Luigi</a> to celebrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansionDarkMoon">three games</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperLuigiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperLuigiU">Luigi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">stars in</a>.

Outside of the games, a sizable portion of the fanbase loves him for various reasons, including being an underdog (due to his plans often backfiring, the fact that he's never had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, and even Nintendo themselves occasionally teasing him), having great levels tied to him (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em>'s Waluigi Pinball), going through bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> and just plain hilarious ridiculousness (like trying to take over the world with his <em>dance moves</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolutionMarioMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolutionMarioMix">Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix</a></em>), creating several memes (including "Waluigi time!", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioStrikers">crotch chop</a>, and Waluigi's Taco Stand), and various combinations of the above. Nintendo once ran a poll asking who you would give a Valentine to, and while their polls usually pull in a couple thousand votes per option, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Waluigi/comments/dutfr2/dont_know_if_yall_saw_this_but_i_think_we_are/">Waluigi totaled<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> more than 1.25 <em>million</em> votes by the end of March of 2019, becoming the only character on the poll to break a million; for comparison, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> Isabelle received the second highest number of votes, and she still didn't even reach half of Waluigi's total. In spite of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodCharacter">lack of presence outside of spinoffs</a>, Waluigi has managed to pull in a dedicated group of fans, and support for him to get a starring role anywhere, whether in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> or headlining his very own title, is very easy to find on the internet.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, Tails from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> franchise is often a "victim" of this, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em>.
<ul><li> Knuckles seems to be leaning into this area as well due to recent Flanderization. He's bitterly jealous of Sonic and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">dopiness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">lack of "team ethics"</a> has even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Cream the Rabbit</a> making snide remarks at him at times, neverless he has a fanbase nearly as big as the hedgehog himself (granted however, Knuckles was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> even before his transition into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>).
</li><li> Same for Dr. Eggman, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, where the poor guy's really just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> at heart.
</li></ul></li><li> Yosuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is liked enough amongst most fans. It's not uncommon for him to end up as the butt of a joke. It's a different story when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">the laughter stops</a>: See any scene involving Saki.
</li><li> Raven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>. At best, everyone tolerates him. Usually, the party members are disgusted by his antics, mostly because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> and refuses to act his age. Most of the time they don't even call him Raven; they just call him, "old man". He's still one of the group until the end.
</li><li> Lots of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fan works (and some canon) show their love for characters like Hong Meiling, Cirno, and Reisen Udongein Inaba by making them into all-round <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a> abused by their superiors.
<ul><li> Tenshi Hinanai too, despite the amount of damage she caused all because she got bored of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">Fluffy Cloud Heaven</a>.
</li><li> More recently, Kogasa Tatara has become an <em>epic</em> example of this. She is pathetically weak, doomed to failure at every turn and every other character either ignores or mocks her. The fandom, however, has declared her to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">the new youkai moe~</a> and love her intensely.
</li><li> Koishi Komeiji who debuted in <em>Touhou Chireiden: Subterranean Animism</em> is the biggest example for this trope from Touhou franchise. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/THWiki_Popularity_Poll">Koishi is the only character other than Reimu, Marisa, and Sakuya to win Fan Popularity Poll (2015)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Koishi's existence is somewhat vague to other characters save for few such as Satori (her sister) and Kokoro (her storyline rival) thanks to her ability to control unconscious minds. Furthermore, many people who interacted with her and did as much as look to the other way would eventually forget about her.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Dan Hibiki</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>.

Dan gets blasted through a door following an unfortunate encounter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Kazuya Mishima</a> on his way to a face-to-face with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter">Ryu</a>. He's the only other character seen in the trailer besides the two flagship fighting game characters, which lends credence to his status as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> with a following. In <em>SFxT</em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2011-x-rush-system-interview/715452">according to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Yoshinori Ono</a>, Kazuya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByCameo">killed</a></em> Dan (this is because the dev team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooOutTheClowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooOutTheClowns">didn't want Dan in the game</a>).

For the fans however, he's easily the most beloved and memorable characters out of the three game protagonists thanks to that very same psychotic nature. Trevor's popularity are also helped by his surprisingly complex personality with many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> that makes him an entertaining yet also relatable character.

</li><li> Also, Hazama/Yuuki Terumi.

</li><li> Lemina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> is loud, pushy, money-grubbing, has her fair share of blonde moments, and is somewhat lacking in integrity from time to time (despite her respectable long term goals). She's sometimes viewed as a slight annoyance by the rest of the group, and certainly by people outside of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>'s Yuffie, certainly not without justification seeing as how she's a thief that attacked the party and tried to trick them after the fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If you head to her home town, it'll turn out that the party was right to be suspicious.

</li><li> In terms of human characters, Team Skull is treated as a group of nuisances and losers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, but out of universe their comedic qualities, strong personalities, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> surprisingly sad backstory</span> resulted in the group being one of the most popular villain teams in the franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> Fukushima Masanori is one of the better known historical Japanese generals, leader of the <em>Seven Spears of Shizugatake</em>, and one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>'s finest (and wasn't reported to be as brutal as his fellow general Katou Kiyomasa, who takes anti-Christianiy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>). However, whenever he makes appearance in KOEI games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a>-like game <em>Saihai no Yukue</em>), he is usually portrayed as a bumbling fool nearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> level to possibly make Ishida Mitsunari (main protagonist of the latter game) look good. Koei truly hates Masanori.
</li><li> Norman Jayden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em> <em>definitely</em> qualifies. The poor guy is abused by every police officer in the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> constantly getting the crap beaten out of him, and doesn't have a <em>single</em> happy ending</span> But he's easily the most popular character outside of the game.
</li><li> Tingle is one, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">only in Japan</a>. Even his own father hates him.
<ul><li> In <em>Majora's Mask</em>, Tingle's father is certainly embarassed by his son's obsession with fairies, but it doesn't go as far as hate. Notably, if you bring him a pictograph of Tingle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he'll reward you with a heart piece.</span> The Tingle of <em>The Wind Waker</em>, on the other hand, is clearly viewed as bizarre at best and outright disliked by the laborers on his island - two of whom are his brothers!
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Glass Joe. He may be the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">Jobber</a> with more defeats than most champions have victories, but he'll always be the champion in players' hearts.
</li><li> Aran Ryan (at least in the Wii version) is a complete psycho who breaks all the rules and is greeted with a chorus of boos from the in-game audience. He also happens to be one of the most popular characters.
</li><li> Super Macho Man (Also wii version), is met with more audible boos than Aran Ryan, and the crowd cheers harder for when you knock him down than the other combatants. Despite this, he is loved by the fanbase for his overinflated ego and how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> he can be. Add that to the amount of things he says falling under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Erik from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier">Rune Factory Frontier</a></em>. Despite his sheer awesomeness, he has to bribe people in game to appear impressed by him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey">Epic Mickey</a></em>: Oswald the Lucky Rabbit leans a bit into this trope. In the game, he's portrayed as a vengeful and jealous antihero regarding Mickey's popularity. Though he improves, he's constantly pained with the knowledge that Mickey received his fame. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, Oswald's inclusion was one of the key aspects which drew people into the game, and he has a solid fanbase in Japan.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> series has Claptrap, who's a bit of an odd case. In the first game, the Claptraps were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">the Scrappy</a>. After that, however, the writers noticed the fandom's negative opinion and went wild with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">Take That, Scrappy!</a> moments. This actually led to him getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> — the constant, relentless abuse made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">downright pitiful</a>, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> tendencies eventually gave way to an endearingly earnest incompetence.
</li><li> Papyrus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> has three people in the Underground who give him the time of day, and one of them's his brother. The others are Undyne, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">a soulless flower who's repeatedly killed him</a> before you show up.</span> Naturally, the main reason he wants to be a Royal Guardsman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">is because people might actually want to be his friend afterwards.</a> The fandom, meanwhile, pretty much universally loves him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">the cinnamon roll that he is.</a>
</li><li> Arguably Altair of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em>. Altair has status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> among fans and the distinction as the first playable character in the series, but many of the other Assassins in-game don't think very highly of him because of his arrogance, to the point that he violates all three tenants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Assassin's Creed</a> and is demoted to novice by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">Al Mualim</a>. In particular, Malik—who loses his arm and his brother because of Altair—is pretty unforgiving of him for what he did previously. However, Altair's actions are appreciated by many NPC civilians, who call him a hero, and most of the Assassins warm up to him over time. It zigzags a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em> where the Assassins are divided between supporting either Altair or another Assassin named Abbas.
<ul><li> And by the end of the first game Malik turned from strongest hater to closest confident and friend so Altair does more than just zigzag this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> The Maple Heights district of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase">Criminal Case</a></em> introduces Adam Bentley, a forerunning socialite whom the Grimsborough PD dislike for being a pretentious creep who frequently hangs around rich and powerful people — most of whom ended up dying — while the rest of the districts looks down on him for not having an affluent background. He seems to be quite well-liked by the audience, and his murder gathered more than a few mourners among fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> has a few particularly successful cases of this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Edwin Odesseiron</a>: In-universe an arrogant and entitled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> who fellow party members will mock and refuse to take serious at best, and attempt to violently murder at worst, Edwin is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a> taken to its logical conclusion; i.e. he has no friends at all and not even the dialogue choices with him for the player generally offer a friendly response. Among the fandom Edwin is not only widely considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">his humorous failures</a>, but also has a respectable amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">Fangirls</a> (enough to star in his own romance mods!), and an infamous reputation among game-players as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> to such an extent that he can effortlessly outperform player-made mages.

Characters often compare him unfavorably to Liu Kang in terms of skill but he has been a consistent fan-favorite since his debut for his unique abilities. Liu Kang, on the other hand tends to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> among fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Johnny Cage</a> qualifies as well.

<ul><li> Yoshiki Kishinuma.

He's also easily one of the most popular characters in the series, for being very level-headed in a crisis, surprisingly kind-hearted, and because fans just sympathize with the poor guy.
</li><li> Sakutarou Morishige, to a lesser extent. He suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">Loners Are Freaks</a> in-universe due to being so anti-social, but fans like him either because they can relate to that aspect of him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">creepy hobby</a> later in the game is equal parts entertaining and tragic.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagito</span>, Kokichi, and Miu from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa">Danganronpa</a></em> franchise are treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a> within their respective stories. However, while some fans view them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">divisive characters</a>, they have very loyal fanbases. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/5gvti9/rdanganronpa_character_ranking_poll_results_top/">A Reddit poll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ended up placing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagito</span> at the top ten and <a class="urllink" href="http://news.mynavi.jp/ad/2017/entertainment/danganronpa/sp_r/">the official NDRV3 popularity poll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had Kokichi and Miu at #2 and #4 respectively.

The fanbase love them, however, particularly as both have fairly tragic backstories.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally speaking, with the Phantom Thieves from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> receiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">All of the Other Reindeer</a> treatment, a few of these are bound to happen. However, these people deserve special mention-
<ul><li> Ryuji Sakamoto is ostracized by his former track teammates because he was indirectly responsible for getting the team shut down-even though he was trying to call out Kamoshidas abusive behavior. While hes not disliked by the other Thieves, hes definitely the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the group and they tend to make comments at his expense. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">the Western fanbase</a> <em>adores</em> Ryuji due to his endearing, friendly personality and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">bromance with the protagonist</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">many of his fans are not fond of</a> the scene where he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">beaten up offscreen by the female Thieves</a> after they escape the last palace.
</li><li> The other students at Kosei High treat Yusuke Kitagawa differently due to both his association with Madarame and because of his behavior in general, and after Madarame is arrested, he's actively shunned. However, he manages to be one of the most popular characters in the game due to him being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallySerious">Comically Serious</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>.
</li><li> Upon her introduction it is clear that Makoto Niijima is not very well-liked among her classmates. In fact, it's implied that she didn't have any friends before joining the Phantom Thieves. While some do see her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a>, she has still gained numerous amounts of attention. She ranked number 3 on a popularity poll in Japan and after the game's international release got even more popularity with increased amounts of fanart and being one of the most popular shipping options with Joker.
</li><li> Prior to Futaba Sakura being a shut-in, she was almost completely friendless at school with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> having to be a girl named Kana in which their friendship ended up falling apart. On the other hand, fans really like her due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> personality, having huge amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and her lacking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">Annoying Video-Game Helper</a> tendencies that past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> characters have.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Alice Angel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BendyAndTheInkMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BendyAndTheInkMachine">Bendy and the Ink Machine</a></em> got a lessthan-stellar reception upon her release.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> has very clear in-universe popularity rankings for each of the units which often diverge greatly from reality. In-universe, fine is the clear top unit and Akatsuki second, while in reality those two tend to be among the least popular. (Though this is justified by the fact that real-world readers are privy to a lot of information about fine's bad behaviour that the in-universe audience are not, and fine's popularity is at least in part due to Eichi's deliberate manipulation.) By contrast, Knights is definitely the top unit in the real world, with Undead and Ryuuseitai up next. And while Ra*bits isn't hugely popular, it's a hell of a lot more known out of universe than in universe, where they're a very new unit who got off to a <em>very</em> shaky start (thanks, again, to Eichi and Akatsuki).

The fanbase however finds her quite intriguing and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">hilarious</a>.

His balloon story doesn't even <em>begin</em> to cover it. He was forced to wear dresses, after his mother believed they were having a girl, but it was a boy. He also had to become a garden gnome, moved to NYC after he was kidnapped, etc. One has to believe whenever or not he is really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">misunderstood guy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: Mojo Jojo. He would always be the butt of jokes, and he never wins. But in real life, fans love him due to how funny he is. And let's not forget of how he speaks. Being the villain who appears the most, he's obviously the one who takes the most damage.

Stimpy tries to cheer Ren up by making him the president of Stimpy's Fan Club, but this just drives Ren to new levels of psychosis (and for Ren, that's really saying something). The next week, Nickelodeon got a truckload of letters from children telling Ren they loved him too.

He's one of the least popular kids at his school and a hopeless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in the show, but in the fanbase, he's one of the most popularly quoted characters.

<ul><li> The Crystal Gems initially can't stand Peridot because a.) she's one of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Homeworld gems that they've been fighting for centuries</span> and b.) she is obnoxious and annoying. It's even implied that her own allies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">tolerate her at best</a>. Although these issues lessened as the plot moved on, they were very much <em>there</em> for quite a while. Meanwhile, the fans have pretty much always <em>loved</em> her and she quickly became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">a popular character</a> thanks to her antics and complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">inability to be threatening</a>.

Out-of-universe she is quite possibly the most popular character outside of the protagonists thanks to her cute design and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">tragic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">story</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Jasper is highly respected for being a pinnacle of gemkind. None of our heroes like her though; this is compounded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em> when Jasper is one of the few gems interested in preserving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Homeworld</a>'s former warlike ethos. Though Jasper has committed morally reprehensible actions, it is hinted, then outright confirmed, that the circumstances of her "birth", combined with Homeworld's fascism, has left her with a deep, abiding sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">self-loathing</a>, that is only ameliorated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">her deep, abiding love for her diamond</a>. This, along with her beefy physique, makes her a <em>very</em> popular character.

<ul><li> Kenny is killed off on a regular basis for five seasons, bullied and insulted by all of his friends, and generally treated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">like dirt</a>. Of course, as soon as he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, the fans were in uproar, and he was back for good by the end of the season.
</li><li> Subsequently, the character of Butters has taken Kenny's place as the fan-loved, but terribly treated character.
</li><li> According to Craig in "Pandemic," <em>the entire main cast</em> qualifies as this. Cartman, being a sociopath, comes as no surprise, but Stan and Kyle are disliked because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">their propensity towards getting involved in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> that end up with them getting shot into space or stranded in Peru, which: A) only happens to them, out of all the children in South Park, and B) is their fault, according to — well, everyone in South Park.
</li><li> Pip, who nobody in the show seems to like (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">the creators</a>) but has lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFanservice">fanart</a>.

<ul><li> Squidward Tentacles is often berated, loathed, and disrespected by most of the rest of the characters; which is pretty understandable considering a majority of the time he is a selfish and lazy jerk. That has not stopped countless fans however from sympathizing with his misfortunes and appreciating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> moments.
</li><li> SpongeBob himself seems to be despised by nearly everyone in Bikini Bottom, to the point where they actually have a holiday dedicated to getting away from him. This is however a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">zigzagged</a> example, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">in other episodes</a> Spongebob is practically a town hero who is adored by all.
</li></ul></li><li> Furrball from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> is an unwanted stray cat who is often abused and unable to find a home with anyone but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge">Elmyra</a> (who's the most frequent source of said abuse). His status as the show's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> is epitomized in the lyrics to the opening theme, "Furrball's unlucky," complimented by a piano falling on him as he's happily sniffing a flower. Yet he's quite popular for a relatively minor character, with numerous fanart and fanfiction devoted to him. Being both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> probably helps a lot, as quite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> commenters on his shorts express their desire to see him get a home. To say nothing of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">fans who want to see him "get lucky" in the form of a certain purple skunkette from the same show...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>: The former of the titular duo is not only more often than not the loser of the two's altercations at the end of many shorts, he is loathed by almost everyone else in the show, and most of them even take Jerry's side during the two's frequent quarrels. This, however, doesn't stop Tom from receiving a rather popular fanbase in which about 60% of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">would root for him to win at the end</a>, usually because Jerry either started the conflict between the two for no reason at all or took his retribution towards Tom too far (as well as the fact that Jerry often portrays a rodent who steals more food than he really needs from the kitchen and Tom is <em>ordered</em> by his owners to get rid of the mouse). Luckily, in many of those instances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">Tom ends up getting the last laugh at the end</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>
<ul><li> Chris is hated by the majority of the contestants in-universe, but some of the fans find him to be an interesting part of the show.
</li><li> Don from <em>The Ridonculous Race</em> could count. While Don was hated less by the contestants (only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Ice Dancers</a>, Laurie, and Gerry hated him), some of the fans that liked Chris didn't think [Don] was an interesting host.
</li><li> Heather is a perfect example, she was the most hated character in-universe (until Alejandro showed up), but is a fan favorite and has one of the largest fan bases out of every character in the show.
</li><li> While Duncan was one of the most popular characters in the show, the vast majority of the contestants in TDA hated him in-universe. This was evident in the TDA finale, where Duncan won in a close [3-4] vote in his ending.
</li><li> Cody during <em>Island</em>, who was disliked by most of the girls in-universe, but was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> in the fanbase. In <em>World Tour</em> this gets reversed where he's a favorite in-universe, but becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> out-universe.
</li><li> Harold is fairly popular in the fan base, but was deemed a loser and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in the series. Though much like Cody he becomes more liked in-universe as the series progresses.
</li><li> Courtney, in a sense. She's very unpopular with most of the other contestants because of her bossiness and "win at all costs"-attitude. However in real life, while she's currently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a>, she has one of the largest and most vocal fanbases.
</li><li> Noah is not very liked in the show, due to his condescending, sarcastic know-it-all, slacker nature. But in the fan base he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, and unlike Cody his support has not waned.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Ezekiel</a> was hated by the female campers before his transformation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">utterly feared by everyone afterwards</a>, but he's built up quite a fanbase that thinks of him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic">and want him to get another chance</a>, and are hoping for him to be reverted back to his human self.
</li><li> Scott in <em>All-Stars</em> arguably qualifies. He still carries his hatred from <em>Revenge of the Island</em> in the show, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass">increased stupidity</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">earned him a lot of fans from his very large hate base</a>.
</li><li> Samey from <em>Pahkitew Island</em> could possibly be the best candidate for the show to represent this trope. In that season, she is not strongly well-liked by her fellow contestants (except Jasmine, who understood her the most) due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully">bullying sister</a> Amy making them believe that she's "horrible at everything". At contrast in real life, many fans have shown their huge love for her because of how she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">genuinely sympathetic and kindhearted</a>, as opposed to her sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">who is greatly hated because of her heartless, ignorant, and barbaric nature in the show, especially towards the former</a>.
</li><li> Scarlett is probably universally disliked in the show after the events of "Scarlett Fever", but she gained a lot of fans both before and after that incident in real life.
</li><li> Max is another perfect example, as he's arguably the most hated character since Heather, yet has quite a sizable fan base (despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a>).
</li><li> The Ice Dancers from <em>The Ridonculous Race</em> were the villains of that show/season, and became hated by every other team for their cheating and backstabbing throughout the series. These traits also made them the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">most entertaining to watch</a>.
</li><li> The Goths regularly freaked out the other teams with their dour personalities, but they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">decent people</a>, and the weird situations they got into made them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyIsCool">lot of fans</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>: Blitzwing alternates between an aloof <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">psycho</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, and even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys">partner Lugnut</a> can't stand him all the time. He's also one of the most popular characters in the show.
</li><li> If there was ever a poster boy for this trope, it'd be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em> own Dick Dastardly. Not only is he universally despised by all (even his own sidekick), but he never wins a single race despite having the fastest vehicle in the tournament (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">mostly due to a compulsive desire to cheat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">and every attempt always backfiring on him spectacularly</a>). And the one time he actually won a race by legitimate means (and by legitimate, we mean by the typical standards of this race), the judges called foul play and disqualified him, despite the same tactic being used by another racer who won. Regardless of these failures, Dick Dastardly is easily the most popular character in the fandom, to the extent that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">he</a> (and fellow contestant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop">Penelope Pitstop</a>) got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff">spinoffs</a>!
</li><li> Jack Spicer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>.

Following him is Raimundo, who has either a larger or equal number of fans, and is the butt of a lot of jokes within the show (not as much as Jack).
