By the end of the episode, they discover that the supposed supernatural activity or monster activity is nothing but an elaborate hoax taking advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouseHistorian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouseHistorian">local lore</a> to frighten off the curious from discovering and interfering with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">main criminal activity.</a> Or just to mess with people. Locals are typically too scared to take a closer look, and if the police aren't fooled themselves, they've already written off the whole thing as a juvenile prank not worth their time. Thus, it's up to those intrepid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">meddling kids</a> to uncover the truth.
</p><p>In the old days, this apparently really worked. Smugglers and other criminals could scare away intruders by dressing as ghosts. Nowadays, however, this would be a really stupid ploy, as many alleged real life haunted houses and areas of "paranormal activity" are tourist attractions. The criminals wouldn't be able to move for New Agers, UFOlogists, people from shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostHunters">Ghost Hunters</a></em>, James Randi fans, and other rubberneckers. Plus, those local cops would probably be far more attentive about "strange goings-on at the old lumbermill" (though they're probably thinking 'meth lab' over 'costumed jewel thieves'.) On the other hand, the aversion - pretending that a place is haunted to attract public attention &amp; make money on "haunted" fame - tends to work <em>really</em> well.

It allows the creator to play with some mild horror tropes in children's entertainment without irritating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> or introducing the supernatural to a real-life setting. Sometimes the Hoax revolves around the application of one scientific fact or theatrical technique, for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">valuable educational lesson.</a>

Indeed, the investigators may discover the truth and haul the instigators off to jail, and the audience alone gets to see the unambiguous and real apparition. Or they may get to see the real thing along with the characters.
</p><p>This can be a real source of frustration to fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a>, who tend to be drawn to certain works specifically <em>because</em> of the paranormal elements.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> has a huge one in that the entire life of Sieglinde is constructed. She is first introduced as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">leader</a> of an obscure village in the heart of the German forest, where time seems to have stopped. Strange werewolves plague the area, and their breath causes illness and eventually, death. Sieglinde is put in the role of the 'Green Witch' to perform spells and heal them. In reality, every werewolf and villagers are military, or former military, and the 'Green Witch' is a constructed identity specifically for Sieglinde to continue the Sarin gas project.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em>:
<ul><li> When this trope is played out, the real surprise was that in the end, in addition to the kids playing pranks, there was an actual ghost. It was a mostly harmless one, though.
</li><li> Another episode features a different variation. An irreverent chef comes to judge Chef Kawasaki's cooking skills, but it turns out he was in a costume and working for N.M.E. What's under the costume was worse.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one anime episode, the heroes got reports of a huge, aquatic monster living on a chain of lakes near from Mount Fuji. When Kouji went to investigate to the site, a witch appeared all of sudden and warned him the lake monster would curse him if he did not leave. That woman had been scaring away whoever came to investigate the monster sightings. It did not take long for Kouji to discover that witch was Baron Ashura, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Hell</a>s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">second-in-command</a>, in disguise and the monster was a Mechanical Beast. Baron Ashura was using the curse hoax to hide their activities (mining the lakebed for uranium to fabricate nuclear bombs).
</li><li> In one manga chapter, Kouji and his friends go to a hot springs resort. However, the area is apparently being haunted by ghosts. Boss is terrified but Kouji does not believe one word of it, so he and Sayaka set to investigate what is happening. Quickly they discover the ghosts in reality are androids commanded by Count Brocken, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a> of Dr. Hell.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MazingerAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MazingerAngels">Mazinger Angels</a></em> reimagines the chapter described above. This time, Count Broken used the hoax to drive the other hot spring resorts out of business in order to make tourists flock to his Third Reich Hotel where they would be subsequently enslaved and forced to mine for gold in the caves located under the building.
</li></ul></li><li> At least one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> / <em>Case Closed</em> did this. The protagonists receive a letter from a dead man and investigate a series of murders framed on his ghost. In the end, it turned out to be his son who was supposedly killed along with him, posing as a woman, seeking revenge for the death of his father.
<ul><li> There are multiple 'supernatural monster' episodes, too. Since the series is set in its version of a strictly rational world, <em>any</em> invocation of the supernatural can be assumed to be a Scooby Doo Hoax. (That doesn't stop normally-stalwart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> Ran from cowering whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">she suspects she may be up against ghosts</a>, however.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of Kindachi's cases involve murderers who disguise themselves as a feared monster from local folklore, and kill their victims in ways relating to the legends surrounding that figure (eg, a killer disguised as a legendary headless samurai ghost decapitates all his victims.) Kindaichi gathers clues leading up to a dramatic unmasking of the "monster" at the end of the story. Different from your standard Scooby hoax in that most characters understand from the get-go that this isn't a real monster, just a psycho in a disguise. Inverted in that this arguably makes it <em>more</em> scary...
</li><li> There's always one character who really believes that the killer is actually the legendary monster in question. That person almost always ends up dead, and his/her death leaves everyone else with eerie, lingering doubts about the killer's humanity.
</li><li> Except in one story where the person who believed in the monster was actually the killer.
</li><li> There are also a couple instances where the monster might be real, but have nothing to do with the murders. After all, the myth had to come from SOMETHING.
</li></ul></li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em>, it's established that the school has an abandoned storehouse, which Avril claims is haunted by the ghost of a former student. It later turns out "Avril" is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief">Phantom Thief</a> named Kuiaran the Second, who has been posing as a student as part of a heist. The "ghost" that was making strange thumping and moaning noises? That was the <em>real</em> Avril, who had been left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> inside the storehouse after Kuiaran stole her identity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em> does this repeatedly, most notably in Kamikakushi Village. The arc with the seances takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">rather unusual</a> angle on the trope.
</li><li> During the Thriller Bark arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the supernatural things like cerberii, ghosts and zombies are later revealed to be the work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Gekko Moria</a> and his crew, all of them Devil Fruit users. A single panel at the end hints that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">there might have been something spooky haunting the place before Moria showed up</a>, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">left ambiguous</a>.
</li><li> Rather confusingly subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. The heroes and Team Rocket encounter a festival at which the ghost of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">heartbroken maiden</a> is believed to possess young men. After James and Brock are affected, they discover that the true culprit is a Gastly (a Ghost Pokemon, which apparently doesn't count). However, towards the end of the episode it is revealed to the viewers that there is indeed a true ghost of the maiden, and the Gastly is keeping the legend alive out of respect for her (and to make a few bucks).
</li><li> In the Scooby-Doo-themed episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitanJuniorHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitanJuniorHigh">Attack on Titan: Junior High</a></em>, the 1<sup>st</sup> years participated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kimodameshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kimodameshi">57th Test of Courage</a> to search for the "Wonders of Titan Junior High", only to realize that the ghosts that haunt the school are actually the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> years pulling the strings.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em>, the gang investigates an allegedly haunted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedHospital">Abandoned Hospital</a>, gradually dismantling its various scares and discovering that they were perpetrated by a group of local kids, who thus tried to protect a meek homeless man who made an abandoned ward his home. But when they meet him, he reveals them that there <em>is</em> one real ghost there, that of an old lady who died in a fire years ago (whom Kaname has actually glimpsed before), sending the whole group, including the kids, running for their lives. And <em>then</em> it is revealed, that the "ghost" is actually the guy's elderly mother, whose presence he hid even from the kids who were helping him.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></em>, the hero comes to a tavern that borders a haunted woods. Once there, Usagi is forced to take a dare to explore the woods for an item there. In the woods, Usagi has a terrifying experience facing many of the monsters he has faced before and slashes out wildly before discovering that they are all elaborate puppets and he catches the puppeteers in this hoax. However, when he learns that the hoax, which is basically harmless, is helping their poor village prosper, he agrees to play along while allowed to get the quest object to win his wager.
</li><li> The original purpose of the comic-book character Dr. Thirteen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> was to debunk supernatural sightings. When he was integrated with the rest of the characters in a shared universe, this naturally led to some problems as the supernatural <em>does</em> exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. This was largely "solved" by making Dr. Thirteen a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, but it's not all bad news for him. Apparently, his skepticism means he's somewhat resistant to magical effects (in the DCU, you have to genuinely believe in the supernatural before it will work for you) and he can and does provide alternate scientific theories that sometimes turn out to be right. Anyway, writers <em>love</em> to put poor Terry in situations where he ends up delivering a full-on rant about the supernatural not existing to, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger">The Phantom Stranger</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the comic "The Old Castle's Secret," the ghost of Sir Quackly McDuck turns out to be a jewel thief using "invisibility spray". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> commented that he wanted to do a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedCastle">Haunted Castle</a>" story but at that time including "real" supernatural events such as ghosts in a Disney comic was strictly taboo.
</li><li> Another Carl Barks example comes from the story "Terror of the River", where Donald and his nephews investigate a giant serpent-monster terrorizing a waterway. The "monster" turns out a realistic inflatable model controlled by a guy in a submarine. As opposed to some of the other examples on this page, the perp has no ulterior motive — he is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">likes scaring people for the heck of it.</a>
</li><li> Less notable <em>Donald Duck</em> and <em>Mickey Mouse</em> stories have done this over and over again in various forms. An inverted version where the heroes scare away the villains from something being protected is about as common. The twist where some of it is shown to be real after all appears frequently in both versions. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">story-within-a-story</a>, written by Goofy, was a parody; in the end, the answer to how the villain was able to create the appearance of all those supernatural monsters is explained by saying that, well, he was a magician, and magicians do all kinds of tricks we can't explain, so why should the story do that?

It was thus full of this sort of hoax (sometimes with fake supernatural creatures that are real murderers) as well as monsters created by science, ordinary killers with horror themes, etc.

</li><li> Some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> had variants of this trope:
<ul><li> The novel <em>Mr. Monk on Patrol</em> has Monk and Natalie initially bunked at a hotel that is supposedly haunted. And during their first night in Summit, New Jersey, the ghost tries to attack Natalie, but Natalie fights back and the person playing the ghost manages to escape, then is caught by police. It turns out Monk had found some details while unpacking in his room that he thought were suspicious, and this led him to more clues that told him how the "ghost" story was fabricated.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the UFO" had a variant: Monk and Natalie are driving in the country when their car breaks down in a small Nevada town. While Monk is trying to get a cell phone signal, he sees a small UFO fly overhead. It hovers for a few seconds over them, then flies away. The next day, Monk files a report with the sheriff. The next night, Monk, Natalie and a hotel manager see the UFO.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Voodoo Curse" is probably one of the top examples. Two random people are killed in freak accidents (an elderly power walker who gets hit by a baseball knocked over a fence, and a guy killed by lightning while golfing in a thunderstorm), and when people go to their apartments to pack their stuff up, they find voodoo dolls that are dated a few days before the recipient's death. Monk is brought in to investigate, due to the case being considered weird right away by Stottlemeyer and Disher, but even he is baffled by the circumstances. Shortly after he takes the case, a third doll victim occurs - the wealthy founder of an electronics company - and it is the first one to have a body; who died of an apparent heart attack. Then Natalie, who is afraid of voodoo, receives a doll in the mail that warns her she will be decapitated. Monk eventually finds that Angeline Dilworth, a paramedic and niece of the third victim, was responible for sending the dolls and was trying to cover up the death of her uncle, the only one of the three victims to actually be a murder. The other two victims were the freak accidents they were supposed to be, and Angeline had been the EMT who responded to both calls. She had stolen each accident victim's house key and used that to break into the respective victim's house to plant a customized voodoo doll.

Others were seemingly taken as well going back to the 1970s. When the woman appears, she's suddenly able to walk after a few years in a wheelchair. The detectives are thrown by sights of lights and what looks like a hazmat team digging up a place. Eventually, the truth is even wilder: All the abductees had done work at the vineyard of a local millionaire, unaware they were being exposed to an illegal pesticide that made them sick. He'd buried the evidence on land that was about to be developed. The man knew that once folks figured out what happened, he'd be facing a monster of a lawsuit. So, he used the old UFO stories to fake the abductions to cover them being treated by a doctor for the "miracle cures."

</li><li> Also zig-zagged in the episode "Haunted House Hang-Up". The heroes spend the episode chasing (and being chased by) one monster, who turns out to just be a man who dressed up to protect his own property from would-be thieves. The real criminal, who is indeed after the treasure the owner is protecting, is unmasked at the end.

<ul><li> According to Parisian legend, during the thirteenth century, there was a derelict castle south of the city at a place called Vauvert, near the modern Luxembourg Gardens, which was said to be haunted by sinister lights and sounds. King Louis IX offered the property to a group of Carthusian monks if they were willing to exorcise it. When the monks moved in to the castle, however, they discovered evidence that it had been used as a hideout by a gang of criminals, who had faked the haunting to scare people away. (The king let them keep it anyway.)
</li><li> Paranormal investigators and parapsychics are, after long experience, open to the possibility that in some cases they might be manipulated for financial ends. One British ghost-hunter, called to investigate an alleged haunting at a country hotel, spent a month looking and mounting vigil, on and off over the course of a year. When he finally said to the owner that he was almost absolutely certain nothing was there, the hotel owner begged him to make something up and fabricate a ghost, as it would be so good for business to be able to advertise his business as a haunted hotel. The same ghost hunter noted, some time later, the hotel was advertising itself as "having repeatedly been investigated by psychic detectives and ghost-hunters".... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes">Fortean Times</a></em> finds the Scooby-Doo Hoax to be a whole interesting Fortean area of its own.
</li><li> In a criminal-vs-criminal example, there's a possibly-apocryphal account of a body snatcher from Victorian Edinburgh using this trope on some rival "resurrection men". Dressed up in a winding cloth, he sneaked up on them as they were hauling a fresh corpse from its grave, then moaned eerily and waved his arms. The "apparition" scared his competitors so badly that they fled into the night, leaving their equipment and gruesome prize behind. The "ghost" laughed for a while, then swiped their shovels and hauled the body away himself to sell to a medical school.
</li><li> Some cattle rustlers have been found attaching lights and speakers to their trucks to imitate UFOs to scare away ranchers who come snooping around.
</li><li> The Scooby-Doo type hoax was successfully weaponized by CIA operative Edward Lansdale against Huk insurgency in the Philippines. Utilizing the local population's superstitious fear of vampires, government troopers quietly abducted the rebel troopers at night, drain their blood and left bloodless corpses with "fang marks" to be found. Since the "vampire" activity was strictly limited to rebel areas of operation, this action seriously decreased the local population's support for insurgents, and in some cases forced the rebels to flee in fear.
