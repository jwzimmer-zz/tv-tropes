The human trafficker who took on the identity of Martin Li is the one who was born, but that's besides the point.

Three beautiful witches that Dagar becomes involved with visit Magg-Deth with a prophecy about how only an entire nation can slay him, and only after that nation has entered the Dark Fortress that the warlord calls home. But as Dagar reveals during the final showdown with him, he is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">sole survivor of the nation of Tulgonia</a>, which makes him an entire nation. Needless to say, Magg-Deth dies by Dagar's blade soon after.

However, when Immortus reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpearOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpearOfDestiny">The Spear of Destiny</a> prevents anyone born of woman from defeating him, Eternity can't think who to summon - "Even Hercules and Gilgamesh had mothers!"

Anathos states they can't defeat him because only a God can kill another God, thus him committing suicide would be the only option (as at this point no other God is around). He ends up being stabbed by Jadina with Danael's sword, which was forged with Danael's blood and as such counts as part of his body.
</li><li> The first story from the very first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a></em> uses this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> encounters an old high school friend of his named Margo Griffiths; back when they were teens she was told by a fortune teller that "Margo Griffiths will cease to exist," on her 21st birthday. All his other predictions wound up coming true, and with her 21st birthday coming up she's scared out of her mind. Superman is able to help her out of her funk by convincing her to marry her fiance. As the two are wed, he tells her "You don't have to worry about anything happening to Margo Griffiths anymore  you're Margo <em>Vaughn</em> now!"
</li><li> An indie comic called <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pixy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pixy">Pixy</a></em> tells the story of a couple who has an abortion  the titular Pixy  who likes to call them up from the afterlife when drunk. On a road trip with his dad, Pixy happens upon the source of all life and information in the world: The Holy Hot Dog Stand, He Who Writes on the Milk Cartons, and extorts Him for candy with a bazooka. The Holy Hot Dog Stand, He Who Writes on the Milk Cartons says, "I'm the almighty, no one of woman born can harm me." Then guess what happens.

<ul><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Facilier convinces Naveen to make use of his services by saying "Naveen needs green" in order to fix his life issues. Naveen is broke at that point, and "green" is used by Facilier as if it means "money". But Facilier's spell, instead of giving Naveen money, turns him into a frog; technically, Facilier did what he promised, as Naveen now <em>does</em> have more green in his life, but Facilier sure did <em>not</em> do this to help Naveen, but to get rid of him. This first seems to be an awful situation for Frog!Naveen, but him being turned into a frog is what makes him ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">happily married to Tiana and living a new, better life in New Orleans at Tiana's new restaurant</span>. So Facilier's words "you need more green in your life" actually <em>were</em> completely true for Naveen (as the green <em>did</em> fix his life), but unintentionally on Facilier's part, as when he spoke them, he intended them as a lie.
</li><li> Prince Naveen, turned into a frog, can only be freed of his curse when he kisses a princess, which is not <em>impossible</em>, but princesses are rather difficult to come across in New Orleans. Any non-princesses he kisses (like the female lead, Tiana) get turned into frogs as well. Of course, it then turns out that <em>any</em> princess will do. The daughter of the person elected King of a Mardi Gras parade counts, even though she has no royal blood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It doesn't work out because the parade ends before she can kiss him. Naveen and Tiana decide to get married as frogs. As the wife of a prince, she's now a princess  meaning her kiss turns them both back to normal.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletProofMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletProofMonk">Bullet Proof Monk</a></em> features a trio of prophecies that determine the one most worthy to protect a scroll that grants great power. These prophecies, performed off-screen by the nameless monk protagonist at the movie's beginning, are defeating an army of enemies while a flock of cranes circled overhead, fighting for love in the palace of jade, and saving his brothers whom he did not know. Later in the film, the monk watches while the other protagonist, Kar, performs modern-day versions of these prophecies. Fighting a street gang under a circle of <em>mechanical</em> cranes. Fighting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, Jade, in her mansion. Finally, he saves several of the monks' brothers from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">real kicker</a>, however, is that Jade <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also performed all three, as shown during the flashback when Monk was explaining it. She lured away Funktastic and his crew after Kar beat his ass (then dropped his weapon). She equated love and respect while defending her lifestyle in her own house. And she was the one who rescued the monks, while Kar was fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> with Monk.</span> Thus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>both</em> of them</span> become the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scroll's next guardians</span>. Mind you, this twist requires <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the prophecy knows that in English, "crane" can mean either a bird or a lifting vehicle. It's magic after all... although possibly not <em>too</em> much, as the mechanical hauling devices were <em>named for</em> their cursory resemblance to the bird.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em>, "no weapon forged by man" can hurt Mordred. He's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed by Excalibur</span>. Mother Nature would like to add that a large icicle, rock, tree branch, or angry boar passes the test, so this prophecy is less difficult to get around than one would think (however, all of these aren't exactly an advantage when fighting a good swordsman). Additionally, there's also poison, slings, non-metal arrows, garrote wires, fire, fisticuffs, starvation...
</li><li> Not fully impossible, but close. In a German film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HauntedMill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HauntedMill">Haunted Mill</a></em>, said mill is haunted by evil ghosts who can only be destroyed by "snow in the summer".

One story he tells involves Abraham Lincoln suddenly appearing out of nowhere, which is later fulfilled by a Lincoln penny dropping off of a bridge he's standing under. Another, which involves him being set on fire, comes true when he is "fired" from his job.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King</a></em>, Cassandra tells Memnon that Mathayus cannot die by his hand or any other hand he commands. Memnon gets around this by burying Mathayus up to his neck in sand and leaving him to be devoured by hungry fire ants, although Mathayus manages to escape.
</li><li> In the Russian Disney film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBookOfMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBookOfMasters">The Book Of Masters</a></em> film, the golem army of ardars will serve Countess of Stones until "the stone cries and human pities the stone". But Countess herself counts as creature of stone too, even after her soul is restored, and she herself fulfills the prophecy by crying and being pitied in the end. The twist is that ardars don't turn on her after it, they're just free, and still decide to follow her.

Steve tells her that they can't help them — after all, the place got its name because <em>no man</em> could ever cross it. But Diana is no man... Cue one of the most awesome moments in the entire movie: Diana being the first person to cross No Man's Land, armed only with her bulletproof bracelets and her shield.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Folklore </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There is a Russian story about some lad who is stuck in a foreign land until his new boots (received at entrance) are gone, but they cannot be worn out, burned, or thrown away. The lad gets rid of them by feeding them to the host.
</li><li> French folklore is full of tales about canny peasants outwitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> at his own game, essentially through the use of this trope.
<ul><li> For example, one story tells of a peasant who, in the middle of the worst famine the country's ever seen, asked the Devil to make his lands rich and fertile for one year. The Devil agrees, on the condition that he gets everything that's above the ground, but the peasant plants carrots. Furious, the Devil comes back and says he'll make the land fertile for one more year, on the condition that he gets everything grown below the ground. Of course, this time the peasant plants corn. Fed up, the devil agrees to a final deal: he'll make things grow miraculously, but at the end of the year he gets everything above the ground AND everything under it. So the peasant plants trees and hunts in the forest...
<ul><li> There's a similar story in black American folklore about a black sharecropper and a white landowner. The landowner promises to give the sharecropper the bottom half of the crop, assuming he will plant cotton. The sharecropper plants potatoes. The next year the landowner asks for the top half, and he plants carrots. The third year, he asks for the top and bottom parts of the crop, and the sharecropper plants corn, so the landowner only gets the tassels above and the stalks below, and the corn in the middle is for the sharecropper.
</li></ul></li><li> In Quebec, a similar tale involves a bet between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Archangel Michael</a> and Satan, where the farmers of Quebec and their crops are the object of the bet.
</li><li> Another example has the devil appearing in a town and challenging the inhabitants to bring him a clock he cannot fix. No matter the state of the clocks they bring, the devil is able to fix them, even making missing parts appear out of thin air. Finally, one person brings him a clock that works perfectly, which means there is nothing for the devil to fix.
</li></ul></li><li> Ireland has one that reads like something out of the mind of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a></em>. In it, a woman sells her soul in exchange for a flourishing family farm. When the Devil comes to collect, she gives him <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">the sole of her shoe</a></em>. Because it was a verbal contract, the devil couldn't contest it.
</li><li> A high number of stories that involve selling souls to the Devil in exchange for work invoke this.
<ul><li> In an example from French folklore, the Devil builds for a town an indestructible bridge in one night across a river that destroyed all previous bridges, in exchange for the soul of the first one to walk on it. Naturally, the mayor makes his dog pass first, since, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>, dogs have no soul.
</li><li> Devil's Bridge in Kirkby Lonsdale, England. Legend holds that the Devil appeared to an old woman, promising to build a bridge in exchange for the first soul to cross over it. When the bridge was finished the woman threw bread over the bridge and her dog chased after it, thereby outwitting the Devil.
</li><li> There are several similar legends all over the place, for instance also about the building of the chapel palatine (now cathedral) of Aachen. Here they chased a she-wolf inside when it was finished.
</li><li> And in Quebec just about any bridge or church has at least even odds of invoking a similar legend - either an animal crosses first, or the Devil specifies in the contract "First soul to enter the completed church" and the priest decides that he can make do with a church that's missing just the one stone.
<ul><li> Another variant is that the devil (or some trolls) has to complete the work before the rooster crows. Cue waking the rooster just before the last stone is set in place.
</li></ul></li><li> When trying to build a bridge over the Schöllenen Gorge in Switzerland, the locals are said to have failed so often that they called for the Devil to build their bridge, and he did so in exchange for the soul of who passes the bridge first. They sent him a billy goat.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a popular historical legend (though very little evidence) that the Christian clergy was prohibited shedding blood (<em>sine effusione sanguinis</em>), so during the troubled times of the Middle Ages, the spears and swords were a no-no, even for self-defense. Nothing is said about staves and blunt weapons (such as maces), though...
</li><li> There's an Irish story in which a farmer sells his soul to the Devil for enough money to send his three sons to school as a doctor, a priest, and a lawyer. Come the end of his life, the Devil shows up to collect, and the farmer begs for just one more day to say goodbye to his sons. The Devil agrees, and the doctor arrives to send his father off but begs just one more hour for his brother. The priest comes in and begs another hour, but come the third son the Devil says no more hours, so the lawyer asks him to refrain from taking his father's soul until the candle stub in the corner burns all the way down. When the Devil agrees, the lawyer blows the candle out and pockets it.
</li><li> There's a widespread fairy tale ("Clever Greta" is one title) in which a ruler is determined to throw a man into prison for some reason. However, he will let the man off if his famously clever daughter can show up "neither clothed nor naked, neither walking nor riding, not on the road but not off it, and bearing a gift that is not a gift". The exact terms vary. The answer to this version is: wrapped in a fishing net, one leg thrown over the back of a goat that is walking in a huge rut, with a fly in a basket that flies away as soon as the lid is taken off. Some versions add that the ruler is so impressed that he marries her. She uses her wits to help someone challenge one of his verdicts, so he kicks her out in a rage, saying that she can take whatever she likes most from his palace, but it's over. She hosts a farewell dinner in her chambers, then leaves in the carriage with a fat roll of carpet. The ruler wakes up the next morning, hungover, in her father's farmhouse. Well, he <em>said</em> she could take what was most precious! Charmed, he forgives her and takes her back.
</li><li> The ancient Aztecs had a prophecy stating that their greatest capital would be built at a place where an eagle was sitting on a cactus and holding a snake in its mouth — possible things, but looking for it would be like a needle in a haystack. Eventually, they finally found it, and it became the site of Tenochtitlan. The Mexican flag has a picture of this on it. One tiny snag though — <em>it happened on a rock in the middle of a lake.</em> So they built their new city, Tenochtitlan, on the lake. (When the Spanish showed up 200 years later, they recognized the value of the city but didn't care for all the water. They drained the lake bit by bit, creating Mexico City.)
</li><li> There is a legend that Seleucus I Nicator was warned by the oracle to avoid Argos. He avoided all cities with that name. However, he failed to avoid every single <em>altar</em> with that name...
</li><li> The Roman Emperor Domitian believed a prophecy that said he would die at noon on a certain day. On that day, he locked himself in his room with a servant and allowed no one to enter. He asked the servant several times what time it was (Roman hours depended on sunrise and sunset, so it could be difficult to tell), but the servant lied and said it was past the hour he was fated to die. Relieved, Domitian allowed other people in the room. One of them was the assassin who killed him, almost precisely at noon.
</li><li> Confederate Brigadier Micah Jenkins survived several brushes with death after proudly proclaiming he could not be killed by Yankee bullets. Ultimately, he's killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireIndex">Confederate fire.</a>

To add to its formidable military defenses, it was also subject to a prophecy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"Gawilghur shall never fall to any army of India".</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj">Then the British</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">arrived...</a>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brazil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brazil">Brazilian</a> War Of Canudos, this seemed to be a recurring thing. Mystic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Conselheiro</a> said there would be four fires, and that he guaranteed that they'd survive at least three. Sure enough, the village was destroyed by the <em>fourth</em> army siege. When the army besieged the city of Canudos for the second time, the Colonel in charge was said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a> with the exception of a bullet made out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeOfNewt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeOfNewt">goat's horn</a>. When he died, it was discovered that a bullet made out of a goat's horn killed him.
</li><li> King Henry IV of England was told by a psychic that he would "die in Jerusalem", so he refused to go on any crusades. Then, while taking communion in Westminster Abbey, he had a massive heart attack. He was carried into one of the side chapels, known as "the Jerusalem Room"; he revived briefly and asked where he was; told "The Jerusalem Room", he cried out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">"Jerusalem? Noooooo......",</a> and died.
<ul><li> A similar legend is told about Pope Silvester II (999-1003) who was reputed to have had a pact with a female demon called Meridiana, with whose help he managed to ascend to the papal throne. According to the legend, Meridiana told Silvester that if he should ever read a mass in Jerusalem, the Devil would come for him. The pope then cancelled a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but when he read mass in the church Santa Croce in Gerusalemme ("Holy Cross of Jerusalem") in Rome, he became sick soon afterwards and died.
</li></ul></li><li> Legend has it that Queen Catherine de Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, once received a prediction that she would die "next to Saint-Germain". During fifteen years, she did her best to keep away from the numerous castles, cities, and parishes bearing this name. She eventually got sick with a pleurisy so bad a confessor was called in. His name: Julien de Saint-Germain.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a></em> novels:
<ul><li> The sorcerer Nevyn did some selfish things which resulted in his fiancée killing herself. When he learns that she will be reincarnated, he rashly swears "never to rest" until he has made restitution. It takes him 450 years to fulfill his promise, during which time she is reincarnated seven times. Nevyn's name literally translates to "no one" and this is played on several times. Including once when a guard tells Nevyn his lord will see no one. "Well then, tell him No One is here to see him!"
</li><li> In <em>Daggerspell</em>, there is a prophecy concerning the villainous lord Corbyn. "He shall not die in battle except by the sword, and no man's hand can slay him." He is eventually slain by a seventeen-year-old girl.
</li><li> After it was discovered that the leader of the warband coming after Corbyn was (unknowingly) a half-elf, the sorcerer Nevyn pointed out that he would have qualified as well - but he'd never have succeeded unless he knew that he qualified. It's implied that there is a psychological component to the protection. The real key is that his father took away his original name, and said he would be "No one" which in turn shows up in more than a few prophecies and omens - significant, because he was actually a prince of the realm and a son of the king, although he was a younger son which makes this a bitter play on his position as a useless son (neither heir to the throne nor the back-up to the heir to the throne) even before he became a literal no one. Lampshaded by himself many years later, when the country is in danger of being torn apart because of a succession crisis. It's a bitter irony that the person who technically has the strongest claim to the throne is the nobody herbman who, by virtue of the reasons for his impossible lifespan, would also be an impossible choice for the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> Given the overwhelming influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em>, it's no surprise that one of Ahab's crew members makes a similar prophecy concerning Ahab's death.
<ul><li> There's <em>several</em> in <em>Moby-Dick</em>, all by Fedallah, but the one that sticks out most poignantly is him saying, "I go before thee, my captain." No, Ahab, that doesn't mean you're invincible while Fedallah's alive, it just means he'll die before you.
</li><li> Another is that Ahab can only be killed by hemp. He assumes this means he will only die if he is hanged. Not, say, that he should be careful around rope in general. And in fact, rope does him in, tying around him and dragging him under when the whale submerges.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> example is purposely referenced, complete with a similar prophecy, in E.

</li><li> In Russian fantasy novella "Jack the Mad King", the evil sorceress claims that "No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">one</a> can kill [her]". Yeah, sure. In the end, she was impaled with a sword, held simultaneously by the warrior, monk, and woman - since they did it together, neither of them counted as the one and only one to kill her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, a character is imprisoned "until the moon loses her daughter, if that occurs in a week when two Mondays come together".

<ul><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namers</a> (specifically, the "No Man" part): In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, the Witch-King of Angmar is the subject of a prophecy made by the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who foretold that he would not fall by the hand of man; naturally, he was slain by Éowyn, a woman who entered the battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">in disguise</a>, with the aid of Merry, a hobbit. This was intentionally based on <em>Macbeth</em>, whose prophecy Tolkien thought was cheating; the Ents (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">actual walking trees</a>) <a class="urllink" href="http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/bidthetree.htm">came from the same idea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Note how nicely Tolkien covers his bases here: Éowyn is a member of the race called Men, but is female, while Merry is a man of his own race but is a Hobbit, not a Man. And killing the Witch-King takes both of them. In old English, as in many Germanic languages, "man" was a cross-gender word originally. The entire scene can be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">pun</a> on the human female: Woman, derived from <em>wif-man</em> (literally wife-man, but more accurately translated as "woman-person"). Thus, one Norwegian translation uses the archaic expression "Kvinnmann", ("female man") which literally means the same thing.
</li><li> Of note, Glorfindel's prophecy is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> because he said "It is not by the hand of man" that the Witch-King <em>would</em> fall, implying that his death <em>was inevitable</em> in the future.

</li><li> Agamemnon couldn't be killed in his house or out of it, naked or clothed, feasting or fasting. He was killed in his bath house, covered with a net, while eating an apple.

When he asked how long his kingdom would last, he was told that when a mule was the king of the Medes it would not be shameful to flee. At the time the king of the Medes and the rest of Persia was Cyrus, who was half Mede and half Persian and therefore a mule. And the great empire that fell was Croesus' own.
</li><li> Later the emperor Nero experienced something similar. When the oracle told him (after insulting him for having his mother killed) that the number 73 would mark the hour of his downfall, he thought that he would have a long reign and die at the age of 73 (and burned the oracle alive for the insult). He was overthrown the next year when the 73-year old Galba rose up in rebellion.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a> just <em>loves</em> this trope. It's taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when Asura Hiranyakashipu obtains a boon from Brahma that made him unkillable by human, deva, or animal, during night or day, by anything animate or inanimate, on earth or space, inside or outside. He was slain by Vishnu's avatar Narasimha, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalBeing">a demigod with a lion's head (the avatar's name means "Man-lion" - neither wholly human nor animal)</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiminalTime">at twilight (neither night nor day)</a>, by being disemboweled with Narasimha's claws (neither animate nor inanimate), and having his guts spilled into Narasimha's lap (neither earth nor space) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out). Vishnu also surprised the Asura by bursting out of a pillar in his own palace. That was not part of the prophecy; Vishnu is just that badass.
<ul><li> Also, in <em>Ramayana</em>, the rakshasa king Ravana asked Brahma for invulnerability to gods, spirits, and animals — but not humans, because he wasn't afraid of them and considered them beneath his notice. He was subsequently killed by Rama, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">human</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">avatar</a> of Vishnu.
</li><li> Perhaps the oldest version of "It is fated that no man can kill me so I got killed by a woman" (older than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> version) is the Hindu myth of Mahishasura and Durga. Mahishasura received a boon from Brahma that stated that he could not be defeated by any man or god, including Brahma himself. After defeating the great trinity (Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu), it would seem that no one could defeat him until, of course, the three of them sent their "divine feminine force" to Shiva's wife, Parvati, transforming her into the badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">Action Mom</a> (it is stated that she is very beautiful) Durga. Needless to say, being a woman and being so badass, she easily defeats Mahishasura.
<ul><li> Also involving her is the Hindu myth of the battle with the asura Raktabija, who received a boon that any blood spilled by him would become another copy of himself. After defeating the trinity (again), he fought Durga. When she was unable to kill him, her rage spawned her into becoming Kali, the even more badass version of herself. After drinking all of Raktabija's blood, therefore spilling none, she went into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">crazy frenzy</a> and began a dance so powerful it threatened to split the earth itself apart. She calmed down only when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTHeMoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTHeMoralityPet">she accidentally stepped on her husband</a>, Shiva, and wounded him. Realizing what she had done to her love, Kali bit her tongue in shame and quelled her fury.
</li><li> In another version, Kali instead strangles Raktabija, killing him without spilling any blood.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A Polish legend tells of a nobleman called Twardowski:
<ul><li> Twardowski made a deal with the devil to gain magical skills. In exchange, the devil had agreed for Twardowski to give over his soul when he visits Rome. Of course, for many years afterwards, Twardowski didn't even get close to Rome. His career ended, though, when he visited a certain inn: the devil then popped up and pointed out that the inn was called... guess what.
</li><li> A followup legend (and poem) has Twardowski tricking the devil into three last demands. The last one is for the devil to live with Twardowski's wife after he's taken to Hell for a year. The devil high-tails it.
</li><li> In another version, his initial wish was to visit the Moon but forgot it due to all the other great places the devil took him. However, when the devil was about to take his soul, he reminded him of the original wish, and since the Moon is a heavenly body, denied of demonic creatures, the devil was forced to break the bargain. The man still ended up on the Moon, somehow, and apparently became immortal in the process.
</li><li> Alternately, as he's being dragged down to Hell, Twardowski remembers a song about the Virgin Mary his mother used to sing to him. He sings the song and the Devil has to let go due to the holiness of the song. God then puts Twardowski on the moon because even though he used this deal with the Devil to do good things for people, he still sold his soul and can't get into Heaven.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, Baldr and his mother Frigg had dreams of his death which they took as prophetic. Frigg, in a display of motherly concern, extracted promises from just about everything on earth that they would not harm him (Baldr was pretty popular). However, she neglected to ask mistletoe, either considering it too young or too non-threatening to pose a threat. Then all the gods thought it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">terribly clever</a> to have fun throwing things at Baldr that would normally kill him but now wouldn't. Loki, being a complete bastard, made a spear out of mistletoe, gave it to <em>Baldr's blind brother</em> and had him kill Baldr with it. Then all the gods went to the underworld, and asked Hel, goddess of the Underworld, to let him come back to life. She said that she would do it only if they could get literally every living thing on the planet to say that they wanted him back. So they go around and eventually get everyone except for one person to agree. They go to this person, who is actually Loki in disguise, and ask him. And Loki tells them to fuck off. So they don't get Baldr back.
<ul><li> Another one occurred back when Loki was still favored by the other Norse Gods. The story goes that Loki was mouthing off about how the Sons of Ivaldi were great craftsmen and that the other dwarves could not create anything beautiful or useful. A Dwarf by the name of Brokkr, who was in Aasgard at the time, declared that his brother Eitri could indeed do better and had bet his head as part of the wager. Loki agreed to the bet and needless to say lost. When Brokkr came to collect on his wager, Loki weaseled out of it by saying that if Brokkr took his head, he'd also damage his neck, which was not part of their wager. However, Brokkr would have the last laugh by sewing Loki's lips shut.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a story about the siege of Troy in which it was prophesied that the first Greek to land on Troy's beach would be killed. Odysseus solves that problem by tossing out a shield and jumping on that instead, tricking other men to jump behind him.

Thoth, God of Wisdom, later tricked him into gambling away a small amount of his sunlight every day, until, by the end of the year, Thoth had saved up enough light to add five days to the calendar. Nut bore Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nepthys on four of these five days. Isis would go on to learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">Ra's true name, essentially gaining total power over him</a>

He granted it, and Caenis changed her name to Caeneus. Poseidon was in such a good mood that he made Caeneus invulnerable to weapons. Caeneus became a mighty warrior who seemingly couldn't be harmed, but was eventually killed when the centaurs crushed him under a pile of logs and boulders.

Cue the laughter of <a class="urllink" href="http://wow.gamepedia.com/Bwonsamdi">Bwonsamdi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a powerful spirit of the dead... <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bz9f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bz9f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bz9f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Oddly, due to either an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> or a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, neither Death Knights nor the Forsaken can breach the barrier, despite being undead and thus not living things.</span>

Notably, all indications are that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cesare</span> was just delusional, and Ezio did this just to troll him.
<ul><li> Ezio would lampshade this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">sequel</a> when disguised as a minstrel with these little ditties:

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, the quest "Recruitment Drive" involves having to beat an enemy who cannot be harmed by any man. If you're playing as a woman, no problem. If you're playing as a man, the Makeover Mage just outside of town will turn you into a woman for a small fee, and the quest rewards include reimbursement for that and the change back.
</li><li> In the <em>Hearts of Stone</em> expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em> the player winds up luring Olgierd to a moon-goddess' temple, to stand on a giant mosaic of the moon and fulfill the final part of his contract with O'Dimm (effectively, the devil) that they would meet on the moon. The player can then choose to stand by as Olgierd's soul is taken, or stake their own soul in a riddling game.

When he stumbles before Sothis, she quips "Too many swordsman, are there?", then asks what he intends to do. When Byleth is seen again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">they become a swords</a><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">woman</a></strong>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheHeroesOfMiddlecenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheHeroesOfMiddlecenter">The Heroes Of Middlecenter</a></em>, the evil Lord Baltimore parodies the Witch-King as such:
<div class="indent"><strong>Baltimore:</strong> Well heroes, I'm impressed that you've made it this far. But all for naught! For you see, no mortal man — <br/><strong>Kiki and Darklight:</strong> (who are female mages) Ahem! <br/><strong>Baltimore:</strong> — or woman... can strike me down!

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nodwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nodwick">Nodwick</a></em>, a scroll is known as "That Which Man Was Not Meant To Know" because reading it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">makes one's head explode</a>. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://comic.nodwick.com/?comic=2001-11-15">women<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can read it just fine, and find it ridiculous.

</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most of the spells used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> have escape clauses like this.
<ul><li> The first example in the series is actually a subversion: the spell that traps the gargoyles in stone stasis will not end "until the castle rises above the clouds," which seems primed for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">No Man of Woman Born</a> twist resolution. Instead, David Xanatos buys the whole thing, dismantles it, ships it to New York, and reassembles it at the top of a skyscraper tall enough to raise the castle <em>literally</em> above the clouds, in a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>.
</li><li> Nor is this the only time that he uses the application of modern technology and a lot of money to create a literal solution to a seemingly figurative problem. In "City of Stone" he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">enlists the gargoyles</a> to help him lace the sky above Manhattan with flammable gas and set it on fire in order to break Demona's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">spell</a>, which can only end "when the sky burns."
</li><li> Meanwhile, "The Price" presents a straight use of the trope when Xanatos obtains a magic cauldron with the power to make the person who bathes in it live "as long as the mountain stones." Which is true, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">for a certain value of "live"</a>. However, Xanatos and Owen were wise enough to suspect a twist. They were planning to test it on Hudson but he escaped, so Owen tests it with his fist, which emerges from the cauldron petrified.
</li><li> Due to magical meddling, neither Macbeth (a human) nor Demona (a gargoyle) can die unless they perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">Mutual Kill</a> on each other. While the correlation is never made explicit, this means that Macbeth cannot be killed by "one of woman born" because gargoyles hatch from eggs. Weisman has stated that this was the original reason for the pair's immortality but was scrapped for some reason (if memory serves, it was one of those "one more things that needs to be explained").
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> episode "Seer No Evil", the Rangers get a set of predictions from a gypsy moth named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Cassandra</a>. Chip's was the most elaborate, and the most ominous: "Before the next sun rises, Chip will follow a bear with two tails who will dance with a tiger. He will fall from a circle of light, and only a flying horse can save him. Finally, he will walk under an elephant, and the trunk will fall, and... *slashes throat* then, all is darkness!" As the Rangers investigate their next case, all the predictions start coming true, one by one. And just when Chip thinks he's avoided his fate by walking under an elephant, a <em>steamer</em> trunk lands on him. Luckily, he's saved by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a> when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByWallThatIsHoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByWallThatIsHoley">slips through a hole in the floor and so ends up underneath it</a>, where it is very dark. The throat-slashing gesture was made by a bad guy.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BikerMiceFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BikerMiceFromMars">Biker Mice from Mars</a></em>, a reality-shifting experiment resulted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> spoof:
<div class="indent">"Where is the one not born from a woman?" <br/>"My mother was a mouse!"
</div></li><li> In the animated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMummy">The Mummy</a></em>, Alex and his friend Yanit were faced with a challenge: A bridge that had many giant axes attached to pendulums swinging across them. An inscription near the bridge declared that "No man could pass alive." After confirming that that was exactly what it said, Yanit crosses the bridge without activating the traps and admits that "he" has been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a> the whole time.
</li><li> In Disney's <em>Ariel</em>, a curse of a werefish can be healed by "living silver." It turns out that silverfishes qualify.

Seconds later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Officer Renee Montoya, GCPD</a> shoots out their tires and arrests them both.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>, Heinrich's kidnapper Black John Licorice declares, "No man has ever out-sugared Black John Licorice!" Stickybeard smirks, "Now, who said anything about a man?" before revealing his challenger as Numbuh 5. It proves true anyways though; she doesn't out-sugar him, she just keeps the contest going long enough for the sun to rise and activate their curse.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> bank robber Femme Fatale robs the Townsville Bank of all its Susan B. Anthony coins. As she leaves, she boasts there is "not a man alive who can stop [her]." This cues the arrival of the Powerpuff <em>Girls</em>, and she clearly realizes she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">in trouble</a>.
</li><li> There's a variant in another episode: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">HIM</a> put the girls up to various challenges, including forcing them to "bring tears to the citizen's eyes", hoping they would do something bad enough it made them literally cry. They end up making it rain, which made it look like the citizens were crying (Blossom reasons this is "bringing tears to their eyes" instead of making tears come from them, and is technically what the challenge required; HIM accepts it).
