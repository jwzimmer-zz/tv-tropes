<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwelveBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwelveBeast">12 Beast</a></em>: Eita's biggest source of angst is his big brother Kouki. Eita's incredibly awesome and tends to excel with a little work at whatever he does. Kouki just happens to be a little older and better, and LOVES to use this to torture him. Anytime Eita takes on a sport, Kouki jumps in and does it better, and any time Eita tries to impress a girl Kouki jumps in and uses his awesomeness to seduce that girl for himself.
</li><li> Sayaka Saeki to Touko Nanami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>. Sayaka has always been second in their class, while Touko is first, and Touko ends up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> while having Sayaka as her vice president. Sayaka doesn't resent Touko for it — in fact, she falls in love with her because of that.
</li><li> Koujirou Hyuuga from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> is a very good player, but not good enough to beat Tsubasa. This is played for drama towards the final episodes of the original series, during the third Championship final match, which is all about Hyuuga doing everything possible to at last defeat Tsubasa. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the match ends on a draw and both teams are declared champions.</span>
</li><li> Dio from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins">Casshern Sins</a></em> sees himself as this to Casshern. And it irritates him to no end.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dio:</strong> We are perfectly identical, in both skills and specs! So explain to me why I'm inferior to Casshern!

<ul><li> Ayu Mitsuari feels resentment towards Misaki Shokuhou due to feeling that she is simply an inferior version of Misaki and that people will always compare her to Misaki, seeing her as nothing more than a cheap knockoff of Mental Out. What she doesn't know is that she and Misaki actually possesses near identical potentials, Ayu's simply not as powerful as Misaki due to the fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the researchers were sabotaging her development in order to keep her at a certain level, in case they ever needed a replacement for Misaki.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> After knowing she was seconded to NAGO in school again, Yanagin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em> dared NAGO to beat her in karate and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">ramen eating</a>...in which Yanagin was decisively defeated in both. In a later skit she tried daring NAGO to beat her in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tolerance in the sauna</span>, and defeated again — not only to NAGO, but presumably her two other friends Habara and Ikushima.
</li><li> Mello from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. He joins the mafia, kidnaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">poor little Sayu</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills Souichiro, kidnaps <em>Takada</em>, and gets his best friend killed</span> — all in the name of being better than Near at the "L's Successor" game. Meanwhile, Near feels the same way with L, only in the "Greatest-Detective" game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's been the story of Vegeta's life, ever since he met Gok- we mean, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">"Kakarot".</a> No matter how hard he tries, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">how much HARDER</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">he continues to push himself</a>, Goku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> is always several orders of magnitudes greater. Which endlessly frustrates the Saiyan Prince.
</li><li> Goku has this dynamic with all his rivals. Yamcha, Krillin, Tien, and Piccolo are always second to Goku even at their strongest, save when Piccolo briefly became the strongest hero after merging with Kami and Vegeta and Trunks also increased their power while he was subdued by the heart virus.
</li><li> Goten and Trunks have this relationship. Trunks is always a little stronger than Goten because of his age and being trained by his father. Goten isn't bitter about this, just mildly annoyed.
</li><li> Goten also has a mild case of this with Gohan. When training, he becomes upset at how easily Gohan can beat him.
</li><li> As of <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku is always second to Beerus, the strongest being in his universe if you don't count Whis</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a major part of Jinnai's motivation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El-Hazard: The Magnificent World</a></em> coupled with a side-order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a>. Makoto constantly and effortlessly doing better than him at every activity (at least at school), coupled with Makoto being the one to expose his bribing his way into the student council presidency, is what causes him to snap at the beginning. Though it's worth noting that he lead the Bugrom against the kingdoms of El-Hazard <em>before</em> finding out that Makoto was working with them. Makoto's participation just made it personal.
</li><li> In the earlier half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, the Deimon Devil Bats managed to beat weak teams like the Cupids or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">Chameleons,</a> but lost against strong teams like the White Knights, the Aliens, and at best tied with the Sphinx. (Technically winning because the Sphinx didn't want to fight the Aliens after such a hard battle anyway.) They got better as the series went on, but through out the series, you could never be so sure that they were going to win or not. Parodied with Saburo Mitsui, kicker for the Hakushu Dinosaurs who always tries to be <em>third</em> best at everything.
</li><li> Gaka Izumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlunkPunkRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlunkPunkRumble">Flunk Punk Rumble</a></em>. A formidable fighter/student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">on his own accord</a>, but it's practically a running gag that he's only second to Hana and Chiba at strength and academics, respectively.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">Omake</a> chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Mustang constantly suffered this to Edward in regards to the popularity polls. Whenever there was poll, Ed would always win, by a <em>large</em> landslide and Mustang would get pissed. The picture above was also the source of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>. Prior to the final popularity contest, Mustang was sure that he would come in first place because Ed and Al had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> during that period of the manga.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walter</span> is this to Alucard. During their final confrontation, Alucard even rubs it in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walter's face</span> by stating that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Anderson</a> couldn't defeat him, then a "brat" like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walter</span> never could. This blatantly implies that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Walter</span> wasn't even second best, but <em>third</em> best behind Anderson, who Alucard views as his true rival and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokosBasketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokosBasketball">Kuroko's Basketball</a></em>: As a collective group, the "Uncrowned Kings" are this in comparison to the "Generation of Miracles". Both groups are five extremely gifted basketball prodigies who have greater skills than any of their peers. The Generation, however, are as far beyond the Kings as the Kings are from everyone else. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> comes from the fact that if they had been born in any generation before now, THEY would be the Generation of Miracles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MakenKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MakenKi">Maken-ki!</a></em>: Poor Kinua. Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">her wealth, upbringing</a> and her beauty... she just can't compete with Azuki's natural athleticism. The the very first chapter establishes the fact by having Kinua <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangatown.com/manga/maken_ki/c001/27.html">lose to her (again)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, at the end of their duel during the introduction ceremony. And in chapter 10, Azuki <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangatown.com/manga/maken_ki/c009/6.html">outperformed her in gymnastics too.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Yzak Joule from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>.

Later, on noticing that Arthur clearly has feelings for Guinevere, Lancelot bows out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> without a fight so as not to get in the way of Arthur's intentions — even though he obviously had the more advantageous suit. Lancelot is only second best to Arthur because he chooses to be — and <em>Arthur knows it</em>.
<ul><li> Conversely, Lancelot adores Merlin and Guinevere to the point of worship. He has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stepped into the void</span> for their sakes. However, their lives revolve completely around Arthur, and he's all they ever seem to talk about in Lancelot's presence.

</li><li> Any musical act that has had several songs go to #2 but has never had a #1. In the United States:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> are the kings of this trope, reaching #2 five times without ever hitting the top spot.
</li><li> By 1981 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Foreigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Foreigner">Foreigner</a> scored five Top 10 hits in <em>Billboard</em>, with "Double Vision" hitting #2. Then "Waiting For a Girl Like You" spent an agonizing <em>ten weeks</em> at #2, kept out of the top spot mainly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn">Olivia Newton-John's</a> "Physical". They finally got to #1 with "I Want To Know What Love Is" in 1984.
</li><li> On the country chart, the record for most weeks at No. 2 without reaching No. 1 was accomplished in 1955 by Kitty Wells. The then-reigning Queen of Country Music spent an incredible <strong>15 weeks</strong> in the runner-up spot with her classic "Making Believe", stuck for every one of those weeks behind Decca Records-labelmate Webb Pierce's 21-week chart-topper "In the Jailhouse Now". Wells wasn't doing too much complaining; she already had two No. 1s hits earlier, including her signature song from three years earlier with "It Wasn't God Who Made Honky-Tonk Angels".
</li><li> The song "Only Love Can Break a Heart" — one in a country version, the other pop — had this happen twice. The first time was in 1962, when pop singer Gene Pitney was stopped at No. 2. Ten years later, Sonny James recorded a country version (one of his many covers of pop hits), and appeared primed to continue his then-prevailing consecutive No. 1s in as many single releases streak, extending it to No. 17. However, Capitol Records labelmate Freddie Hart had an even bigger song out at the same time: "My Hang-Up is You" (his follow up to "Easy Loving"), and it was Hart's six-week run at No. 1 that stopped James' "Only Love" and his No. 1 streak at 16.
</li><li> In a coincidence, Skeeter Davis' "End of the World" stopped at No. 2 on both the country and pop charts in the winter of 1963.
</li></ul></li><li> Dave Mustaine's band Megadeth have always been behind his former band Metallica in terms of popularity. He has long been frustrated about this situation (as heard in the documentary Some Kind Of Monster), despite being extremely successful himself, just out of sheer rivalry.

</li><li> "Baker Street" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty">Gerry Rafferty</a> spent six weeks at #2 in 1978, trailing "Shadow Dancing" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndyGibb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndyGibb">Andy Gibb</a> all of those weeks. <a class="urllink" href="http://jabartlett.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/at40-from-the-inside/#comment-13299">Reliable sources (scroll down) report that<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> some backroom shenanigans at <em>Billboard</em> prevented Rafferty from hitting #1.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY">PSY</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GangnamStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GangnamStyle">Gangnam Style</a>" was a massive hit, topping the chart in every country in the world... except the United States, where it got stuck at #2 for seven weeks behind Maroon 5's "One More Night". Like with "Baker Street" above, it is rumored that there was a conspiracy to keep "Gangnam" from hitting the top, and it had minimal radio airplay while "Night" was purposely kept at or near the top of the radio charts for nearly three months, as most #2 peaking hits do so against strong and stable #1s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic">OneRepublic</a> had this happen to them twice over. In 2007, their song "Apologize" became a massive hit and stayed in the Top 10 for an unprecedented <em>25 weeks</em> and once broke the record for the most spins on mainstream radio. Yet, it was held off the top spot by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a>'s "Kiss Kiss" and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys">Alicia Keys</a>' "No One". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">History Repeats</a> six years later, when they released "Counting Stars". It managed to be an <em>even bigger hit</em> than "Apologize", spending another 25 consecutive weeks in the Top 10, spent <em>68</em> weeks on the <em>Hot 100</em>, and has garnered over <em>one billion views</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. Yet, once again, they were held off from the top spot, this time by "Timber" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull">Pitbull</a> featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Kesha</a>.
</li><li> This happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake">Drake</a> with "Hotline Bling". While "Best I Ever Had" being stuck at #2 was frustrating, it was his debut single and was against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas">I Gotta Feeling</a></em>, so it was more understandable. "Bling", however, was a pop-culture phenomenon whose success spread far beyond just being "a Drake song". It was stuck behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd">The Weeknd</a>'s "The Hills" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele">Adele</a>'s "Hello". The week it looked to hit #1, The Weeknd released a remix of "The Hills" featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a> and another with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj">Nicki Minaj</a>. This gave "The Hills" a sales boost to keep it atop the charts. The week after, "Bling"'s streaming was crippled when Apple withheld the data for the release of the video. And the next week was the week "Hello" came out, ending its chances of ever hitting the top.
</li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>'s debut album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HybridTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HybridTheory">Hybrid Theory</a></em>. While it remained at #2 during its peak, it was the best-selling album of 2001 anyways (and indeed, the best-selling debut album of the 21st century).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina">Jo Dee Messina</a>'s 1999 cover of Dottie West's "Lesson in Leavin'" spent eight weeks at #2 on the country music charts, all eight of them behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a>'s "Amazed".
</li><li> This happened again in 2004, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney">Kenny Chesney</a>'s "I Go Back" spent seven weeks at the #2 position behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a>'s "Live Like You Were Dying". Even more interestingly, Chesney's song was getting an exorbitantly high amount of airplay which would've set a record for the highest airplay total for a #1 country hit if not for Tim's song ranking even higher still.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>'s "Run". It hit #2 on the December 15, 2001 country singles charts, behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith">Toby Keith</a>'s "I Wanna Talk About Me", then fell back to #3 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a>'s "Where Were You" jumped over it. "Run" then returned to #2 on the January 5, 2002 chart, again behind Alan, after which Aaron Tippin's "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly" knocked "Run" back out of the #2 position for a week. "Run" then returned to #2, but fell back to #3 again when Steve Holy's "Good Morning Beautiful" overtook it for the runner-up slot — all the while, Alan was still at #1. Steve claimed the #1 position on the February 2 chart, with "Run" falling back to #3 once more while Alan fell from #1 to #2. "Run" then jumped back to #2 <em>again</em> on the February 9 chart, still stuck behind Steve, before ultimately beginning its descent a week later.
<ul><li> On a broader scope, Strait has a record 44 #1 hits on <em>Billboard</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3c374');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3c374" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3c374');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the oft-cited number of 60 counts <em>all</em> chart publications past and present, including <em>Radio &amp; Records</em>, <em>Gavin Report</em>, and <em>Mediabase</em>, the former two of which are defunct</span>, but he has never had a #1 ranking on the <em>Billboard</em> Year-End chart for the country format. He's had the second-biggest country hit of the year four times: with "Blue Clear Sky" in 1996, "One Night at a Time" in 1997, "Write This Down" in 1999, and "I Saw God Today" in 2008.
</li></ul></li><li> Andy Griggs' 2000 hit "She's More" spent five weeks at the #2 position on the country charts. The first four were all behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill">Faith Hill</a>'s "The Way You Love Me", and the fifth by Chad Brock's "Yes!", which jumped over it from the #3 position. According to <em>Billboard</em>, one of the weeks it was stuck behind Faith, it missed the #1 position by only five spins.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt">Travis Tritt</a>'s 2001 single "It's a Great Day to Be Alive" reached #2 on the April 21, 2001 chart, behind Jessica Andrews' "Who I Am". The next week, "Ain't Nothing 'bout You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a> leapfrogged Tritt to gain the #1 position. "Great Day" spent four more weeks in the #2 position behind Brooks &amp; Dunn (who ultimately spent six weeks in the penthouse). This happened <em>again</em> on the <em>Billboard</em> Year-End country chart for 2001, where "Ain't Nothing 'bout You" was the most-played country song of 2001, and "Great Day" the second-highest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean">Jason Aldean</a>'s "Tattoos on This Town" spent six weeks at #2 in late 2011-early 2012. The first of those six weeks, it was held off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrantleyGilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrantleyGilbert">Brantley Gilbert</a>'s "Country Must Be Country Wide". One week later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyAntebellum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyAntebellum">Lady Antebellum</a>'s "We Owned the Night" jumped over it from #3, holding the position for two weeks. <em>Then</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand">Zac Brown Band</a>'s "Keep Me in Mind" also jumped over it from #3... after which the charts stood mostly still for the next few weeks, due to Christmas airplay and a lack of new single releases stagnating the charts, drawing out the #1 and #2 rankings of ZBB and Aldean even longer.
</li><li> Subverted with "Time Is Love" by Josh Turner, which only got to #2 on the country airplay charts, but was the top country hit of 2012 according to <em>Billboard</em> Year-End, due to its exorbitantly long chart run.
</li><li> "Snapback" by Old Dominion spent two weeks at the #2 position on the Country Airplay charts in 2016, getting blocked by "Mind Reader" by Dustin Lynch the first week, and "Came Here to Forget" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton">Blake Shelton</a> the second week. When the <em>Billboard</em> Year-End chart was published for 2016, "Snapback" once again ranked #2, behind "Head Over Boots" by Jon Pardi.
</li><li> "Burning House" by Cam peaked at #2 on the Hot Country Songs, Country Airplay, <em>and</em> Canadian Country charts published by <em>Billboard</em>. It was blocked on all three charts by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett">Thomas Rhett</a>'s "Die a Happy Man".
</li><li> The Bellamy Brothers are the most-nominated duo in country music history, as they have received the Academy of Country Music <em>and</em> Country Music Association "Duo of the Year" award more than any other artist... but they have never <em>won</em> it once.

He reached eleven Grand Slam finals during that time, and lost eight of them, three to Federer and five to Djokovic.

He finished runner-up in four consecutive championships, from 1955 to 1958, and finished third in the three championships after that. He's widely regarded as the greatest F1 driver never to win the title. Worth noting that he won plenty of races during that time - more than any other driver not to have won a championship, in fact.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4qsu9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4qsu9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4qsu9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Nico Rosberg broke the record in 2016 but went on to win the title that year, leaving Moss stuck with the record for the foreseeable future.</span>
<ul><li> Rubens Barrichello spent his entire career at Ferrari playing second fiddle to Michael Schumacher as he won five consecutive championships, including notoriously being ordered to drop out of first place so Michael could win. When he moved to Honda in 2006, he found himself on an equal footing with team-mate Jenson Button, only for Button to generally out-perform him, scoring a win and two podiums in that first season while Barrichello could do no better than fourth. Then in 2009 Honda became Brawn, showed up to the first race with a car that blew everyone else out of the water... and Button won six of the first seven races to claim the title, with Barrichello coming in third.

</li></ul></li><li> In snooker, Jimmy White; six times World Championship finalist (including five in a row 1990-4), six times runner-up.

</li><li> French long-distance runner Alain Mimoun finished second behind the Czech Emil Zátopek no less than 5 times, including at the 1948 and 1952 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> and was generally the one of the only runners who could keep pace with Zátopek in a race. This earned him the nickname 'Zátopek's Shadow'. It wasn't until the 1956 Olympics that Mimoun finally bested his friend and rival, coming first in the marathon while Zátopek came 6th.

The feeling that he couldn't measure up to his brother led Taketo to switch from the baseball team to soccer team to avoid competing with Yasuto, and his route shows that he has something of a complex about it.

<ul><li> The ancient Greek philosopher Eratosthenes was nicknamed "Beta" by one of his contemporaries, because he was supposedly "the second-best in the world at everything".

Using nothing but sticks, shadows, and a bit of mathematics.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams">John Adams</a>. His love of the new nation he helped form — the United States — was unparalleled. However: His cousin Sam Adams was a more fiery orator and leader of the American Revolution, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> the better writer who crafted the Declaration of Independence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> the better diplomat and political schmoozer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> the better leader. John was almost always second place to others, most notably the Second President of the United States after Washington, and he dreaded how history would overlook his contributions.
</li><li> In South Korea, professional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> player <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Jin-ho">Hong Jin-Ho<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> earned the nickname "King of Silver" after he managed to come in 2nd place in 6 different major tournaments but never won one.
</li><li> Until 2016, the Sharpe Brothers were this in competitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a>, with the two of them collectively having eight 2nd-place finishes in major pinball tournaments with no wins.

In pop culture she has become the patron saint of performers who are continuously nominated for their field's top prize without ever winning.
</li><li> More like Always <em>Third</em> Best, but Evil Geniuses's Dota 2 division qualifies. No matter who the players are, the team would almost always finish 3rd whether it be The International (averted in 2015's iteration, where they won) or the Majors. While they have the moniker of the "Lower Bracket Kings", they unfortunately would also be called having the "3rd Place Curse." Funnily lampshaded by their midlaner Sumail in his tweet: "1 2 EG 4 5."
<ul><li> Played straight, however, with Cloud9 (led by EternaLEnVy) back in 2014. During that whole year, they had an unprecedented <em>nine</em> second place finishes at the events they participated. This roster never seemed to be able to break their "2nd Place Curse" all the way until they disbanded.
