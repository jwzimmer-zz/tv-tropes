Scattered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">resistance movements</a> usually exist.
</p><p>Note that a race is a "slave race" from the point of view of the "owners" only, and it might have worked perfectly well on their own, their free population even outnumbering by far the ones that are held captive. Some slave-holder races will limit themselves to only one of these (and even maintain a friendly disposition towards everyone else), but habitual slave-holders might view everyone who is different from them as this. The slaves can often be found serving the self-proclaimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Master Race</a>.

</p><p>This of course has some uncomfortable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples. Note, however, that for the majority of history, slavery was <em>not</em> directly linked to race; beware of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">Eagleland Osmosis</a>. Historically, most people got to be slaves by running into debt, getting convicted of a crime or taken captive in war, then they'd be sold to raise cash or brought home with their captors as loot. Desperate people at times even sold themselves as slaves to have support at least. Slaves could therefore be any ethnicity, including that of their master, and prior to capture, they might be any social class ranging from peasant to king (the latter would be more probable to get ransomed sometimes of course).

A cross between felines and elves, the entire tribe became indentured to the owners of the island for an unspecified crime they committed thirty years ago. By the time of the events in the book, they have ten years to go on their debt before they're freed. However, because they have shorter lifespans than humans, several generations have now grown up in what is essentially slavery. Whereas the majority are, if not content with their lot, at least resigned to it, a resistance has sprung up with the intention of forcing the Tipaanese to renegotiate the terms of their contract. The four win the undying gratitude of the Svenjaya for helping them do this.

</li><li> One of the greatest examples is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">Homo Servus</a></em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SMStirling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SMStirling">S.M. Stirling</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraka">Draka</a> tetralogy. The <em>Servus</em> have been genetically engineered to derive orgasmic pleasure from subservience to their masters <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Homo Drakensis</a></em>, and are incapable of functioning independently .

An interesting aspect is that the <em>servus</em> are actually smarter than the Draka; the latter genetically engineered themselves into their ideal of the Master Race and it is strongly implied that in the process, they destroyed their own creativity and flexibility.
</li><li> The House-Elves from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> are another example of a slave race that's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">too happy</a> to be enslaved. They're probably based on the fairy tale "The Elves and the Shoemaker," which in turn is based on European folk tales of kobolds and similar household spirits; being bound to a house that benefits from their service gives their lives meaning, and being set free is a sign of disapproval with the services they've rendered, a very depressing concept for a creature that defines themselves by their capacity to provide excellent service. <br/><br/>Hermione is a strong believer in freedom for house-elves, but she bases her philosophy about this on Dobby, who was a unique case in that the family he served was so abusive (frequent death threats, ironing his fingers as punishment) that it was <em>worse than freedom</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">elf standards</a>; her position has actually made her extremely unpopular with the school's resident horde of elves, and when she was attempting to duplicitously free them, they went on strike, forcing the already-free Dobby to clean Gryffindor Tower all by his lonesome. Even Dobby receives only token pay for his services; Dumbledore originally offered him higher wages but Dobby insisted on lowering it.
<ul><li> The official in-universe line seems to be that they spontaneously became a Slave Race on their own, voluntary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">Servant Race</a>, as it were, and/or that they have always been like that. In stories of house-elves they are fiercely independent and extremely proud beings who do not follow orders and strongly resent being treated as mere servants, prone to spoiling the milk or tying your hair in knots if annoyed, and that presumably at some point around the passing of the Statute of Secrecy they were somehow forbidden from living in Muggle houses.
</li><li> Also 'attempt to pay them for their services and they will go away' was a general formula invoked sometimes to clear out a house-elf who'd gone lazy and troublesome and started spending all their time playing pranks instead of helping 'round the house. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken">Mythologically</a>, one could not actually <em>command</em> a house-elf any more than any other kind of elf.

But Data refused, for the stated reason that he thought the procedure would not only fail but also kill him in the process. The crux of Picard's defense of Data was to question what would become of those androids that were built to serve the Federation, beings of incredible intelligence, self-awareness, and yet if Data was ruled to not be a person, they wouldn't have any freedoms, making them a slave race.

Within several generations, the aliens predict that the humans on the ship will have forgotten that they were ever anything more than slaves. By the time that the ship reaches its destination in 500 years' time, the aliens will have approximately 100,000 completely obedient slaves to put on the market.

<ul><li> The Bible gets around the issue of how a handful of ethnically homogeneous survivors developed into all the races of Man following the Flood by inserting a story that of the three sons of Noah, two sons' families fell from grace with God and proved unworthy of His sight. Based on the following genealogies and information that the three sons spread into all corners of the world, the two younger sons were held to have been marked for their sin with yellow and black skin respectively. The Bible explicitly says that the oldest son and his people - who of course are viewed as white-skinned - have stewardship over the other peoples, who are to be their serfs and servants in perpetuity. This has been used down the ages as justification for white racial superiority and as God's blessing on owning slaves.

None of this says that the descendants of Ham were African, for instance. The ancient Jews actually believed they were the <em>Canaanites</em> (since it's Ham's son Canaan who receives the curse).

Not only did revenants now outnumber humans, but the revenants weren't happy about how they had been treated, and many were quick to enslave humans for their blood.

While by the time of the game the Corpus treat the Orokin Empire as a golden age where they lived in a technological paradise, the truth is that the Corpus were only free in name. They were really just the slaves that the Orokin used to manage the economy; an Orokin could kill a merchant and his entire family for the smallest of grievances. Even the Corpus religion and their worship of Profit was created by the Orokin to better manipulate them.

<ul><li> People of Sub-Saharan African descent were widely used as slaves everywhere from the Americas to India to various colonies within Africa, with the greatest sources of new slaves being the Atlantic slave trade (primarily run by the Portuguese, British, and Spanish) and the Arab slave trade. Native Americans were also used as slaves in the Americas, mostly in South America and Central America (cases happened in North America and the Caribbean too, but by and large there just weren't that many of them and what few there were, were independent or spread out). Problem was, the Native American slave populations kept dying because of European diseases. So their owners solved this by importing African slaves to America instead.
<ul><li> Black Africans were kept as slaves in the East as well, with India and the Middle East having the greatest number of Black slaves in the Orient. They were even found as far as Imperial China, where a Black slave was considered a luxury item given that Chinese people usually have far cheaper and nearby sources for slave labor (i.e. Mongols, Scythians, Chinese subject peoples/tribes and criminals.)
</li><li> Or else by the Arabs who had a strong slave-trading presence in black Africa. Islamic law specifically prohibits slavery - for Islamic believers. However, infidels are fair game. Thus, when white settlers in Southern Africa first encountered Arab slavers trading in blacks, they heard the Arabic word <em>kaffir</em> (non-believer, infidel) being applied to black slaves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">thought it was a generic derogatory term for all black-skinned people</a>. In some cases, even black Muslims were enslaved illegally, sometimes on <em>pilgrimages</em> to Mecca and Medina, the Islamic holy cities. It was then claimed they were infidels of course.
</li><li> Christianity too has its own doctrine justifying slavery. It has fallen somewhat out of favor in modern times, but the seldom-read part of Genesis just after Noah's Ark came to rest is the key to the theology. According to the Bible, the three sons of Noah and their families - the only humans still alive after the Flood - had a falling-out. Two of the sons were judged by the LORD to be unworthy and to have fallen from grace. They exiled themselves as far as they could, and we are told they became the first fathers of the African and Asian peoples. Meanwhile the oldest son, considered righteous in the eyes of the LORD, was the first father of the white-skinned peoples. He was told that as a reward for faithful service, the children of his lesser brothers would be given into his hands as servants and bondsmen (read: "slaves"). This doctrine - by the way, as impeccable as anything else derived from the Bible even though the morality stinks - was used to justify slavery down the ages and to give divine sanction to the right of white people to own slaves and rule. The last official vestiges of this died in the late 1990's when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">The Apartheid Era</a> ended in South Africa and the Dutch Reformed Church denounced racism. It must be noted, though, that in the verses itself the color of their descendants is not mentioned. This later interpretation was added when Europeans encountered Asians and Africans (it's unlikely the ancient Jews knew about the former).
</li></ul></li><li> The Helots, slaves/serfs of the Spartans, who outnumbered the Spartan citizenry by so much that the Spartans had a tradition of hunting them down and killing them. This wasn't considered murder; one of the duties of the ephors (Spartan magistrates) was to declare war on the Helots every year so that Spartan citizens could legally kill them (the fact that they were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by slaves who had every reason to hate them is believed by some to account for the Spartans' extreme militaristic badassery). The people from Sparta certainly considered themselves to be a breed apart, to the point that, in order to be a Spartan soldier, you had to be able to trace your origins back several generations of pure-blooded Spartans. This... did not work out so well for them, as being so incredibly exclusive in who can be a "soldier" tends to result in running out of trained soldiers. Not all wars are fought in very narrow mountain passes where numbers don't matter.
<ul><li> It is universally accepted that Spartan badassery and the Helot system were heavily intertwined... besides the perpetual siege mentality, the Helot population gave the Spartans the luxury of being able to do things like live in a barracks like a monk until age 30 by, you know, running the local economy. Funny thing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">perpetual training to be a badass</a>; you usually can't do it unless it's what you actually do for a living. The Helots were the answer to the paradox of the Spartans being citizen militiamen <em>and</em> being able to train like modern day professionals like the SEALs. Thebes would prove canny enough to note this, and after defeating Sparta in the Theban War, they demanded as part of the peace settlement that the former citizens of Messeniaâ€”i.e, the Helotsâ€”be given their freedom. There is some speculation that Pericles planned to do the same had he won.
</li><li> Sparta's "extreme" way of life has often been exaggerated by historians (ancient and modern alike). In reality, the Spartiates (the citizens/nobles â€” <em>everyone</em> in Sparta was a "Spartan", including the Helots) were probably a lot more like medieval knights than anything else: A relatively small, educated elite of professional soldiers ruling over an enserfed peasantry in exchange for military protection (although fighting on foot rather than horseback). It's notable that Spartan Helots had more in the way of rights than the chattel slaves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed">democratic Athens</a>. Also, distinguished Helots could be promoted to full Spartiate citizens, though admittedly this wasn't too common. In any case, Helot revolts were fairly common, and this seriously endangered Spartan society. They would often do this while most soldiers were off fighting a war, as you'd imagine. It meant the soldiers would have to run home and put it down before the Helots could take over.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> argued some of the "barbarian" races neighboring Greece were really "natural" slaves, and should be treated as such, in a way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">remarkably similar</a> to later "scientific racist" justifications.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1920s, Germany's anti-Communist racists put forward the view that the peoples of the Soviet Union were basically this for their 'Bolshevik overlords'. The Nazis' own views were largely derived from this, but had a more anti-Semitic focus: when they took power they propagated the view that the "Asiatic Hordes" of the Soviet Union were held in thrall to a "<em>Judeo</em>-Bolshevik Conspiracy" instead. The entire concept was very popular because it made people feel that they were heroes bravely defending themselves from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> types and their legions of Slave Race Mooks.
<div class="indent">"A whole people has systematically been reared into subhumanity. This is clearly the most Satanic educational plan of all times, which only Jewish sadism could have constructed and carried through [...] It will be necessary to scorch out this boil of plague radically, [...] [since their goal] was the brutalization of a whole people, in order to make use of it as an instrument in the war for Judas's world domination." - <em>Heer</em> [Army] Captain Hans Kondruss (July 1941?), translated by Omer Bartov.
</div></li><li> This was central to the short-term plans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> for its empire in Eastern Europe, as only partially enacted during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, since it was accepted that replacing the population with a comparable number of pure-blooded ethnic Aryans and Germans would take at least a generation. As a practical matter it seems to have been accepted that some degree of bastardization would be acceptable, provided it was with the 'purer' Aryan and German elements which could be found in the region. The prevalence of blue eyes and blonde hair among them earned the Baltic ethnicities a 50% survival threshold, for instance. The Caucasians (Azerbaijanis, Georgians) and Mongols (Tatars, Kazakhs) weren't going to be so lucky.
<ul><li> Some Nazis even invoked the above example; Heinrich Himmler once said that the Russian people would be the Helots to Germany's Spartans.
</li><li> In the short-term, Hitler and Himmler wanted something like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Feudal Future</a> in the former Russia (all of these "plans" were basically paper exercises/flights of fancy by the latter's staff that never came anywhere close to implementation). While most would be enslaved for now and be phased out later, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">"worthy"</a> elements would actually be accepted as part of the new Spartan/noble elite and ultimately survive. As quite a few of the SS generals were themselves of Slavic origins (e.g., General von dem Bach-<strong>Zelewski</strong>), a purely "racial" view of citizenship would not have been acceptable.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyergus">This genus of ants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> enslaves other species of ants by invading their nests and killing their queens.
</li><li> Subverted with most modern forms of slavery. Nowadays, slavers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">don't give a crap about the ethnicity</a> of their victims as long as they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">make money</a> with them. Most of them outright <strong>share</strong> their nationality, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">is nothing new at all</a>. Having slaves of a different race is the more unusual thing historically, because historically most slaves were war captives and generally you went to war with your neighbor who looked like you (like the Greeks above).
</li><li> Dogs. They're specifically bred and raised by humans for a variety of tasks; they help hunters catch and retrieve game, they help farmers herd sheep and cattle, they guide the blind and otherwise disabled, they pull sleds in the frozen tundra and icy wastes of the North, they protect public and private property, they track criminals, they sniff out drugs and explosives in the police and military, and they serve as faithful companions. They're a Slave Race in every sense. However, they're a very loyal, well-treated and well-loved Slave Race, and the only animal to be considered "Man's Best Friend".
<ul><li> After all the selective breeding, they're probably closer to being an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">Servant Race</a>. They've diverged very substantially from the original tamed wolves.
</li><li> Cats, not so much. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreSuperior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreSuperior">cats probably thinks humans are</a> <em>their</em> Slave Race.
</li></ul></li><li> Most livestock animals would count. Cows, horses, goats, and sheep have been domesticated by humans for labor and food.
</li><li> The word "slave" is derived from the word "Slav" because Slavs were used as a Slave Race for a very long time, which might be how the aforementioned Nazis got the idea.
<ul><li> This incidentally derives from the fact that Slavs were among the last people to convert to Christianity in the Northern Europe and while Christianity doesn't tolerate enslaving fellow believers, pagans â€” and even followers of competing denominations â€” have been fair game for most of the history.
</li><li> The Ottomans used or shipped millions of slaves from Russia and Ukraine due to the constant Tatar slave raids in that region, which only ended when the Crimean Khanate was totally subdued.
