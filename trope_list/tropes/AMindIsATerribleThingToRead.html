She becomes very distraught when she discovers that the vast majority of the people around her have rather disturbing thoughts, thoughts better left unread. Her friends are only using her. Her lover has been cheating since day one. People she passes in the street are brimming with barely-contained malice and pain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">Every random guy she meets</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyMindReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyMindReading">wonders what she looks like naked</a>.

In this case, Alice will probably end up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">jaded misanthrope</a>, a doleful hermit, or maybe just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">really depressed</a>.

<ul><li> Naoya's mindreading powers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NightHeadGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NightHeadGenesis">Night Head Genesis</a></em> give him a lot of grief, and it doesn't help that 90% of people in the anime are either evil or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">traumatized beyond repair</a>. Particularly horrific visions cause him to hallucinate for hours, even days, on end. When he experiences his visions, they are also capable of rebounding off to the people surrounding him, leaving more room for judgement and ridicule. Even touching objects can trigger unfortunate visions. His older brother spends <em>a lot</em> of time looking after him.
</li><li> Yoshiki, a high school student in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BoogiepopPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BoogiepopPhantom">Boogiepop Phantom</a></em>, gains an incontinent ability to hear peoples' thoughts in episode nine, "You'll Never Be Young Twice". He promptly discovers that all of his friends dislike him, only sticking around to leech his money. He then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">gives his mind away</a> to a bad guy out of desperation.
</li><li> Mao's Geass in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> makes him an example of this trope. Lelouch calls out C.C. on this, seeing as she gave him the ability in the first place and let him roam around going nuts from hearing the base thoughts of everyone around him.
</li><li> One chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Dororo</a> interrupt his team-mates' scheming to protest a particularly underhanded plot, only to be met with stunned silence. He promptly whips out a mind-reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousNinja">ninja art</a> and uses it on the other members to see what they think about him. The answer sends him right into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CornerOfWoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CornerOfWoe">Corner of Woe</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> reading minds is usually harmless, but reading the mind of a suicidally depressed rape and abuse victim held in captivity for 16 years since she was 10 (her daughter is <em>at least</em> 10 years old) is <em>not</em> recommended.
</li><li> Getting stuck inside other people's fantasies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Paprika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Paprika">Paprika</a></em> is dangerous enough, but it's even worse when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the wall between reality and fantasy begins to erode and one of the users of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> dies, creating a psychic black hole.</span>
</li><li> This is the entire plot of the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em>, where one country developed a technology to allow its citizens to read one another's minds. This becomes so unbearable that they all move out to the countryside and stay out of each other's "mental ranges."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, the mind-reader Murota seems to have no problem with his telepathic powers... until he reads the mind of Sensui <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his other six personalities</span>, after which he has a severe nervous breakdown before being taken out by one of Sensui's henchmen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is part of the reason main antagonist Hao went batshit insane and became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>. An accident left him with a very dangerous ability, Reishi ("Reading the Heart"), that he could not control. The negative emotions and thoughts of others constantly overwhelming him and, since he was unable to turn his Reishi off, the deluge of negativity eventually drove him to become the Shaman King so that he could create a Shaman only kingdom on earth.
</li><li> Anna also had a powerful Reishi ability as a child. By the time she first met Yoh in person, it was causing her to accidentally manifest demons when she was around other people. She lost her Reishi powers not long after that meeting, sealing it herself after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Matamune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed</a> himself to help Yoh defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Oo-Oni</a> created by Anna's Reishi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em> doujin rewrote Schuldig and Omis confrontation to have Omi fighting Schuldig s mind reading abilities by first imagining Schuldig in a Tutu followed closely by a Schuldig/Reiji Takatori romantic scene. Schuldig ended up begging for mercy while Omi threatened to imagine even more vivid scenarios.
</li><li> Shiho from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren">Zettai Karen Children</a></em> has the ability since birth. At the beginning of the series she is somewhere around 12 and pretty much despairs of humanity.
<ul><li> Made even worse by some of the ways others use her powers. Her <em>own father</em> the police chief has her read evidence in murder investigations, meaning she has been exposed to visions of horrible killings and corpses. She is a tad morbid and disturbing as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> The minor character of the boyfriend of Shin's babysitter on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em> is a telepath (although she doesn't this); it's mainly used for throw away jokes where he laments being able to read his neurotic girlfriend's mind while she she thanks god he can't hear all the crazy things she thinks and worries about.
</li><li> Whenever Nodoka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> uses her artifact in any situation that's not very serious, she tends to learn things she really wishes she hadn't. Not <em>terrible</em> things, but very awkward. First she tries it on herself and realizes she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">Covert Pervert</a>. Later she tries testing out some new equipment she got and learns that she accidentally set up a love triangle among some new friends. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And after that when she tries reading Negi's mind when he's gone berserk the diary pages literally go black with rage and hatred. Since she presumably still had on that equipment, imagine what horrible things she must have heard.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> anime-only character Satori has the power of mind reading. When he visits the Tendo house he tries to prove it by reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">Nabiki's</a> mind first, but he gets terrified by almost drowning in money. Then he reads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Happosai's</a> mind, it's unknown what he saw but he faints with a nosebleed. When he regains consciousness he complains that this family is so weird.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em>, Yakumo's ability to see the thoughts of people who are infatuated/in love with her (As text floating in the air) generally only makes her miserable. She gets asked out/confessed to/propositioned by boys all the time, but is put off by what they REALLY want. (Except for Hanai, who actually thinks what he says, but he puts her off in other ways.) Even worse, she can't read the guy she's actually interested in, because he's one of the few guys she knows that is NOT infatuated with her.
<ul><li> The exceptions are her sister, whom she can read the mind of and cares very deeply for, and a cat she adopted, whose thoughts are unintelligible because they're still in cat.
</li></ul></li><li> Yukuhashi Mizou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> has this problem.

Over the course of three books, she realizes her brother is secretly gay and in a relationship with an illegal immigrant, kisses her teacher because she hears him thinking about how beautiful and smart he thinks she is (this leads to her dad getting him fired), is able to win just enough money gambling to get her new boyfriend's loan sharks to demand interest on his debts (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which leads to the boyfriend's death and her kidnapping, though she does manage to escape with her own ransom</span>), finding out that her college roommate, who she had an actually healthy friendship with, was in love with the same teacher she kissed before, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and sees that her next roommate used her own psychic powers to make her little half-sister murder their parents</span>.

Like the time he met a thing called IT and nearly went into a coma. Or the time he read Superman's mind when he was controlled by Mageddon and nearly went into a coma. Or the time he read the mind of a nihilistic teenager and had to leave the planet in order to perform a Martian psychic cleansing ritual.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> Black Adam does this to the Manhunter all by himself.

Damn nigh gave himself a stroke with <em>two minutes</em> of effort. Course <em>The Joker's</em> mind would give anyone nightmares. And it did work, it just didn't last.
</li><li> Another one in <em>Martian Manhunter</em> #23 is when J'onn is in his P.I. alter ego John Jones and he tries to scan Jim Corrigan AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a>. While J'onn didn't sense anything amiss when he was talking to Corrigan (though they are bonded and essentially the same person, they also have very distinctly different personalities), when he tried to do a simple mind scan (I.E. just a quick surface thoughts read, nothing invasive), the image of the Spectre putting on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> appeared and J'onn almost had an aneurysm.

<ul><li> And interestingly inverted in the way her telepathy scuppered her romance with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sistah Spooky</span>; instead of being unable to have a romance because she had full access to all her partner's most unpleasant thoughts (as is normal for this trope), her partner was too self-loathing to believe that anyone who could see through her facade would be capable of truly loving her. Mindf██k herself thinks the partner's mind is very sexy, and does deeply love the "beautiful mess" she is beneath her mask.

His power, called "inductive telepathy", lets him see the true answers to whatever questions he asks someone. When he encounters Jukko, whose entire body is covered with scars, he asks on impulse what happened to him. He suffers a near-fatal seizure from the instant download of all of Jukko's traumatic memories, and in later issues, continues to have nightmares about them. Jukko himself could be said to qualify, as his power is hyper-empathy, which results in him feeling the pain of every being within a four mile radius.

</li><li> In another strip, the Pointy Haired Boss is talking about how the company with whom they are merging is made up of mental giants who can read employees' minds and torture them mentally if they dislike what they find. Wally, not terribly frightened despite having just witnessed a demonstration of the latter ability, remarks that "if they try reading mine, they'll go blind." A later comic where Catbert does indeed go blind from reading a paper readout of Wally's mind seems to prove him right.

After all of the remaining leaders and the head are at the safest stronghold, he begins butchering their elite mooks with his lightsaber, his bare hands, a blaster, and the Force. The last one he fights before he kills most of the crime lords is a telepathic alien who tries to read his mind, but Darth Maul is so infused with the dark side of the Force the telepath either dies or goes into a permanent state of shock, complete with black blood dripping from his nose.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfAlvinMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfAlvinMaker">The Tales of Alvin Maker</a></em> series, Peggy's ability to see into people's hearts doesn't bother <em>her</em> very much, but the fact that she knows all the deepest secrets of everyone she encounters makes other people very uncomfortable, and her being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Little Miss Snarker</a> doesn't help much. She eventually gets lessons in social skills that include practicing <em>not</em> automatically reading everyone's mind; when it's all done, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">all grown up</a> and extremely popular.
</li><li> Card also discusses this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorthingSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorthingSaga">The Worthing Saga</a></em>, though there it's a little bleaker, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">other people's memories feel just as real as one's own</a>. Jason Worthing is a virgin, but in his memory he's been involved in "acts he did not think his neighbors had enough imagination to invent." At the story's opening he's never killed, but he clearly remembers killing a man in a riot. All the worst aspects of humanity are a part of him.

He knows when they lie either to others or to themselves. In fact, the main reason for his attraction to Jax is that she doesn't lie and there's no disconnect between what she's thinking and what she's saying.
</li><li> The main character's wife in <em>Frameshift</em> by Robert J. Sawyer can read minds due to a frameshift mutation. She developed a dislike of men because of the disgusting things they think about doing to her, and married the protagonist partially because he thinks in his first language (French), and she can't understand his thoughts.
</li><li> The short story "Through Other Eyes" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RALafferty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RALafferty">R. A. Lafferty</a> involves a scientist who's spent his entire life wondering whether everyone experiences things the same way he does—whether what he calls red really looks to others like what he calls blue, whether roses smell as sweet, and so on. He builds a machine to translate the thoughts in one mind to another, and uses it on a woman he considers himself to be in love with. Through it, he learns that she sees the world as a place of vileness and horror; that (as she herself later says) every time a bird flies by she thinks of what's gurgling in its stomach—and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">glories in it</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later on, she absolutely <em>smashes</em> him mentally by convincing him he has the worse worldview—her world is twistedly beautiful, and his is utterly dead, lacking in any sort of romance or wonder. At the story's close, he's almost ready to sell the device to the public—but first, he's modifying it so it lies to the user, making the subject's thoughts seem less different than they really are, because true understanding is just too horrible.</span>

Unfortunately, the bad guys know this from the beginning, and from the moment that she joins the group, the bad guys constantly throw horrible and disturbing thoughts at her to try and break her. This is made worse because the bad guys range from a chaotic evil cannibal to a lawful evil warlord wannabe, and just their ordinary thoughts would be bad enough.
<ul><li> Even an ordinary person's mind is deeply disturbing at times: Leitha herself states that most humans are much closer to animals than they would ever like to admit, and given that she's a rather beautiful woman, from men she tends to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyMindReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyMindReading">horribly perverse thoughts</a>, while from women she tends to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">spiteful and jealous thoughts.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>, Edward Cullen's telepathy is strongly hinted at as one of the reasons he's so alone prior to Bella's coming to Forks. He's rich, handsome, smart, strong, and wanted by every woman who comes in contact with him (it seems), but he ends up falling in love with a rather dull, uninspiring, self-described plain girl whose distinguishing feature is the fact that <em>he can't read her mind.</em>
</li><li> Jeremy Bremen from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSimmons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSimmons">Dan Simmons</a>' <em>The Hollow Man</em> suffers this as soon as his wife dies, who was the only other telepath he had met. Being around large crowds of people makes him suffer horrible migraines, considering his ability is the equivalent of watching thousands of television shows at once in 3D at full volume with no way to turn it off. The only people who he can be around with no negative effects to him are those who are mentally deficient or psychotic.

Though this is normal for them, the Animorphs found it disturbing when they morphed into Leerans and suddenly could hear each other's neuroses. Luckily, they figured out how to shut it off.
</li><li> This is pretty much what did in the Martians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMartianChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMartianChronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a></em>. While they were perfectly fine being telepathic by themselves, the sheer novelty of thoughts emanating from the first handfuls of human explorers were enough to drive them completely insane, resulting in the rapid downfall of their civilization and the destruction of the entire species.
</li><li> A major danger for the Tines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFireUponTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFireUponTheDeep">A Fire Upon the Deep</a></em>, who are all sort of mini-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>s (usually about 3-8 Tines per each individual pack) that think by transmitting their thoughts as sound among packmates. Because of this, the notion of personal space means having enough distance (usually about 20' or more) where they can whisper politely among themselves and yell at normal conversational levels to chat with other packs, as being closer means the packs' thoughts will muddle together making coherent thought impossible without intense concentration. Such mental discipline is especially crucial during close combat, as weaker-minded packs will break down into animalistic singletons under such proximity to another pack.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>'s <em>Distant Friends</em> series, telepaths coming closer than 20 miles apart experience insanity, identity confusion, and pain. If they continue approaching each other, the strain kills them. Two of these telepaths have fallen in love. One of the two commissions a gizmo that blocks the telepathy so that he can be with his beloved; unfortunately, the inventor turns out to be a villain, tricks him into a chase ending at the beloved's house, then holds the telepathic pair hostage by threatening to turn off the machine.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> the title character's late father, James, used to have a bitter teenage rivalry with Harry's least favorite teacher, Snape; naturally, Harry disregards every single thing Snape says about his father being a pompous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>. At one point Harry uses a magical device called a Pensieve, which stores thoughts, to see a memory Snape put in. To Harry's horror, the memory shows James acting like a self-absorbed jackass and humiliating Snape for no reason. It ends with Harry's own mother, Lily, coming to Snape's defense and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">telling James that he's a miserable person who absolutely disgusts her</a>.

</li><li> In <em>Mephisto In Onyx</em>, Rudy Pairis is a telepath who has yet to encounter a mind that doesn't make him want to vomit. Unfortunately, he frequently finds himself in situations where he is tempted to reach out and touch some mind. The story gets rolling when a friend he can't turn down asks him to read the mind of a convicted serial killer to prove him innocent. It doesn't go well from there.
</li><li> Mahnahmi from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> series was born a telepath, fully aware of the thoughts of everyone around her. As it happened, she came into the care of a certain fellow by the name of Conda Challis, who was probably in the running for the Most Depraved Person of the Commonwealth award. Among the least of the things she learned was that he intended to use her as a torture/sex slave when she grew up. This, understandably, permanently warped her psyche and drove her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">utter nihilism</a>.
</li><li> The protagonist of Robert Silverberg's <em>Dying Inside</em> can read other people's minds, and he is unable to function in society because of it.
</li><li> The young-adult book "the lies they tell" tells the story of a young girl who develops telepathic abilities after a blow to the head. She has some upsetting experiences, but eventually learns how to block out thoughts, and manages to discover a corrupt politician's dastardly plot.
</li><li> A short story featured a black businessman who frequently harangued the people around him. When a scientist appears with a helmet that he claims can allow you to read minds he promptly tries it on and starts hearing just how much people hate him, either for his behavior or his race. Worse the helmet burns out leaving him permanently stuck hearing the thoughts of everyone around him driving him insane due to being unable to cope with reality being far harsher than the fantasy he'd lived that people liked him. Eventually he commits suicide in the asylum they place him in (no surprise there, given what kind of thoughts he got bombarded with THERE).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosWalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosWalking">Chaos Walking</a></em> trilogy has this in the form of the Noise germ, which basically means that any thought (in the form of words, fragments of sentences, or even pictures) flows from the mind of the thinker, and is out there for anyone to hear/read/see. Todd, the main character, even comments that Noise can have 'texture' and 'colour', reflecting the emotional state of the thinker. This is where the series gets its title, and the constant flow of Noise is understandably difficult to cope with. Also, in an even darker twist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fact that only men produce Noise led to much paranoia and hatred between the sexes in the early years of settlement on the new world, to the point that the men of Prentisstown slaughtered all of the women unlucky enough to stay</span>.

Truthsayers touch the accused and scan his or her mind in order to determine guilt or innocence. A Truthsayer's verdict is final and cannot be appealed (there is no higher authority). However, given the kind of minds they scan, Truthsayers have to undergo years of training (from early childhood) in order to detach themselves from crawling around minds of murderers (they don't deal with lesser crimes). The book's main story arc involves a young female Truthsayer who, after crawling around in the head of an insane mass murderer (who believes in the rightness of his brand of justice), is <em>extremely</em> disturbed. Her next scan is of a young dockworker who was caught next to the body of his supervisor (wrong place at the wrong time). However, the dockworker still felt intense guilt over failing to submit his paperwork on time, and this, coupled with her previous experiences, resulted in her declaring him guilty. She did finally realize she was wrong a few days later, but too late for the poor kid who has already been sent to an orbital facility from where no one returns.

</li><li> Kelly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> develops the power of telepathy, which only heightens and exacerbates her personal insecurity as she is frequently judged harshly by the people she encounters - while she is a genuinely kind and sensitive person she's something of a rough diamond who uses her abrasiveness and slightly gaudy appearance to mask her low self-esteem. Her power causes her to break up with her fiancee, and generally hear a lot of things she'd rather not about the way people see her. Also, she tends to hit or shout at people whose thoughts particularly offend her (making her look entirely mad, of course) and she frequently embarrasses others when she blurts out their secrets without thinking, so really her power sucks for just about <em>everyone</em> involved.

She is initially overwhelmed, but learns to control it. Similar to the Buffy example above, it had more to do with the volume of thoughts than what she was hearing. She ends up helping her father fight crime, against her mother's wishes, become elected to student council and makes a guy like her.

One of them is determined to prove that using psychics in this manner is a bad idea by deliberately giving false information to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain Bridger</a> (e.g. that the Libyan ambassador is bluffing when he isn't).

She also discovers that Bridger himself has latent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> and even tries to train him a bit in using them.

Daniel replies that the knowledge is <em>infinite</em>, so only a non-corporeal being could possibly make sense of it.

<ul><li> In the episode "Devil in the Dark'', Spock felt incredible mental pain when he first tried to establish a Vulcan Mind Link with the Horta. He did better on the second try, probably because the creature was more trusting or because he knew what to expect and blocked the pain.

However, during the episode's climax, it's revealed that he may have suspected something and deliberately blocked out his mind, only letting carefully-selected thoughts slip to let Tosh know what to do.

Moreover, the point is made that thoughts aren't always an accurate gauge of people's real intentions.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> goes through this from time to time: In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> he is forced to read the thoughts of an entire city. The effect is... disillusioning to say the least. While he wasn't surprised by the hatred, the pure and constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfishness</a> of people almost made him leave the team because he was so disgusted by it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">wondered why he should even help them</a>. He regained his faith in humanity, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">when he stumbled upon a search party looking for a little girl in the woods</a> and "heard" all the thoughts concerned purely with helping a lost little kid. Even the ones who weren't even related to her only cared about finding her.
</li><li> Invoked by Batman in an earlier episode, when almost the entire League is incapacitated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">Dream Walker</a> villain. Batman is the last of them to keep himself awake and warns the bad guy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">his mind is not a nice place to be</a>. As in, even a hostile intruder would take damage from the kind of thoughts Bruce lives with all the time.
</li></ul></li><li> In a variation on this trope, in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em>, a New Age spiritualist decides to try and read Duckman's aura, which she describes as his essence, the very nature of his soul. She then runs away, shrieking in absolute horror.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em>, Timmy wishes to get mind-reading powers, but unfortunately, his fairy-obsessed teacher figures that out and exploits this trope by getting everyone to stand around Timmy and think, causing the banal thoughts of everyone around him to overload his head.
</li><li> In the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> movie, Fry suddenly gains mind-reading abilities, and is soon overwhelmed by the random brain-chatter of everyone around him. After he figures out what's going on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">(and realizes he isn't invisible)</a> a mind-reading hobo gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinfoilHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinfoilHat">Tinfoil Hat</a> to block the brainwaves.
</li><li> In an episode of the US Acres side of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, aliens give Orson the pig a device that gives him the power to read minds ("how did you know I wanted the power to read minds?" Orson asked, and quickly realized it was a stupid question). He uses it to topple a corrupt game show, but then throws it into a river because it's a power he decides he doesn't want. The episode closes with the alien on his ship in the company of another alien, who is concerned that the Earthling would not know what to do with it. The alien who gave the device to Orson then turns on the viewscreen and they remotely observe Orson throwing the device into the river, and the episode ends with the alien who gave it to him saying "See? He knew exactly what to do with it."

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> episode "Claw and Hoarder", after Jerry returns with a cat that can talk for unexplained reasons, Rick performs a mind-scan to learn its secret. Immediately both Rick and Jerry are disgusted and horrified by seeing the truth, demanding the cat leaves while the both of them continue freaking out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em>: In "The Slaver Weapon", the cat-like alien Kzinti have a telepath that they use to eavesdrop on their human (or half-Vulcan) prisoners. Spock instructs the crew to think of eating delicious raw salads, which disgusts the meat-eating Kzinti so much that they can't continue to read their minds.

The combination of this shocking revelation and the sheer power of the Dark Side veiling Vader's mind causes Ahsoka to scream and then faint. When she wakes up, she denies knowing anything about the Imperial pilot, and it's made clear to the audience that she's lying and deeply in denial about it.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, when Manhunter tries to enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s mind, it ends with him doubling over in pain.
