<p>In a story that allows for some degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">Story Branching</a>, a character is presented with a clear number of choices each with their own viable outcomes. However, one of these options sometimes appears to be substantially more developed than the others or appears to coincide better with the plot as a whole, as if the author wanted the players to follow this path and added all others as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">mere diversions</a>. This is an example of Story Branch Favoritism on the developer's part, where a particular branch of the story features more content or is better developed than others — but does <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">render any of the other branches non-canon</a>.

Alternatively, some games employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> to let the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> pair off with any of the cast member they choose, but one particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest">unfairly promoted over others</a>.
</p><p>Of course, sometimes it's just that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>. A player who goes around killing or pissing off important NPC's is naturally going to have less people wanting to associate with him and give him things to do.

Related tropes also include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine">Follow the Plotted Line</a>, where the writer forces a character to follow a specific path regardless to what other options are available. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath">Golden Path</a> can be one of the most noticeable consequences of this trope. When this trope is applied to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">Romance Sidequest</a>, that's one way of getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest">Designated Love Interest</a>.

<ul><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> has several potential ally commanders in the final battle depending on which path you took to get there, but having Eagle on your side (use Sami for all the Green Earth missions) is given a bit more weight than the others: it's the only option that unlocks a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> mission afterwards, he overrides all other options for the 3rd CO and his route is the only one to give closure to the Eagle/Andy rivalry subplot. Future games would give Eagle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Sami, which follows on from her branch of the Green Earth missions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>'s story branches at two points — you can pick one of three options for a guide to Viper Manor, and you can declare that <em>of course</em> you'll <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save Kid from Lynx's poison</span> or else confess that you don't know <em>how</em>.
<ul><li> In the first case, Nikki's route through the Shadow Forest is the longest and most developed, including an entire dungeon (including a boss battle with Zoah, who you won't meet until later otherwise). Guile's route has a brief climb up Viper Manor's seaside cliffs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">but matches up the best with what happens at the end of the dungeon</a>), while Pierre's route consists entirely of a boss battle and nothing else.
</li><li> The second case is more complex. Announcing that you'll handle the problem leads to an entire dungeon that you don't get to play otherwise, and while saying you're not sure doesn't lead to any replacement dungeon it still allows you to recruit a highly plot-relevant character who also happens to be one of the game's most powerful fighters. Further complicating the matter, if you do refuse, Kid's life gets saved anyway via an implausible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In Chrono Cross's predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, if you follow the sidequest to restore the desert, then botch (deliberately or otherwise) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">timed event</a> in Lucca's past, the conversation between her and Robo afterward is bittersweet, but satisfying. Succeed in the event, and she and Robo don't say anything to each other (though she still gets the item Robo gives her during the conversation), with your only reward being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucca's mom being able to walk again</span>.
</li><li> Halfway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV">Dragon Quest V</a></em>, you have to choose one of two girls to marry: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Nera</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Bianca</a>. Bianca is the favored bride, having known you the longest and being depicted as such in most of the promotional art, along with her children. There's also the fact that Nera already has a love interest before you meet here, and you meet her <em>just a few days before the in-game choice of who to marry</em>. (That choosing Nera as your bride causes Bianca to undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> of misery is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">Urban Legend of Zelda</a> that got <em>way</em> out of hand.) The DS remake averts this by having Nera (and her remake-exclusive sister Debora) <em>also</em> meet the hero when they were children, and gives Bianca <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove">an alternate love interest</a> if she's not chosen. But the promotional art still uses Bianca as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">The Face</a> of the game and almost exclusively depicts the hero's children with Bianca's blonde hair rather than Nera's blue or Debora's black, so the trope hasn't gone away entirely (probably because Square Enix is well aware that Hero/Bianca has always been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> and Bianca the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DQ5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DQ5">DQ 5</a> is best known for). The Playstation 2 version (which is incredibly broken and allows you to skip 99% of the game) even defaults to Bianca being your wife if you don't the marriage choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> plays with this concept a bit. On the one hand, Ending A is the least "bad" of the endings, and is what the players gets after a single playthrough. It's also the canonical ending that led into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard2">Drakengard 2</a></em>. On the other hand, Ending B answers more questions, ties up more loose ends, and generally fits better with the overall tragic and dark nature of the game. This leads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">something safer</a>. On the other other hand, the game's lead designer Taro Yoko had nothing to do with <em>Drakengard 2</em>'s development; when he finally returned to the series with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em>, it followed after the events of Ending E, the ending most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">out of left field</a>, and the one the fewest players would ever see.
<ul><li> And then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard3">Drakengard 3</a></em> throws in another doozy: Every ending of every game, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">weird ones</a>, are considered canonical, as possible outcomes of a varying timeline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drakengard 3 is the first chronologically, and the goal of its narrator is to oversee events being pushed onto the only timeline that conclusively <em>prevents</em> the horrifying events of the rest of the series.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em>, the story ultimately has 2 mutually exclusive endings which revolve around <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who wins the final battle between 9S and A2.</span> And as far as narrative goes, the game favors <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the 9S ending in multiple ways. During the final battle, while playing as 9S there is dialogue between him and A2 that isn't there when playing as A2. 9S's ending has two possible sub-endings, while A2's only has one possible ending. And finally, 9S's ending leads into the 5th and final ending much more neatly than A2's ending does, since the 5th ending states that every Yorha unit is dead, which is explicit in 9S's ending (where he kills A2 but then accidentally impales himself on her sword) but less explicit in A2's (where A2 definitely dies, but 9S's not dead yet body is carried away by his pod).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Starting off in the World of Ruin portion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has Celes stranded on an island with Cid and has grown ill due to neglecting his own health to keep Celes healthy. If you keep Cid alive, he reveals a hidden staircase leading to the basement with a raft made so that Celes can escape and find her friends. If Cid dies, Celes thinks Cid is playing a prank and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp">begs him to wake up</a> before realizing that Cid is truly gone. Overcome with despair of losing what was basically a father to her and being alone without her friends, Celes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">jumps off a cliff</a> to end it all. She survives anyway and sees a bird carrying Locke's bandana, which gives her hope that her friends are alive and she sets out to find them after finding the raft Cid left behind. Given that the "Cid dies" scene is a lot more developed than the "Cid lives" scene, it seems that the writers preferred to have Celes find hope again on her own.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Aerith's date sequence is the longest, makes the most sense with the previous plot (she'd previously offered to go on a date with Cloud in her opening scene; she'd previously been responsible for choosing Marlene's hiding place), the aesthetic themes of her character (she and Cloud played in a children's park earlier in the game, so it fits that she wants to take him to an amusement park), and with the plot structure (the date is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> before two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episodes</a> that focus heavily on Aeris). It also contains a significant bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> concerning Zack, and is the easiest date to get. Tifa's date is a little shorter, a little harder to get, and only foreshadows the fact that Tifa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut">keeping something bottled up around Cloud</a>, which is not new information. Yuffie's date is slightly shorter again and has the least plot importance, as Yuffie doesn't know anything about Cloud's past and doesn't know who Marlene is, meaning Cloud gets to talk to Marlene (when his date will do that on all other routes). Barret's date is by far the shortest, skipping the play sequence, going straight to the gondola ride, and having fewer lines even there, none of which foreshadow anything. He doesn't even get a more fleshed-out version of the scene with Marlene, even though he's the closest to her in the cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em> has a form of "gameplay branch favoritism". The three starting villagers, Grey, Tobin and Kliff, can choose to promote into several different classes, but early dialogue in Ram Village heavily encourages making Grey a Mercenary, Tobin an Archer, and Kliff a Mage. Kliff's case is particularly notable: he gets the widest spell learnset of the three, he's a magic user in the spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a></em>, and the remake's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

Ayra: Lex, Chulainn, Arden. Lachesis: Naoise, Beowulf, Dew. Silvia: Lewyn, Alec, Claud. Erinys: Lewyn, Naoise, Arden. Tailtiu: Lex, Azelle, Lewyn. Brigid: Midir, Jamke, Alec</span>. These pairings are usually the easiest to make and have optional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moments in earlier chapters, while most other pairings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight">get no dialogue at all</a>. The fandom usually terms these "predestined pairings". For an odd example, although Finn does <em>not</em> have any "predestined" conversations with the first-gen ladies (despite his pairing with Lachesis being treated as canon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em>), he gets his own set of "predestined" conversations where he talks to his daughter instead (as he leaves the party before the first-gen conversations occur and only returns in the second generation); these apply to Larcei (Ayra), Lana (Edain), and Nanna (Lachesis), with Nanna being even the only one of the three who recognizes him as her father!
</li><li> This happens with the three Lords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em>. Each of them have at least three options whom they can marry, but with Eliwood it's canonical that Ninian will always have feelings for him, while Lyn and Hector have a particularly heartfelt conversation with each other in the "Pirate Ship" chapter.
</li><li> There are two possible outcomes to the Black Knight battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>. If Ike can't defeat him, Nasir is forced to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save Ike and Ena. Ena will then join the party, but is <em>severely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">Overrated and Underleveled</a>, and you get less dialogue in the final chapter due to Nasir's absence. If Ike defeats the Black Knight, both Nasir and Ena survive, and the far stronger Nasir is recruited instead of Ena. Nasir is alive and well in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>, and that game's story makes it clear that Ike defeated the Black Knight in the last war.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, Chrom is able to marry one of five playable girls (the Female Avatar, Sumia, Sully, Maribelle, or Olivia), and while he technically has no canon wife, the game <em>heavily</em> pushes him with two of them the most; Sumia and the Female Avatar.
<ul><li> With Sumia, she has a steady amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> throughout the first half of the game. She even appears alongside Chrom holding baby Lucina in the game's opening movie, as well as giving them an animated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a> cutscene that was even titled "Lovebirds" in the English version. She also has the fastest support growth with him, and the highest priority for auto-marriage in the case of tied supports.
</li><li> On the flip side is the Female Avatar. An Avatar of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">either gender</a> has a steady amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> throughout the game, even after Chroms mandatory marriage or if the Avatars married to someone else. A Female Avatar married to Chrom is the only one of his potential love interests who doesnt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenforCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenforCheating">accuse him of cheating on her</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseinContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseinContext">their daughter from the future</a></span>, limiting herself to merely point out the possibility. If she isnt married to Chrom, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo">then Lucina accuses her of making advances towards him</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperonDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperonDeck">later DEMANDS she fall for him</a></span>. And, rather jarringly, its only Chrom who makes a fuss should <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Avatar choose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice</a> themselves to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Grima</a></span> regardless if either of them are married to someone else.
</li><li> Besides that, while in the plot there are no hints of other couples and the player is free to play matchmaker as they see fit and ship to their heart's content, it's something of a hidden mechanic that several characters, particular those of the first generation, are capable of advancing their romance with certain characters much more quickly than with others; such pairings include Lissa/Vaike, Miriel/Stahl, Maribelle/Frederick, Ricken/Panne, Tharja/Gaius, Libra/Cordelia, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucina/Laurent</span>, etc. So there's an advantage for going for these pairings rather than others.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similarly to <em>Awakening</em>, the male Avatar's romance options heavily favor Azura. While not as blatant as Chrom and <em>Awakening</em>'s Avatar, the two get plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> throughout the game, <em>especially</em> in the <em>Birthright</em> route where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azura gets to spend her final moments with him, regardless of whether she married someone else</span>.
</li><li> While there are 3 main paths with their own narratives, <em>Revelation</em> is the only one that actually involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stopping the real villain, Anankos,</span> and uniting the two kingdoms with minimal bloodshed. It also lacks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> with lots of scripted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDeath">Character Deaths</a> in favor of having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> with a very small casualty count, along with it being the only branch where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azura and Lilith live</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Excluding <em>Revelation</em>, the game heavily favors <em>Birthright</em> over <em>Conquest</em>. The Avatar character has a more justified reason for siding with Hoshido, the main antagonist is Garon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>, and the Nohrian siblings are more conflicted about fighting the Avatar than the Hoshidan siblings are in <em>Conquest</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> provides an interesting example.
<ul><li> Of the titular Three Houses, the game pushes the Black Eagles the most for a first playthrough: The prologue has Byleth awakening their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a> powers after they take a blow for Edelgard; shes found right outside the meeting room where Byleth first begins wandering the monastery to make their decision; she is the only lord that can reach an S-Rank with Byleth regardless of their gender; and lastly, the Black Eagles are almost always shown during in-game tutorials. However, the actual Black Eagles route, Crimson Flower, is the one with the fewer amount of story chapters (18), it has the fewest amount of recruitable characters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever">even leaving your party</a></span>) and playable paralogues, most major scenes are shown through CG images rather than animated cutscenes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it deals with "those who slither in the dark" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen">during the credits</a></span>. Not to mention, it's the only route that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">requires the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">fulfill some requisites to unlock it</a>, otherwise, the default <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">story branch</a> for the Black Eagles becomes the Silver Snow path. Said route, while having a higher chapter count (21), more playable characters and paralogues, uses more animated cutscenes and actually deals with TWSITD onscreen, results in losing access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers">Black Eagles's exclusive units (Edelgard, Hubert and Jeritza)</a>, and has its story act as the basis for all three routes where Edelgard is an enemy</span>. Also, the Black Eagles not only have the fewest amount of obtainable Relics (missing the Areadbhar, Crusher, Failnaught, and either Freikugel or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aymr</span>), they happen to lack the chapter "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">Blood of the Eagle and Lion</a>" as well, meaning they will never be able to participate in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Battle at Gronder</a> during Part II as allies unless they're recruited in the other routes.
</li><li> On the other hand, there's the Blue Lions and Golden Deer routes, both which have the most amount of story chapters (22). Blue Lions has access to the most amount of playable characters, paralogues and obtainable Relics and Sacred Weapons (leaving only the Aymr and the Sword of Begalta unobtainable), and a cast that the White Clouds portion seems tailor-made for. But, it comes at the expense of the lore regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seiros and Nemesis being in the background</span>, and leaves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">"those who slither in the dark"</a></span> never directly confronted nor decisively defeated, <em>unless</em> one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> recruits Hapi from the DLC, as several of her epilogues involve her soundly defeating them</span>. By comparison, the Golden Deer route brings proper closure to most of the points the Blue Lions ignores, but at the expense of having Claude as its only exclusive character, only one exclusive paralogue, and having no access to the Relics Areadbhar, Aymr and Crusher.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the H-game <em>Legend of Queen Opala</em>, the good route is the main one, giving you more areas to travel through, chances to fight Sir Edward, and learn more about <em>why</em> Osira is doing what she's doing. The evil route was sort of an afterthought; you get different sex scenes, capture the Queens, and then do the final quest of the Good side in reverse (requiring a lot of grinding just to get out of Osira's palace, which is normally the endgame dungeon), before battling the final boss of Osira's route. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>However</em>, the player can only become Pharaoh on the evil route, through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> method that allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanRuleAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanRuleAlone">betray Osira</a> and claim all three royals as his concubines and party members.</span> The Good route is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">canon for the second game</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The games you can choose to play as either a boy or a girl and choose one of 3 different starters, but promotional material (gameplay trailers, promotional artwork...) often implies that the canon path is the boy choosing the Fire starter in odd-numbered generations <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1evhz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1evhz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1evhz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Charmander, Torchic, Tepig and Litten</span> and the Water one in even-numbered generations <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2i018');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2i018" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2i018');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Totodile, Piplup, Froakie and Sobble</span>. Subverted by the Generation 3 remakes: Judging from both the anime trailer and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGenerations">Pokémon Generations</a></em>, Treecko is the canon choice for the remakes.
</li><li> Also, the promotional artwork for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> have a little inconsistency between them: The promotional artwork for the Ultra Megalopolis shows Elio with a Decidueye, but the one for the Rainbow Rocket Episode gives him a <em>full canon team</em> of Incineroar, Alolan Raichu, Alolan Ninetales, Toucannon, Tsareena and Dusk Lycanroc.
</li><li> Who the girl chooses varies, but it usually depends on the boy's pick and who is the cutest member. Leaf is strongly associated with Squirtle (sometimes Bulbasaur), Kris with Totodile, Lyra with Chikorita, May with Torchic (occasionally Mudkip), Dawn with Piplup, Hilda with Tepig, Rosa with Snivy, Serena with Fennekin and Selene with Rowlet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee">Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!</a></em> have fixed starters as in their respective titles, but promotional material still indulges in a bit of favoritism by featuring the boy character Chase as the canon protagonist of <em>Let's Go! Pikachu</em>, while the female Elaine is canon in <em>Let's Go! Eevee</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiataStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiataStories">Radiata Stories</a></em> has two story routes: The Human side, and the Non-Human side. Of the two, the Non-Human side is unquestionably favored by the writers as it explores the three main protagonists Jack, Ridley, and Gantz in more detail. In comparison, the Human route has Jack stay relatively the same as a character, while Ridley and Gantz have little importance overall. Examples include meeting Gawain, his father's killer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3vp74');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3vp74" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3vp74');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the Human route, Gawain is an antagonist with little depth to him. On the Non-Human route, Gawain's reasons are more explained and detailed, plus he interacts with his son Gantz, and Jack goes through a character arc of understanding Gawain.</span>, and the final boss<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note49ran');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note49ran" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note49ran');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the Human route, Jack fights because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aphelion kills Ridley</span>. In the Non-Human route, Jack fights because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aphelion threatens the world's balance, and also will kill Ridley</span>.</span>. It doesn't help that several plotlines in the game never get resolved or referenced after the split if you go Human route, such as Cross being responsible for the Blood Orc that attacked Ridley (whereas in the Non-Human route, Cross is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Jack). The Non-Human route is also the route where Ridley and Jack hook up, which was a major part of their interactions early on, while the Human route has Jack get with an ally of the players choice. Lastly, it's the only route where Jack can wield the Arbitrator, his father's sword, whereas in the Human route he feels unable to use it. Really, the only significant part of the story that is favored in the Human side is in regards to gameplay; the Human route has some of the most interesting bosses due to fighting two of the Dragons, and overall offering more unique gameplay choices Jack can have.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecordOfAgarestWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecordOfAgarestWar">Record of Agarest War</a></em> runs on a not-at-all-subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">First Girl Wins</a> rule. While the player can choose any of the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interests</a> of each generation or even not be with any, if they fail to charm even one of the ladies, the game pushes and expects you to pick the first girl introduced. They all appear in the opening with wedding dresses, appear in the posters and promotional material, etc. In the first generation, while the girls are asking Leonhardt questions, if he answers that he already has someone he likes, only the first girl gets a bonus, meaning the game assumes that, if you like someone, it's her.

When Sonja gets returned to her own body during postgame, she and Aden start off with Love Points instead of Friendship Points for each other compared to the other love interests. Though the game also implies a B-Choice with Odette. She was the first girl to meet Aden and Sonja on Fenith Island, and she has the most plot-relevance out of the three sisters.

<ul><li> Exaggerated in the very first game in the series with multiple endings, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamiTenseiII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamiTenseiII">Megami Tensei II</a></em>. There, Chaos was the default path and Luficer an outright good guy, while siding with Law was more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiNocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiNocturne">Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne</a></em> didn't have any favoritism in the initial release, but in the Maniax <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport">which was the version released outside Japan</a>) the True Demon Ending, a traditional Chaos path, gets most of the game's additional content, is the only way to face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, and its ending shot forms the basis of the game's title screen. In the Demi-Fiend's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo">Previous Player-Character Cameo</a> in the DLC of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</a></em>, it's explicitly stated he took the TDE path.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a> Overclocked</em>, Amane's route has you act far more moderately than the usual Law route. You consistently prefer to redeem sinners rather than execute them, and no indication is given that humanity has lost its free will. While Naoya's evil route is typical Chaos fare, Naoya's good route has you rally all of Tokyo to stand up to God, leading to you going to Heaven to do battle with Him while all of your friends cheer you on and await your safe return.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> is not as extreme as other games in the series, as all the endings the same length in story time and each one has a relatively decent ending, but the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> ending</span> is quite clearly the favored option by the story. Its the only one where you get almost the entire party (sans one who cannot be recruited except on his route), both sides of the conflict, Yamato and Ronaldo, put aside their differences to work together to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Polaris</span>, and all the characters get happier lives when its over than before. The <em>Record Breaker</em> version even uses it as a rough base for the storyline of its chapter, the only difference being the presence of the entire cast, even the one who normally can not be recruited.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney">Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey</a></em> is the most blatantly pro-Neutral game in the franchise, the <em>Redux</em> rerelease gives three expanded routes that provide some nuance to the Neutral route by revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you only manage to delay the inevitable in the original ending, and have to effectively damn yourself to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> to provide a permanent Neutral solution</span>. Meanwhile, the extended Law route leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you taking away humanity's desire for conflict instead of its free will, creating a world of peace and harmony for all humans</span>, while the extended Chaos route leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you creating a world where all humans have infinite freedom and possibility</span>. Law+ and Chaos+ are also the only routes in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can bring Zelenin and Jimenez, respectively, back from the levels of extremism they reach in all of the other routes</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</a></em> shows its neutral favoritism by making its Law and Chaos endings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFinalBossForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFinalBossForYou">end the plot prematurely</a>. Still, within its neutral branches, it continues to favor the Bonds route as the game regularly praises you for decisions that favor it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em>, or <em>The Second Evolution</em> as it was called in later versions, features two characters to play as: Claude and Rena. While both are of equal importance to the story, Claude has more plot-relevant scenes that are exclusive to him, as well as a familial connection to Ronyx from the first game. Also, both characters can recruit a party member that's exclusive to them, but Dias, who will only permanently join the party if Rena is the protagonist, has no private actions (until the remake, at least), which gives him no further development and makes it excessively hard to see any alternate endings for him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, the ending where your party ends up with Kratos is noticeably less developed than the ending with Zelos. Several sidequests are dependent on Zelos' presence in order to be completed, but there are almost none that are exclusive to Kratos. Kratos also has only a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">alternate costume</a>, while Zelos has several. Additionally, picking Kratos will also automatically set him as Lloyd's soulmate regardless of what everyone's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> are at, forcing you to pick Zelos if you want Lloyd to end up with anyone else. The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a></em>, outright made the ending with Kratos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">non-canon</a> by having Kratos be entirely absent except for a brief cameo.
<ul><li> Also of note is that if you pick the Zelos route, then Kratos still ends up siding with the heroes and playing the same role he does in his own ending, he just never becomes a playable character again for the rest of the playthrough. But if you pick the Kratos route, then Zelos <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out to have been sincere in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and is killed by the party</span>. So the Zelos route is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> in comparison, despite the supposed choice.
</li><li> From the same game any of the party can be chosen as Lloyd's soul mate (not always but often a romantic relationship) based on who has the highest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Affection</a> for Lloyd. However the game favours Colette for this role. While every other party member starts with an Affection score of 0 Colette starts with an Affection score of 500. She also has more chances to increase this score and less chances to reduce it than any other character. Colette also has more scenes alone with Lloyd than the other party members <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the final cutscene is with her and Lloyd even if she isn't his soul mate.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em> has two storylines, Jude's and Milla's. Jude's has far more content, however, while Milla's seems intended for a second playthrough. This is most noticeable at the end of the third act of the game, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Milla is presumed dead.</span> Jude's story goes on to feature a very significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a> fight, followed by a fight with Gaius, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Presa and Agria's</span> deaths, and a three-phase boss fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the real Maxwell</span>. All of this happens offscreen on Milla's path, which instead consists of her wandering through the Spirit World for a while (essentially a very long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">No-Gear Level</a> with her as your sole party member) with very little interaction due to the lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a></span>. While Milla gets her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a> fight, it's an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">frustrating one</a>, and she only comes back during the last phase of Jude's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a>. It's actually not possible to get the "Religious Skit Viewer" trophy on Milla's path, as there simply aren't enough skits for her to see.

<ul><li> While the game attempts to avert this trope by connecting each of the origin stories to the main quest in some fashion, some are still more preferred than others. Of note is the Human Noble, who loses their entire family to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, is the only protagonist who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can possibly become king or queen of Ferelden</span>, and is also the only character that's given any kind of portrayal in the game's promotional material. In a possible effort to make up for the Dalish Elf's lackluster treatment, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> includes a pre-made world state where they are the Warden (alongside a state with the Dwarf Noble and one with, you guessed it, the Human Noble), brings back their specific clan, and even makes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> out of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, in turn, comes with just one default world state starring the Dalish Elf Warden.
</li><li> Played straight with the Landsmeet. While Alistair's fate is determined by player choices there, post-<em>Origins</em> he's portrayed as the sole ruler of Ferelden in supplemental materials, and King Alistair gets more content in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> cameo than either Warden Alistair or Drunk!Alistair. By contrast, if Anora remains queen at the Landsmeet (either on her own or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">married to him</a>), she she'll get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in the sequels (along with Loghain if he survived <em>Origins</em>), and isn't seen again until a very small cameo in <em>Inquisition</em>. That game zig zags it though: King Alistair only makes the same very small cameo (though he's also referenced more in codex entries and incidental NPC chatter than Anora), while Warden Alistair has a substantial role in one of the main plot lines. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It comes at the cost of the player having to choose between saving him and their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> PC in the Fade.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game clearly favors choosing Mages over Templars. Meredith is antagonistic for the entire game, committing acts that can be hard to find any justification for behind her own paranoia, while her Mage counterpart Orsino is presented as a reasonable figure who tries to help maintain peace in the city and only steps to confront Meredith after she has begun to slip into total insanity, with his possible bad deeds almost tacked-on at the end, namely that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he knew the mage who killed Hawke's mother</span>. Meanwhile, the ending cinematic outright calls you a <em>tyrant</em> for siding with the Templars and supplementary material almost always assumes you sided with the mages. Your siblings reflect this as well. If Bethany is alive and joins the Circle, she is happy to finally have a place to both learn magic, and not feel ashamed of having it after years of being on the wrong, which makes her far more relatable as a character. If Carver is alive and joins the Templars, he is not happy at all since it means going against his family, and becoming something that nearly ruined his family when they were younger, which pales in comparison to his attitude if he is made a Grey Warden, where, unlike Bethany, he is happy and feels glad to have a noble motivation. Then there's the slant on the "Champion of Kirkwall" codex entry in <em>Inquisition,</em> where if you sided with the mages, it consists of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> explaining to his fellow templars that Hawke had good reasons to oppose Meredith and essentially justifies doing so. Meanwhile if you sided with the templars, it consists of an enchanter telling her fellow mages that it's a good thing Hawke won't be at the Conclave given that they helped with the "systematic slaughter of all of Kirkwall's mages". Its jarring since the entire point of the conflict was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>, but the series is really one-sided about executing it.
</li><li> Most quests have hidden options that can be unlocked depending on the companions you brought. Of all the companions, Anders is the one with the most unique and story-changing scenes. For example, bringing him to the Deep Roads mission is the only way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turn your sibling into a Grey Warden</span>. Others scenes include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">temporarily curing Bartrand of his insanity</span> (which throws that entire situation into a new light), becoming possessed by Justice while in the fade, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost falling under the influence of Corypheus</span> in the <em>Legacy</em> DLC. To top it all off, as a mage, Anders also has almost every special option that Bethany and Merrill have.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a slight inclination in the main game to side with the rebel mages over the Templars in the first act, influenced by a number of factors:
</li><li> Each path includes the early introduction of a potential companion, but Dorian appears in the lead-up to the mage path and is more deeply invested in the story, even becoming a required member of the Inquisitor's party. If you learn of the mage's situation and side with the Templars anyway then Dorian can eventually be recruited...but he'll start off with negative approval. Cole on the other hand only makes himself known after you've committed to recruiting the Templars, acts as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> rather than a full companion, and his approval takes no hit if you side with the mages instead.
</li><li> The leadup to the mage quest (In Hushed Whispers) has considerably more weight and urgency than the leadup to the Templar quest (Champions of the Just). You can meet Dorian without ever actually committing to the mage path, and you are introduced to Alexius' use of time magic that threatens to tear the universe apart, the Tevinter occupation of Redcliffe, and the rebel mages being conscripted into the Tevinter army on Fereldan soil. Meanwhile, the extent of the Templar introduction is the Lord Seeker being a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist">punching out a cleric in Val Royeaux</a>, with no indication beyond a few words from Cassandra that this is anything to really worry about in the face of the Breach.
</li><li> The mobs found throughout the game later will always be full of Red Templars no matter what you do, and the game's later events carry considerably more weight when the knowledge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s next move comes from a trip to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> showing you the full impact of his plans as opposed to the demon ramblings found in the Templar stronghold.
</li><li> It decides the fate of Grand Enchanter Fiona, a returning character from the novels (and secretly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Alistair's mother</span>), either having her join you in the Mage path or killing her as a minor boss with almost no dialog in the Templar path.
</li><li> There is significantly more special content for a Dalish Inquisitor than there is for any other background. Which isn't surprising given how much of the plot explores elvish history. Solas especially is much more open and straightforward with an Elf, and his romance is the only one that only one race can pursue. Plus an elf gets to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> yell a lot when they meet two of their gods and find out that their entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong">Religion Is Wrong</a></span>, which is nice. In addition, being a female elf also means you have the most romantic options available to you than any other race/gender combo in the game, as you get access to Blackwall, Solas, Sera, Iron Bull, Cullen, and Josephine.
</li><li> The <em>Trespasser</em> DLC favors saving the Bull's Chargers by sacrificing the Qunari dreadnought, rather than the other way round. If the Chargers are alive, you get extra scenes with them and Iron Bull. If they're dead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iron Bull sides with the invading Qunari and you kill him</span>, and that's it.

It delves deep into their culture, allows the player to join factions that typically only make sense for a Dunmer to be a part of (such as the Tribunal Temple), and even includes more faces than the other racial options. The story also has the player effectively assuming the role as the reincarnation of an ancient Chimer hero, and while it's deliberately left ambiguous how true that is, it would certainly make the most sense for it to be a Dark Elf. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> considering the game takes place in the Dunmer homeland.

However, because it explores Nordic culture, gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Thu'um</a>, which lore-wise has always been associated with the Nords, and depicted the Dragonborn as a burly Nord warrior on all the promotional material, there's no mistake as to which race the game is kind of expecting you to play as. Furthermore, some races, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiit</a>, are subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and not allowed into some cities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">but the player is inexplicably free of such restrictions</a>.
<ul><li> Inverted in the case of the Bretons. They are uniquely largely free of any racial pros or cons due to story or unique dialogue. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> hate them, but no one thinks anything special of them either, aside from two instances in the entire game: a quest where players replace a reclusive chef that is a master of Breton cuisine (the original is an Orc, but as no one knows this, your assistant for the quest casually remarks that of course you're a Breton, what else could you be!) and having average ability to disguise themselves as a Thalmor. (Being humans with Elvish ancestors allows them to pass for an elf at a distance as long as their hood is up)

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, the player can potentially reach Made Man status with any of the four crime families in New Reno. However, only by accepting the second quest from the Wright family can the Sierra Army Depot even be placed on your map. This is one of the best locations to find advanced weapons and armor mid-game, as well as a potential companion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> allows for four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionSpecificEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionSpecificEndings">Faction-Specific Endings</a>: either Caesar's Legion, Mr. House, the NRC or the Courier him/herself will dominate the Mojave in the aftermath of the game. Unfortunately for a player interested in being openly anti-NCR and/or pro-Legion, however, there are a ton of NCR quests and locations (which can still be played if youre siding with House or going alone), but only a small handful of Legion equivalents. You can play as someone explicitly opposed to the NCR, but the cost is that a very large portion of the game's content will be closed to you, including potentially all of the game's human companions. Theres also very little in-story reason for why the Courier would <em>want</em> to support the Legion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">especially if theyre female</a>, given how relentlessly brutal and evil the Legion is depicted as being. A big part of this is due to content being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">there was meant to be many more Legion-friendly locations, characters, and quests</a>, and the Legion was intended to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient">good points of their own</a> that showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">the conflict is far from black and white</a>. Most of this ended up being cut due to time and budget restraints, leaving the Legion looking like cartoonishly evil caricatures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">what they were intended to be</a>.
<ul><li> This favoritism is made especially obvious in the DLC Honest Hearts. Of the three major tribes in Zion, the White Legs are the ones allied with Caesar's Legion...and they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardCodedHostility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardCodedHostility">immediately try to kill you throughout the DLC regardless of your relationship with Caesar</a>, forcing you to look to the other two tribes for allies. The remaining two tribes are led by men opposed to the Legion, and both are treated as storyline-critical characters whose deaths end all further quests in the DLC and result in the worst ending. The only way to do the storyline "properly" involves fighting against a Legion ally.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shepard is often portrayed in the default Soldier class, which by the game's own lore makes the most sense in explaining their prowess in combat. This is particularly true in the first game where it is hard to justify how Shepard can match an Asari in biotic power or a Quarian engineer in tech skills.
</li><li> Liara T'Soni is the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">Love Interest</a> who can be romanced in all three games (though <em>2</em> requires DLC for this), by both genders, and cannot die under any circumstances except for low-EMS ending of the final installment.
</li><li> It makes much more sense story-wise to complete Noveria last since Virmire is added as an emergency mission after completing two storyline missions, also the piece of intel gathered in Noveria (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the location of the Mu relay</span>) would narrow down tremendously the location of the Conduit (this can be handwaved by saying that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Mu relay transports to many systems</span>, but it is clear that with a little extra research they would have been able to deduce the location eventually.)
</li><li> The angry, accusatory attitude of the Virmire Survivor towards Shepard on Horizon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> makes much more sense coming from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ashley</span> (the pessimist who doubts first before she even gives anything a chance) than it does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaidan</span> (the optimist who trusts first and doubts later).
</li><li> However, this situation is muddled in the third game. Saving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaidan</span> will result to much more conversation between him and Shepard after the Citadel coup about how he was wrong and ready to make amend, wondering if Cerberus still has some good people, many interaction and jokes between him and fellow Normandy squadmates as well as a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> with him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Gay Option</a> for a male Shepard. Saving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ashley</span> would just result with many insult and doubt from her before the Citadel coup and she only interacted with two squadmates in the Normandy including Shepard. The change in the head writer and effort to promote Kaidan as a legitimately gay male love interest (something which the fanbase complained about the game's reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountLesbians">Discount Lesbians</a>) probably explained this.
</li><li> In <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, during Samara's loyalty mission, you can choose to kill Samara and recruit her target Morinth if you want to and Morinth will be a loyal squad mate for the rest of the game. The favoritism doesn't show up until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>. If Samara survives her loyalty mission and the suicide mission, then in <em>ME3</em> she will show up when you do the Ardat-Yakshi Monastery mission and will make it a much more meaningful experience. If Morinth survives said events in <em>ME2</em>, all you get is an email from her at the beginning of <em>ME3</em>, and then during the final mission, you fight her as a Banshee, kill her, and move on.
</li><li> The early Freedom's Progress mission in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> has the player choose between turning Veetor over to either Cerberus or Tali. If you choose Tali, Veetor shows up at Tali's loyalty mission later to help the two of you out. If you choose Cerberus, the Veetor subplot basically ends right there; Shepard loses much rapport with his/her longtime partner Tali, and over nothing, since Veetor's interrogation at the hands of Cerberus fails to turn up any useful information.
</li><li> One of the selling points of the second game was that, in the ending suicide mission, anyone in your squad was able to die, ranging all over the spectrum from almost everyone dying to everyone surviving. However, keeping squad members alive near-universally results in better outcomes in the third game. Living squad members enhance the story a bit, keep minor characters in sidequests alive, and sometimes open up otherwise-impossible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">third options</a>. In particular, it's impossible to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make peace between the Geth and the Quarians</span> if either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tali</span> or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legion</span> dies in the suicide mission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>: Youre given the choice of whether to side with Sloane Kelly or Reyes Vidal in the conflict over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Kadara Port</a>...but theres literally no reason given for why you would ever genuinely want to side with Kelly, as shes a brutal, tyrannical, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who never shows anything but disdain for Ryder and the Initiative, while also forcing them to pay to settle on Kadara and letting criminals run wild. Contrast that with Reyes, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodGangster">Friendly Neighborhood Gangster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> who is not only unerringly helpful and friendly to Ryder, but also makes peace with the Initiative and actually puts some effort into cleaning up Kadara if chosen. Siding with Reyes also leads to significantly more poignant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for Ryder, not to mention hes a potential romance option. As if it wasnt any clearer who the writers expected you to choose, the only way to really side with Kelly is to click <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">an easily missed button prompt</a>; otherwise all you have to do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">sit back and enjoy the cutscene</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Hong Kong</em> campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowrunReturns">Shadowrun Returns</a></em>, you can play any sort of character you like and resolve your missions through either violence or diplomacy. However, dialogue with Duncan, your character's stepbrother, indicates that he or she was always the calmer and more intelligent of the two in the past, implying that the game is expecting you to play as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRenegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRenegades">Star Renegades</a></em> allows the player to end the game with any five characters, plus their assistant drone. However, the game highly recommends using Wynn Syphex until your first success, due to her being the focus of both the intro and tutorial, an extra scene at the end of a successful run will be skipped entirely if she isn't present, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the default final boss is an evil alternate-dimension version of her brother</span>.

</li><li> While there are several possible ways for the first boss fight to go, the game, through its tutorials and mechanics, heavily nudges the player into accidentally killing Toriel, then re-loading and sparing her, as this leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> right afterwards that reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Flowey knows about your ability to SAVE and re-load, and that SAVING is an in-story concept as well as a game mechanic.</span>

Siding with either Lacroix or Ming Xiao nets you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> little more than two different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Overs</a> </span>. Siding with the Camarilla is available, but since your main contacts with the Camarilla consist of Lacroix (who is actively trying to get you killed) and Strauss (who is pleasant enough, but doesn't do very much in the game and comes across as a bit condescending), the justifications for doing so aren't particularly strong. The Anarchs, by contrast, save your life repeatedly and allow you an abundance of opportunities for helpful interaction, beginning with Smiling Jack guiding you through the tutorial. Finally, only the Anarch and Independent endings allow you to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> properly savor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Lacroix's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> when he opens the sarcophagus.</span> It isn't difficult to decipher which faction the developers were expecting most people to side with. Things do get a little more even (but only a little) if you play a Tremere character, as Strauss (a Tremere himself) has a bit more advice and gives you a nice apartment to live in<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5wiwq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5wiwq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5wiwq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">other Clans get another apartment from Lacroix, but where Strauss' help has strong overtones of 'I believe it would be useful to be your ally' Lacroix' is more 'I have to do this for political reasons'</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> splits into three distinct paths mid-game, one for the Order and the Scoia'tael and a neutral one. The latter features more content and is actually harder to unlock. This is justified by the eponymous Witchers' code, which forbids them from taking sides in conflicts—so the neutral path makes the most sense in-story.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2AssassinsOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2AssassinsOfKings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a></em> splits into two paths that depend on who Geralt allies with for the rest of the game: Vernon Roche and the Blue Stripes, or Iorveth and the Scoia'tael. While both have the same amount of content, the latter goes into greater detail on things that tie into the Kingslayer plot, including the dragon, the Lodge of Sorceresses, and Philippa Eilhart. Roche's path leaves the player in the dark on these matters. On the other hand, Roche comes back for a rather large subplot in the next game, while Iorveth is never seen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>: For players just entering the franchise at the third instalment, Yennifer of Vengeberg can seem like a forced love interest, constantly belittling Geralt and making you wonder what they ever saw in each other. You can later meet and romance Triss, but on subsequent meetings with Yen there is no option to break it off with her (until much later). Other NPCs also ask about Yen and continue to assume you are together, and no option is given for you to correct them. Triss also gets far fewer lines with Geralt, often just a "huh" or "yes", and she doesn't show up at Kaer Morhen until much later. Of course, Yen is the canonical love interest in the books, so it's somewhat understandable. On the other hand, one must romance Triss in order to unlock the Full Crew achievement for getting all of your main allies together to Kaer Morhen, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she will leave with the other mages at the end of her story arc for good</span> if you don't.
<ul><li> In the <em>Blood and Wine</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, the player takes one of two distinct routes to end the game with. In one, Geralt can make contact with the Unseen Elder, a powerful vampire lord whose authority over all vampires can be used to bring the raging Dettlaff directly to Geralt so that the Witcher can stop his rampage once and for all. In the other, Geralt can journey to the Land of a Thousand Fables and rescue Sylvia Anna, whose past relationship with Dettlaff is hoped will bring him to heel. Both paths are fully realized, but the latter is the only way to really learn about Sylvia's past and motivations, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and taking it is the only way to get the campaign's best ending</span>. Even in-game, Geralt is repeatedly told this is the more preferable path to take, and is given multiple opportunities to change his mind if he opts for the Unseen Elder.

Those extensions had the Horde content developed first (<em>confirmed by the developers to be true for at least Cataclysm)</em>, and most of the overarching plot is that of the Horde facing internal strife and being led by an evil Warchief.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/BadAppleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/BadAppleWars">Bad Apple Wars</a></em> has both the Good Apple and the Bad Apple routes, which are centered around either obeying or rebelling against the rules, respectively. As you can guess from the title, the Bad Apple route was given far more attention than the Good Apple one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay">Choices: Stories You Play</a></em>: While the writers did a good job of avoiding this trope in main storylines, the same cannot be said for love interests. Some of them have more screen time, are more relevant to their respective book's main plot and have more Premium (or even <em>free</em>) interactions than the others. Examples include:
<ul><li> Book 1 of <em>The Freshman</em> strongly steers the player toward Chris, to the point that the narrative treats you as if you're in relationship with him even if you have no interest in dating him at all. However, the book does eventually start giving the other love interests some focus and things do become more balanced overall.
</li><li> Dom Hunter/Kenna Rys from <em>The Crown and the Flame</em>, with both of them being protagonists. However, this is downplayed, as the other love interests have major roles in the story with completely free character arcs and interactions, with two of them (Raydan and Val) being playable for several chapters for free.
<ul><li> Non-love interest wise, the story clearly favors <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing off Marco</span> since it is not only locked behind a Prestige requirement, you have extra scenes with other characters (most notably Luther, Zenobia and Diavolos) discussing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his death</span> and the decision to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spare him</span> has virtually no impact on the plot.
</li></ul></li><li> Dave Reyes from <em>Most Wanted</em>, because he's the co-protagonist and because his developing relationship with Sam is vital to the main plot.
</li><li> Mark Collins from <em>Love Hacks</em> Book 1, being the protagonist's long time friend and playable character; the other love interests, Ben and Leah, do not officially join the core group until Book 2.
</li><li> Kenji/Talos from <em>Hero</em>, with Grayson being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> and Eva/Minuet being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with Hayden Young from <em>Perfect Match</em>. He/She has the most free romantic interaction and scenes with Kai compared to Sloane and Damien, but has less plot relevance than Damien until Hayden's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal">Robotic Reveal</a></span>.
</li><li> Adrian Raines from <em>Bloodbound</em>. Not only does he have the most screen time and free romantic interaction with Amy, he also plays a role in the other love interests' (Jax and Lily) storylines (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Kamilah</a>, who is a supporting character in <em>his</em> storyline instead).
</li><li> <em>Endless Summer</em>: It is far easier to build a relationship with Jake than the other love interests purely due to the large number of choices affecting your status with him.
<ul><li> Non-love interest-wise, the ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you merge with Vaanu</span> is generally considered to be the "correct" ending, as while it is certainly bittersweet, it provides the most logical and narratively appropriate resolution to the events of the story; the ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you allow Rourke to win</span> seems artificially constructed to be as harsh as possible (in addition to retconning the events of the story out of existence), and the ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you and your friends stay on the island while the rest of the world is destroyed</span> feels unsatisfying and hollow.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>High School Story</em> Book 1 gives you a lot of time with Emma and Caleb in the beginning, though they are quickly reduced to almost background characters while Michael and Maria start carrying more of the plot and in the later books. Aiden is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> if you do not join the band.
</li><li> Eleanor Waverly from <em>The Haunting Of Braidwood Manor</em>, with the other love interest Victor barely having any screen time that isn't a Premium choice.
</li><li> <em>Red Carpet Diaries</em>: Matt gets considerably more focus and screen time than the other love interests. This is especially notable in Book 2 because he is the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> that is in the production of your new movie. Also in Book 2, Seth and Teja's roles are limited to a minor subplot, while Victoria has no role in the story at all apart from brief scenes of emotional support. By the last third of Book 2, Thomas Hunt receives the lion's share of screen time as soon as he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">Promoted to Love Interest</a>.
</li><li> <em>Veil of Secrets</em> strongly favors Flynn by giving him a personal stake in the story (he's Kate's brother) and essentially making him your partner/sidekick in the investigation of Kate's disappearance even if you insist on him staying out of your way.
</li><li> Non-love interest-wise, <em>It Lives In The Woods</em> clearly favors the decision to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">let Noah take over as Redfield</span> since it requires Noah to have high Nerve score, and because the ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span> draws very little reaction from the other characters. The sequel gives Tom three extra nerve points if you made the favored decision. The next chapter after that gives Tom +5 if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Devon is alive</span> and -5 if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Noah is alive.</span>
</li><li> Prince <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(later King)</span> Liam from <em>The Royal Romance</em>, who is the entire reason you entered the plot in the first place. He is also the only character who is in love with you regardless of your choice for a Love Interest.
</li><li> <em>America's Most Eligible</em> favors Adam over the other love interests because he's the easiest one to build up a relationship with, both in terms of having more chances in general to interact with him as well as there being a wider variety of dialogue options which earn you points with him. Additionally, paying the premium option to read his diary reveals that he is deeply in love with you.
</li><li> <em>Big Sky Country</em> focuses on Sawyer Oakley more than the other three love interests because you live on his ranch and get to know him fairly well for free while the others force you to pay diamonds to get to know them better.
</li><li> <em>High School Story: Class Act</em> favors Rory over Ajay and Skye because Bailey is hinted to have a crush on Rory since childhood, not to mention the excessive amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> that Rory gets.
</li><li> <em>It Lives Beneath</em> favors Tom because he has been conducting his own investigations into the mysteries of Pine Springs and he is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> from <em>It Lives In The Woods</em>.
</li><li> <em>The Elementalists</em> forces Beckett on the player at most opportunities, even if the player took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">option not to romance men</a>.
</li><li> <em>A Courtesan Of Rome</em> initially forces Syphax on the player and much of the plot revolves around the relationship between himself and Arin, having similar backgrounds as non-Romans forced into Rome's service, being her bodyguard for eight years, and fully supporting her vendetta against those responsible for destroying her village and selling her into slavery. The dialogue also implies that the two of them have been intimate even if the player isn't romancing him. Later chapters shift the focus to Cassius Longinus and Marc Antony because they're both important figures in Republican Roman politics. Sabina, on the other hand, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for most of the time, and her scenes tend to be heavily paywalled.
</li><li> Non-love interest wise <em>The Heist: Monaco</em> seems to favor you recruiting premium crew members Lena Ortiz, Niles "Eddie Quick" Edison, and Miranda Moreau due to them unlocking bonus scenes and advantages in the story.
</li><li> <em>Home for the Holidays</em> favors Nick Peralta, whom Scarlett accompanies throughout his stay in Winter Haven, over Wyatt Hart and Holly Wright.
</li><li> <em>Ride or Die: A Bad Boy Romance</em> forces Logan on the player, because he introduces Ellie to the world of Street Racing. A lot of characters assume that they are in a relationship and he is the only love interest with premium scenes for the first <em>five</em> chapters.
</li><li> Downplayed with Ernest Sinclaire in <em>Desire &amp; Decorum</em>. While all love interests have significant amounts of free screen time and relevance to the story, Ernest stands out the most because he's the only one who already has a personal grudge against Duke Richards and is the kind of suitor Regency society would approve for Clara (male, white, British, high society).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em> favors Nagisa's route. Completing all routes for the first part of the game unlocks the second part (<em>After Story</em>), which is a continuation of Nagisa's route.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> plays this interestingly in that the game has three <em>completely</em> distinct routes (Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, Heaven's Feel), each with its own heroine (Saber, Rin, Sakura). However, Unlimited Blade Works is inaccessible until you've completed Fate first (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag">Event Flag</a> that branches between them simply doesn't happen on your first play-through) and Heaven's Feel is similarly inaccessible until you've completed Unlimited Blade Works, meaning you <em>have</em> to play through them in a fixed order, causing the overall story to evolve and get deeper as you play through and learn more and more. As a result, while Saber is only the main heroine of Fate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">killed off</a> <em>shockingly</em> early in the story in Heaven's Feel)</span>, she's usually considered the "main heroine" of the game, if not the entire <em>Fate</em> franchise (indeed, the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDEEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDEEN">Studio DEEN</a> <em>Fate/stay night</em> anime adaptation was primarily based on the Fate route).
<ul><li> Another factor is that the novel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">takes advantage</a> of this setup, with UBW and Heaven's Feel assuming the player already has knowledge and context from previous routes - in fact, many of the biggest twists come from subverting what they player has come to expect. This makes Fate and its heroine Saber by <em>far</em> the easiest route to adapt to another medium, as the other two stories require additional exposition to be retrofitted into the narrative just to give an uninitiated viewer the faintest chance of following the plot. This is probably why the DEEN anime was able to be released just 2 years after the VN came out, but <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightUnlimitedBladeWorks">10 years to get a proper adaptation</a>, and <em>Heaven's Feel</em> took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightHeavensFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FateStayNightHeavensFeel">even longer.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Unusually for a visual novel of its length, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Flowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Flowers">Flowers</a></em> only features two routes for each of its games, one of which is much longer and more developed than the other - this serves as the canonical ending coming into the next game. The first game, ~ le volume sur printemps ~, takes it to a new level - not only does one ending make far less sense than the other (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after literally forcing Suou to date her by threatening to blackmail Mayuri, it feels a little odd seeing Rikka get the girl</span>), the flower which serves as a choice indicator gradually grows and blooms if you pick choices for the canonical route, while it <em>shrinks back and reverts back to a seed</em> if you pick the 'wrong' answers.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FragmentsNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FragmentsNote">Fragment's Note</a></em>, Mischa's and Haya's routes are practically identical, with only a few names and a few select scenes swapped. On the contrary, Eri's route is longer and comes with more character development and impactful scenes, and provides more character development for both her and Yukitsuki.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ThePiratesFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ThePiratesFate">The Pirate's Fate</a></em> averts this with most routes, though four of them (as of the current version) have epilogues that expand on the consequences of your actions, instead of ending with merely a bit of narration. Additionally, if Mila stubbornly refuses to join the crew of the Pirate's Fate at the very beginning, it leads to a <em>very</em> short route where she is thrown from the ship, rescued by a pair of mermaids, and only has one choice that determines what the ending is. Either she befriends the younger mermaid (becoming a mermaid herself so that the two of them can keep each other company while ignoring what goes on above the surface) or sides with the older mermaid (letting herself be transformed into a gigantic, vengeful sea monster that goes on a rampage against all pirates). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulFailure">Neither of these endings include the credits</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG">Spirit Hunter: NG</a></em>:
<ul><li> Downplayed with the first two chapters; you can take either Kaoru or Seiji with you during the Urashima Woman and Kubitarou cases, but the former favors Kaoru and her spiritual prowess (and, in fact, cannot be completed unless Kaoru is the companion character), while the latter favors Seiji and his more practical skills.
</li><li> At the end of the Kubitarou case, you can choose to save Seiji or Kaoru from a lightning strike; whoever is saved gets an optional scene with Akira later. Seiji's scene not only contains a unique CG, but also a whole vocal performance of Momo Kuruse's song by Seiji's VA.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WhiteAlbum2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WhiteAlbum2">White Album 2</a></em>, while Maruto (the scenario writer) and Leaf are quiet at what the "canon" plot is supposed to be, players of the games seem to favor the timeline that leads from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Setsuna's route in Concluding Chapter, to Kazusa's True End in Coda</span>. Not only due to the incredibly cathartic nature of the latter, but because it's counterpart was just <em>too perfect</em> and involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Haruki being reduced to a supporting role</a>.
</li><li> In Chapter 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YourTurnToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YourTurnToDie">Your Turn to Die</a></em>, there are two situations in which you have to decide between the lives of two characters: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Reko Yabusame</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Alice Yabusame</a></span> in the former, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Kanna Kizuchi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Sou Hiyori</a></span> in the latter.

You'd <em>expect</em> it to be Shizuku, considering how much the game pushes her as the main character, and her making the MC her blood-bound servant to save his life in the intro, which is something she can only do once in her incredibly long lifespan. It turns out that it's not her, but Shion, the character with barely any ties to the plot and has by far the hardest route to enter.

While playing through all four Episodes is required to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, Episode BlazBlue is the only branch that can be used to reach it, is the only branch to give the context behind the story, and is the only branch that has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> in the first place. While Episode RWBY at least has a good ending (if you ignore the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">ambiguous fates of everyone else</a>), Episode Persona only ever ends on a punchline at their series' expense, and Episode Under-Night is given the outright worst ending in the game (especially after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Episode Extra</a> took place after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> of Episode BlazBlue).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis">Dino Crisis</a></em> has three endings that depend what final choice you make and what approach you use to get to the final area. Stopping Gail from leaving and then going after Dr. Kirk yourself has Regina capture the doctor and everyone escaping together. Choosing to stop Gail from going after Dr. Kirk and then meeting up with Gail and Rick at the boat puts you at the ending where the heroes escape through a cavern on the boat. Choosing to go after the doctor will have you finding Gail giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a> about the true purpose of their mission (capture Dr. Kirk to grill him about his Third Energy research as a potential weapon for the government) before succumbing to his wounds.

Regina then meets up with Rick and they escape the facility with the doctor in tow. The ending where Gail dies had more story detail put into it, though Capcom never stated which ending is the canonical one and the sequel doesn't address it either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em> heavily implies that Ellen is the canon bachelorette by having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ellen's death</span> only occur if you marry her. The Japan-only strategy guide (which features a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">extra tidbits not found in the game</a>) also confirms that Pete marries Ellen.

It doesn't help that it's incredibly easy to get her to like you because she gains love points when you <em>buy seeds from Vesta's farm</em>. Despite this, the Wiiware spinoff title implies that Mark married Muffy and has a son with her.

</li><li> The <em>Pure-Blooded Thief</em> ending from <em>Infiltrating the Airship</em> has only 3 possible branches in <em>Completing the Mission</em> compared to 4 branches for each of the other 3 <em>Airship</em> endings. This is because <em>Pure-Blooded Thief</em> is the only <em>Airship</em> ending in which Henry didn't side with the Government or Toppat Clan and thus it wouldn't make logical sense for <em>Pure-Blooded Thief</em> to continue into <em>Fleeing the Complex</em>'s Government-based or Toppat-based endings. It's also the only <em>Airship</em> ending that doesn't have a 6-choices-long path (each <em>Mission</em> path has between 3 and 6 choices, so 6 choices is the maximum number for one) in <em>Mission</em>, whereas the other 3 <em>Airship</em> endings each have one.

If you choose to Sacrifice Arcadia Bay, Max and Chloe watch as the tornado destroys the town, they drive through it and exit to parts unknown, and that's it - it's much shorter in content, and it doesn't tell players anything about who survived the storm. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that the ambiguity about who survived and where Max and Chloe go next is intentional, and it's up to the players to decide those things for themselves.

<ul><li> Despite this, it's the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifice Arcadia Bay</span> ending that got a spinoff comic, rather than the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifice Chloe</span> ending, and both endings can be referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange2">Life Is Strange 2</a></em>, meaning they weren't lying when they said it was for a pragmatic reason rather than true favoritism.

In Ending B, both Otacon and Meryl's character developments are finished off better (with Otacon rising to his role as Snake's equal, and the truth behind Meryl's background being revealed), and Snake's is more interesting as he is allowed to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">visible breakdown</a> after Meryl's death which Otacon has to talk him out of. Snake and Otacon's conversation is more plot-relevant, focusing on their feelings about the events that have happened, their career plans, and their feelings about Naomi, while Snake and Meryl instead talk about their newfound love and think about the beauty of Alaska. The plot even makes somewhat more sense, as in Ending B, the implication is that Liquid attached Meryl's corpse to a fake bomb and posed her to make sure she seems alive, but in Ending A Snake merely goes to Meryl and the bomb is forgotten about. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> item Otacon gives to Snake is <em>significantly</em> more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">powerful</a> than Meryl's, which is nearly useless. While it is by no means a universal opinion, even fans of Meryl and the games' continuity tend to remark that Ending B is a better ending for the game, with a more bittersweet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalTorque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalTorque">emotional</a> tone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> apparently thought so as well, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> borrows much more from Ending B than from Ending A, omitting Meryl and having Snake and Otacon's Ending B realization that they are meant to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">take a trip to Jupiter</a>" as part of the unspoken backstory.

(A joke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>, for those who don' know) The four ritual items needed for the Rebirth ending are also required for a 10-Star rank, giving that ending slightly more weight than the others.

Back in the real world, both manifestations of Walter's spirit have entered Room 302; and while little Walter is off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">hugging the furniture</a>, adult Walter just stands there, left to wonder<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThatGlitters">Is this it?</a></em> In the background of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityHurts">disappointment of this eternity</a>, a radio news anchor confirms the deaths of Eileen and Henry; announces that Frank the superintendent has also been found dead; and adds that all surviving tenants of the South Ashfield Heights apartment complex have been rushed to the hospital, complaining of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImHavingSoulPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImHavingSoulPains">severe chest pains</a>just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItAllBegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItAllBegan">ten years ago</a>.</span> Contrast the other three endings, in which either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eileen and Henry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">make it out together</a></span>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eileen and Henry make it out together, but she <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">somehow</a></em> wants to return to the cursed apartment building (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteBackToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteBackToNormal">very much still cursed</a>)</span>; or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Henry gets out alone</a> and is left to mourn Eileen's death, confirmed by the same radio anchor as in "21 Sacraments"</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> series, you can choose your gender, but promotional material and even some in-game lore always suggests that the female Inkling/Octoling was the canon heroine of any given story campaign.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIWingsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIWingsOfLiberty">Starcraft II Wings Of Liberty</a></em> does a good job avoiding favoritism on the first two times you have to make a choice, it definitely drops the ball the third time. Before the final mission, you're given the option to disable either the Zerg's Nydus Worms, or deprive them of their air force. The former mission involves taking Raynor and other three heroes, all with unique abilities, through Char's underground cave network, battling zergs in a rather imaginative scenarios, ending with a challenging boss fight, while enjoying plenty of fun banter from the heroes. The latter mission is a rather dull "destroy all bases" macro mission with hardly any dialogue, with only an optional boss to spice things up. Though, ironically, while the first mission is way more fun, the benefits of doing the second mission are <em>much</em> greater.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> While both Chris and Jill's scenarios in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> are pretty fleshed out, their partner characters aren't developed equally. Jill gets Barry, who is established as married man with two daughters, acts a bit strange throughout the adventure, and the source of Barry's strange behavior is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Wesker</a> blackmailing him by using his family as hostages. Should Barry die, he leaves behind a tear jerking letter addressed to his family. Barry can also potentially save Jill twice (from the ceiling trap and cutting the fight against Plant 42 short). Barry also has many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">cheesy lines</a> that make his character stand out more. Meanwhile, Chris gets Rebecca, whose only memorable moment is her being attacked by a Hunter and being killed by it if you don't save her in time. Unlike Barry's death, Rebecca's death scene has Chris react in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">goofy way</a> and then quickly gets over it. While Rebecca is playable twice in Chris's story, she has far less screen time than Barry and has a sparse background which only establishes her as being an accomplished medic at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">18 years old.</a> When it comes to finding Enrico, he tells Jill that someone is betraying their team and then he gets shot for his trouble. When Chris finds him, Enrico accuses him of being a double crosser before being shot by the actual traitor, which gives nothing for Chris to go on. The remake keeps these elements pretty much the same with less narm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> slightly favors the Claire A/Leon B story where Sherry gets infected with the G-Virus and thus Claire has to find a cure. In Leon's story, Ada and Leon grow a bit close together throughout the game and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">dies in Leon's arms</a> near the end. In the reversed scenarios, Ada dangles over a ledge and Leon's strength gives out, causing her to fall into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> while Leon curses Umbrella for causing the whole mess before he throws the G-Virus sample into the pit. Claire's story is even less fleshed out since nothing major happened other than the two of them being stalked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Mr. X</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em> only has slight variations to certain cutscenes, but some of them are more fleshed out than others. In the town's pharmaceutical building, a dying mercenary is encountered and either Nicolai or Carlos kill him. If Nicolai kills him, Jill is left wondering why he'd kill a still conscious man while Nicolai justifies it by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee">he was infected</a> and killing him now would save him a few bullets later. if Carlos kills the man, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">unloads an entire magazine from his assault rifle</a> into him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">though he did ask to be killed before turning</a>) before running off. Depending on how you approach the hospital later on, you either encounter a mercenary that foreshadows Nicoali's betrayal or you run into Nicolai who shoots the man and is about to shoot Carlos before the mercenary unpins a grenade in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">last ditch attempt to get back at Nicolai</a>. Nicoali's final cutscenes are more fleshed out if he gets to explain his motives, but in the scene where he shoots at Jill from his helicopter, he won't talk if you decide to shoot the chopper down.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> 4</em> via over-promising in the advertising. Supposedly players would be allowed to choose whether to stay loyal to the Terran Confederation or jump ship and ally themselves with the Border Worlds. In practice, attempting to stick with Confed past a certain point would spawn a never-ending supply of Border World bombers, and a insultingly short ending sequence once they inevitably killed you.
