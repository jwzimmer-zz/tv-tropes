<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
<ul><li> Certain details introduced early in the series are drifted into something else by the time the manga ends. Rukia originally states that Shinigami kill Hollows from behind to avoid seeing their human faces, but when Shinigami finally enter the story, most Shinigami never kill Hollows that way. Shinigami were designed before the military structure was decided upon, so Ukitake's first appearance doesn't include a captain's haori. When Byakuya and Renji first appear, there's still no captain's haori, Renji implies he's some kind of retainer to the Kuchiki household, and he refers to Byakuya by a different term of respect than "captain"; additionally, Rukia seems to only recognize him as a powerful fighter among the Shinigami rather than a close childhood friend, and he in turn does not treat her even remotely in the same manner until several chapters after his introduction. When Soul Society is first shown in the manga, to follow Rukia's imprisonment, the military structure has been created. Also, Uryuu originally thought he was the Last Quincy and wearing an old-fashioned uniform until his father chastised him for misusing the "Last Quincy" title, but the final arc strongly implies that Uryuu has known about the Vandenreich from a young age because Souken told him about them, and makes it clear that the Vandenreich uniform is the original - not new - uniform. Kubo came up with the final arc in the latter half of the Soul Society arc.
</li><li> Kubo knew how the Soul Society and final arcs would go, but wasn't so sure about the middle, so some of the Arrancar development occurred as he was writing the Arrancar Arc. It also experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> to extend the storylines because the Arrancar were unexpectedly popular with the readers. As a result, Aizen's knowledge of his Arrancar subordinates seem unusually shaky; he initially describes Grimmjow's posse as "Gillians" when they're mostly Adjuchas, with only one Gillian in the group. Urahara also seems to be initially shaky on who the Visoreds are and where they come from, but it's later revealed his history is intimately connected to them as they were all exiled from Soul Society together.
</li><li> There are other plot elements that were introduced early in the series that ended up never being expanded on. A method of tracking people using things called Spirit Ribbons is also never seen again after the initial arc, with all of the characters tracking each other using only their spiritual power. In fact, the afterlife aspect of the series is often inconsequential, with various aspects of it (the reincarnation cycle, who hollows were before they changed into hollows, the possibility of Shinigami having once been humans themselves, and Hell) remaining unexplored in favor of battles between the various spiritual factions.
</li></ul></li><li> In the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>, it is implied that Kenshiro and Shin are the only successors of the <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> and <em>Nanto Seiken</em> martial art schools respectively. This is especially notable when Kenshiro reminds Shin that they must cooperate and help each other pass on their martial arts to future generations. After Shin's death, it is revealed that the <em>Nanto Seiken</em> style has exactly 108 schools as other practitioners of the style are gradually introduced and while <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> had a clearly-established one successor rule, there were other students of the art besides Ken himself who were not chosen for the succession.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The naming conventions and other things of stronger ninjutsu are a bit different in the beginning. In the Wave Country arc, stronger attacks took a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of hand seals, with the water dragon one (B-rank) taking <strong>42</strong>. After that, even the strongest techniques never used more than ten. Also, in the first arc most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">attack names</a> were proceeded with "Ninpou (ninja art/technique): (name of technique)", which was dropped later.
</li><li> When Sasuke is with Suigetsu on his way to recruit Karin into their group, he speaks of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForceIsStrongWithThisOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForceIsStrongWithThisOne">long-range chakra-sensing abilities</a> as if it's something completely unique to her. Later, Killer Bee sees her sensing his location he refers to her as a "sensor-<em>type</em>", implying long-distance chakra-sensing is an ability other ninja can have, although probably a rare one (which is later confirmed when no less than <em>three</em> more of them show up two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arcs</a> later, and an even later one has an entire division of an army made of them). In light of this, Sasuke's words come off as either uninformed or meaning her "unique power" was simply an individual and somewhat unusual version of it.
<ul><li> It was later retconned that her unique abilities are in reality a tremendous life force and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she is a member of the Uzumaki clan</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Naruto's own signature <em>Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</em> (Shadow Clone Technique) is an example—in the first story it gets treated as a dangerous technique and rare due to how much chakra it consumes. Later on, this is said to apply to only the <em>Mass</em> Shadow Clone Technique (i.e. creating lots of clones at once)—the smaller-scale version is fairly common among Leaf ninja, and its high chakra cost merely makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">inefficient in most situations,</a> rather than directly endangering the user.
</li><li> If you go back and reread the Chuunin Exam arc again, it's exceedingly obvious that Gaara was never meant to be a jinchuuriki — the concept of jinchuuriki didn't <em>exist</em> before the timeskip. He was simply an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Naruto, a boy with a monster inside him who succumbed to the darkness and became a killing machine. The most obvious evidence is the fact that Shukaku's powers and the form in which it manifests bear NO resemblance to any of the other jinchuuriki seen later in the series. Additionally, Shukaku was given its own backstory — far from being a "tailed beast", it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a>. (However, this has since been retconned as the citizens of Suna being unaware of Shukaku's true nature as a Tailed Beast and only assuming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">Was Once a Man</a> backstory to be the truth.)
</li><li> The Byakugan is introduced as if it would be much more powerful and important than it ends up being. During the Chunin exam 3rd stage preliminaries, Kakashi mentions a rumor stating that the Sharingan was originally a mutation of the Byakugan, and the latter's ability of insight surpasses the former's; he then adds that if Sasuke and Neji were to fight, Sasuke would have zero chance of winning. This status quo falls apart as the plot progresses. We are gradually introduced to the game-breaking Mangekyo Sharingan, an evolution of the sharingan with a wide range of abilities that <em>each</em> far surpass anything the Byakugan could possibly do. Later, we also find out about the Rinnegan, which has ominous ties to the origin of ninjutsu and has its own range of game-breaking abilities; we then come full circle as we find out that it was, all along, an evolution of the Sharingan. By the end, the Sharingan and its evolutions are a top tier force to be reckoned with, tied intricately into the series' convoluted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, while the Byakugan is the exact same kind-of-cool power with unrealized plot potential that it was during its introduction. To add insult to injury, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ultimate villain Kaguya apparently has the Byakugan, but she goes down in short order without showcasing a single Byakugan ability we haven't seen before, and due to the series being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> we will probably never learn why she even had it in the first place</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> an earlier chapter has Red capturing a Gyarados that already belonged to another trainer (Misty). However, at a later point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Blue</a>/Green says that, as is explicitly shown in most other parts of the franchise, catching a Pokémon some else has already caught is impossible. In another case, in the Red/Blue/Green arc, the Gym Badges had actual mystic powers and were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> the villains' plans centered around. In all later arcs, Gym Badges, including the original 8, are just ordinary badges.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime also seems inconsistent at how many Pokémon a trainer could carry. An early episode features a trainer who carries plenty of Poké Balls at the time; shortly afterwards we're told they're only allowed to carry six. What happens to the seventh' has also changed. Ash's Krabby simply disappears soon after he caught it and gets sent to Professor Oak. But when he catches Sewaddle in Unova the Poké Ball simply shrinks down and becomes unusable until Ash sends one of his other Pokémon away.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>
<ul><li> Hiei initially points out that he and Yukina are <strong>half</strong>-siblings with different mothers. In the Three Kings Saga, it's revealed that the two have the same mother, were born at the same time, and Hiei was conceived by a man, while Yukina was conceived asexually. Then again, it wouldn't have been out of character of Hiei to just lie.
</li><li> At one point, in his introduction, Kurama says he's 300 years old. Later he claims to be a thousand.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> A purely aesthetic one, but still noteworthy mistake. Robin, who is 28 at her introduction, got her first bounty when she was 8, and when some Marines recognize her, we see the bounty poster with a picture of her 8-year-old self in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>. On the picture, she has almost the exact same face as her adult self (though her nose is smaller and her hair shorter). The only thing that really gives her off as a kid is that she has the head-to-body-proportions of a young child. 200 chapters later, we get to see a long flashback with 8-year-old Robin. Now she is suddenly drawn with a more childlike and cuter face (bigger, rounder eyes and a different nose) which doesn't really look like her bounty poster picture. Later in the flashback, her bounty poster is issued and it does have her more mature-looking face on the photography, though outside of the poster she still has her cute child face. One would almost think the Marines traveled to the future, took a picture of her 28-year-old face and photoshopped it on her 8-year-old body...
</li><li> The Grand Line is first described as being hell-on-earth. While it is dangerous, it also seems to contain the majority of the world's population, and doesn't come off as the pirate's graveyard characters usually described it as. When the second half of the Grand Line, the New World, is introduced, it's described pretty similarly to how the whole Grand Line was portrayed before the characters actually got there.
</li><li> Several characters treat Devil Fruits as nothing more than myths, but the vast majority of the most famous people in the world have eaten a Devil Fruit, which makes it hard to believe that their existence would be in dispute.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> franchise, monsters were originally physical manifestations/mutations of human souls and emotions. These monsters could through magic be imprisoned in, and summoned from, magical stone slabs containing their images. The Duel Monsters cards were supposed to be the modern-day allegory of these Egyptian tablets, creating confusion when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> anime, in its fourth season, presented the monsters as being from another dimension as early as the times of Atlantis. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> also had the monsters as from another dimension and trapped in cards. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> went back to the idea of them being earthly spirits, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> went back to the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">parallel universe</a>" thing, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> makes the multiple dimensions thing a central plot point, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em> does away with both in favor of a VR dueling world.
<ul><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">original manga</a> was clearly not thought through all the way until later on, as earlier chapters have the implied backstory and nature of the Shadow Games as much different from what they would later be presented as, including later retcons on how Yugi's grandpa got the Puzzle.
</li><li> Similarly, the card game was originally supposed to be a one-off game like most other games in the manga, was titled "Magic &amp; Wizards" rather than "Duel Monsters", and was said to be an American game that only had a small following in Japan. A few arcs later, Duel Monsters is huge everywhere to the point that an entire Japanese city is used as the grounds for a tournament, and the anime spinoffs make it the center of the franchise.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">pre-Crisis</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> comics, it's explicitly stated that Superman is the last son of Krypton. This is fine for a while... until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAnother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAnother">Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, and more started showing up</a>. Someone once commented that Jor-El and Lara seem to have been the <em>only</em> people killed in the destruction of Krypton.
<ul><li> At least half of Superman's powers are the result of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a>. Originally he could lift a car over his head, outrun an express train, leap 1/8 of a mile, had telescopic vision and super-hearing, and "nothing but a bursting shell could pierce his skin". Later comics and cartoons gave him a long list of other/greater powers. The ones that stuck include the power to fly, the strength to lift ocean liners and move colossal space cruisers with his bare hands, enough speed to compete with the Flash in a foot race<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ds7v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ds7v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ds7v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was lampshaded in a more recent comic; when Superman says that he's raced Flash several times and even won a couple, Flash gives him a long-suffering look and says "Clark ... those races were for <em>charity</em>," implying that he was deliberately holding back to make it interesting for the viewers</span> and (sometimes) make inter-stellar flights, super-breath/freeze-breath, invulnerability to anything other than magic or kryptonite, and expanded his vision powers to include x-ray vision, heat vision, microscopic vision, and the ability to see across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
<ul><li> Even the <em>origin</em> of his superpowers changed within the years — as <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/27/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-how-does-superman-get-his-powers/">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> illustrates, Krypton was originally populated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> that are more athletically evolved than the Earth humans, but eventually "The Complete Story of Superman's Life" was published, establishing that a Kryptonian can only gain super abilities on Earth, due to being born on a planet with heavy gravity and a red sun.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> For his early appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em>, Nermal was owned by Jon's mother. Now he just wanders in whenever needed.
<ul><li> Similarly, Odie used to belong to Jon's friend Lyman. After Lyman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">vanished</a>, Odie became Jon's pet. Some fans believe digging up Jon's back yard could be... enlightening. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on the issue is "you don't want to look in Jon's basement".
<ul><li> One of the stories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GarfieldHis9Lives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GarfieldHis9Lives">Garfield: His 9 Lives</a></em> is an alternate history of Odie being bought by Jon as a companion for Garfield.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/StrontiumDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/StrontiumDog">Strontium Dog</a></em>, the term 'strontium dog' was originally an insult, and in an early strip, Johnny forced his client to pay him a higher fee after they refer to him as such. After a year or two, nobody seemed to care — Johnny referred to <em>himself</em> as a strontium dog, as well as his fellow bounty hunters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner">Namor</a> has the following as his current powers: Hulk-level super strength, flight, amphibious physiology, and a bad temper. When he was introduced, and well into the sixties, he could also talk to fish and mimic the abilities of any undersea creature, including <em>puffer fish.</em> No one really talks about these powers, but it's possible he only doesn't use them because it would make him look stupid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>:
<ul><li> Judges seem to have originally been portrayed as an elite unit within the regular police force, and some early strips feature non-Judge cops as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt">redshirts</a>. Nowadays, the entire police force is composed of Judges.
</li><li> The first published comic describes Dredd as operating in New York City and as having been <em>elected</em> to his post. Later, New York was revised to just part of Mega City One, and Judges were presented as having passed through an intense years-long training program before being graduated to duty with no election necessary.
</li></ul></li><li> If you're a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> fan you'll notice this happen often. Legends in Exile has a lot of differences to the later books. The community is suggested to be much larger, Beauty and Beast requiring a carriage to attend the annual Remembrance Day ball, yet by March of the Wooden Soldiers we can see that Fabletown is just a single, small street with a few hundred residents, most of whom live in the woodland building.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> ran into this with the comic's first issue, which depicted Hal Jordan's predecessor Abin Sur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">dying after crashing his spaceship on Earth</a>. It made perfect sense to readers at the time (everyone knows that aliens get around in spaceships, after all), but later issues would establish that Green Lantern rings give their bearers the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace">breathe in space</a> and fly at near-lightspeed, making spaceships unnecessary in the Green Lantern Corps. Various retcons and re-imaginings would later attempt to explain away the discrepancy by crafting reasons for Abin Sur to use a spaceship in his final mission, thus keeping the origin story intact.
<ul><li> In the pre-Crisis story "Earth's First Green Lantern," Abin Sur used a spaceship in a ploy to trap a parasitic alien by convincing it that his ring had run out of power (since, of course, a Green Lantern would only resort to using a spaceship if he couldn't use his ring).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s post-Crisis story "Tygers," he used a spaceship out of fear of a prophecy foretelling that his ring would fail him at a crucial moment, leading to his death. The prophecy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">ended up causing his death</a> because it led him to lose faith in his own power ring (which, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">requires willpower to work</a>).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>' post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em> retelling of his origin story, "Secret Origin," Abin Sur lost faith in his ring because of a prophecy foretelling that Parallax's influence on the Corps' central power battery would corrupt him, leading him to rely on a spaceship for his interplanetary voyages. He also needed the spaceship's holding cell to transport Atrocitus, an enemy of the Corps, back to his crucifix at the prison planet of Ysmault.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> film adaptation, the "spaceship" is changed to an escape pod, which a mortally wounded Abin Sur uses to escape Oa following a tumultuous battle that cripples his ability to use his ring.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em> was filled with this:
<ul><li> A few issues after the original clone story was published, there was a story that revealed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> clone (later named Ben Reily) was a partner of the Jackal (the initial villain mastermind behind the Clone Saga) who had been turned into an exact clone. This revelation was brought on by the High Evolutionary, a man who was on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Reed Richards</a> or Doctor Doom. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> brought the clone back, they had a quick throwaway line that the High Evolutionary was jealous and lied. This means that the Jackal, a B-list villain and lowly university professor, had somehow managed to one-up a man who had made himself as powerful as Galactus.
<ul><li> Miles Warren the Jackal was eventually revealed to have been the High Evolutionary's assistant at some point.
</li></ul></li><li> Many new clones were introduced as being made before Ben Reilly, making him much less special.
</li><li> Readers were subjected to this within the saga itself. The story also introduced a mysterious villain named Judas Traveler who was a mystic that had a wide variety of powers including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. The writers had no idea who this villain was, nor did they know what to do with him. It was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand-waved</a> that he was a mutant with the ability to cast illusions which set up many plot holes since the man was nearly omniscient.
</li><li> Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, the story was also responsible for bringing back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> from the dead. Not only did this slap a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> on a story that was written 20 years earlier but it negated the actions of the Jackal throughout the Saga. Just about all of the writers involved in the saga were notably against the retcon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Very</strong></em> early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Cassidy</a> survives being shot by the Saint of Killers. A vampire surviving being shot is no big deal, but we later learned that the Saint's guns were forged by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> himself from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Angel of Death's sword</a> and made so that they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">never miss</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">never run out of ammo</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">always kill whatever they hit</a>. The first thing the Saint does with them is shoot the Devil in the face, and at the very end of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he kills every Angel in Heaven and God himself with those guns</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis">Garth Ennis</a> later admitted that he didn't realize where he would eventually go with the Saint, and we should just try not to think too hard about that early encounter or why Cassidy survived.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics">Disney comics</a> arent heavy on continuity to begin with, so its no surprise that they sometimes fall prey to this trope. When Scrooge McDuck first appeared it was not explained where he got his money, but he was implied to have been born rich — e.g., in The Old Castles Secret, his second appearance, where he refers to his own wealth as the McDuck fortune (suggesting that it is in fact the <em>family</em> fortune), and owns a huge ancestral castle. A few years later, in The Magic Hourglass, its stated that he was <em>not</em> born wealthy, but became so through the power of the titular amulet. Finally, when Scrooge was given his own spinoff title (and was no longer just a supporting character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a></em> series) it became necessary to turn him into a more sympathetic, and even heroic, character; it was at this time that his current backstory was established: that he was born into poverty but rose to riches purely through his own grit and ingenuity (by being smarter than the smarties and tougher than the toughies) — the quintessential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>. This is the foundation on which all of his later characterization is built.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> was originally set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, much like various other licensed comics Marvel had at the time. Some Marvel characters cameoed in early issues and the Savage Land played a major role in the backstory. Soon, however, Marvel and Hasbro decided to split <em>Transformers</em> off into its own reality to prevent legal and continuity headaches. The setting shifted, semi-quietly, from established superhero universe to 'Earth never had contact with extranormal beings or objects until the Transformers showed up'. This led to an amusing situation where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> was <a class="urllink" href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Parker_(Earth-91274)">turned into a living paradox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. To elaborate; Spider-Man made a guest appearance in the third issue of <em>Transformers</em> and naturally makes references to other Marvel characters and events. Once the comic underwent Continuity Drift it caused Spidey to look utterly delusional, as he keeps referring to people that don't exist and events that never happened.
</li><li> The very first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> had the Four's base of operations located in a fictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">City of Adventure</a> called "Central City". It took a few issues before it became established that their adventures (as well as most of Marvel's other superhero comics) take place in New York City. Today, of course, stories set in New York are arguably Marvel's trademark, so it's hard to think of the series taking place anywhere else.
</li><li> In almost a sort of inverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift">Earth Drift</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> started out as merely a very dark, offbeat corner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, but - like its fellow proto-Vertigo books <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em> - eventually spun into its own, superhero-free reality. Contrast, for instance, <em>Preludes and Nocturnes</em> - featuring minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> rogue Doctor Destiny as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, and supporting roles from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan">Etrigan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Arkham Asylum</a> - with <em>A Game of You</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> (or, at least, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> named Hyperman) being a comic-book character was a key plot point.
<ul><li> <em>The Wake</em> somewhat reversed this, as a number of big-name superheroes (and even villains like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>) cameo at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dream's funeral</span>, but then again, it <em>is</em> the kind of reality-shattering event that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">you, the reader, got to attend</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to Superman, and possibly because she was specifically designed as a woman as good and powerful as him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s powers grew and got added to over the years often with little more than a handwave in the way of explanation, with her most notable and enduring new power being flight. As her powers grew the rest of the Amazons, who had initially played "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch">bullets and bracelets</a>'' casually were slowly depowered making Diana's achievement of defeating other Amazons in a competition of strength and martial arts far less impressive. The loose continuity in the Wonder Woman books has also contributed to the mess that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Donna Troy's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuitySnarl/DonnaTroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuitySnarl/DonnaTroy">backstory</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Film — Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Disney version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> doesn't always line up completely with its prequel film series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyFairies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyFairies">Disney Fairies</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the end of the first movie, a young Wendy can be glimpsed, in a scene taking place shortly after the birth of Tinker Bell herself. This makes little chronological sense, as everything about the way Peter Pan and Tinker Bell are treated in the first film implies they've long been outstanding inhabitants of Neverland, enough that they've both passed into Earth's folklore by the time Wendy is 12 years old. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> seems to have been declared on this particular scene, with later films apparently moving the timeline back to somewhere in the 19th century.)
</li><li> In <em>The Pirate Fairy</em>:
<ul><li> Captain Hook's arrival in Neverland as shown in that film does not really fit in with what is known of his background in the 1953 film: it is implied there that he was a pirate captain all along and came as one to Neverland, complete with crew and ship (hence why said crew is so anxious for their captain to give upon his grudge with Peter already and finally go <em>back</em> to his old ways), whereas <em>Pirate Fairy</em> shows him arriving as a young cabin boy in Neverland and finding the <em>Jolly Rogers</em> (with Smee as captain) already in Neverland, to somehow become its captain after the events of the movie.
</li><li> Hook's original sum-up of his crocodile problem in the 1953 movie made it clear that the Crocodile only started chasing him because he liked the taste of his hand when Peter fed it to the croc, and has been wanting more ever since. Even then, <em>Pirate Fairy</em> shows the Crocodile being first trained to hunt Hook by the fairies soon after it was born, and long before Hook's first confrontation with Peter Pan.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge">Ice Age</a></em> was set during a real ice age with humans. The sequels have more anthropomorphized animals, dinosaurs, pirate monkeys, Scrat causing continental drift twice — and no humans. However, as humans were <em>extremely</em> rare when <em>Ice Age</em> takes place it's possible they just never crossed paths.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: The prequel trilogy was written many years after the original trilogy. Some implications in the original trilogy don't seem to mesh very well with what the prequel trilogy reveals — to say nothing of continuity hiccups with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> (which was divided into a lower class of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a>). The possible explanations for these rifts vary in how far-fetched they are.
<ul><li> When watching the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, one gets the impression that the Empire has existed for a long time. The prequel trilogy, however, shows that it's only nineteen years old. For example:
<ul><li> Admiral Motti dismisses the Jedi Order as an "ancient religion" and Han Solo sees The Force as superstition, suggesting that they never even saw a Jedi firsthand in their lives. However, 19 years ago they were a major force in the center of the Republic. Of course, you have to remember that Han is from Corellia, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the EU expounds</a> as a world that tended to remain aloof from what was happening elsewhere in the galaxy; he spent practically all of his formative years on the fringes of galactic society (except in his late teens, when he briefly stayed on Coruscant with his live-in girlfriend); and while he was taught about the Force by the female Wookiee who raised him when he was a child, she only ever called it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">"the life power"</a> in the Wookiee language, and Han never seriously believed her.
</li><li> Tarkin announces the dissolution of the Senate as having swept away the "last remnants of the Old Republic", implying that the Senate had long been a powerless organ of a long-defunct government. Perhaps justified by the fact that the Empire had been declared nineteen years earlier, with the Senate remaining but all power really resting with Palpatine as the Emperor. Nearly twenty years is a fairly long period, after all, enough so that an entire generation of citizens could be born or grow up with it.
</li><li> Also related is Obi-Wan's line in the original movie about the Jedi serving the Republic for over a thousand generations before the dark times of the Empire. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>, it's stated that the Republic was formed a thousand <em>years</em> ago. The continuity wizards at Lucasfilm fixed this by stating that the Republic was <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ruusan_Reformation">merely restructured<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> around that time. It also coincided with the Republic returning to a position of true Galactic power after being reduced to a rump state by a long series of wars with a Sith empire. The new EU has changed this slightly, claiming the Old Republic <em>preceded</em> the Galactic Republic, with the latter being formed after the fall of the latter. Yet this contradicts references in the films where the late government is clearly called "the Old Republic". However, that could be generic "old" or just lumping them together, since for instance the French Fifth Republic followed the Fourth Republic, though both are called "the French Republic" as well (being two succeeding versions of the same thing).
</li></ul></li><li> When Vader tells Tarkin that Obi-Wan is aboard the Death Star, Tarkin says "Obi-Wan Kenobi? Surely he must be dead by now." Vader replies "Don't underestimate The Force." This implies that if Kenobi weren't a Jedi, he likely would have died of old age by then. The prequels set Kenobi as no older than his 60s during <em>A New Hope</em>, hardly an improbable age — although Tarkin could be interpreted as referring to Empire's purge of the Jedi.
</li><li> Obi-Wan says, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, "When I first met him, your father was already a great pilot, but I was amazed at how strongly the Force was with him." It's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">technically</a></em> accurate, but surely he would mention Anakin was already a great pilot <em>at the age of nine?</em> But that detail didn't exist at the time. Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, Anakin had more interaction between Obi-Wan's master Qui-Gon, who became almost a father figure and was the true impetus behind Anakin learning about the Force. Lucas originally had Obi-Wan take Qui-Gon's role in the final film but decided to age him down and introduce Qui-Gon to show a proper Master-Padawan duo.
</li><li> Obi-Wan says in the same instance in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> that his chief failing was thinking he could train Anakin as well as Yoda. This is nowhere apparent in the prequels and the one pushing for Anakin being trained is Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan merely trains Anakin as a final favor to him, and Yoda seems to focus entirely on foundational training for the youngest students. More significantly, Obi-Wan seems to be implying in <em>Jedi</em> that it was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">hubris</a> in believing that he could train Anakin as a Jedi despite lacking Yoda's greater experience and wisdom that caused Anakin to fall to the Dark Side; the prequel trilogy established the idea of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a> where a Jedi Knight adopts and trains a Padawan as the normal way of things (and Obi-Wan isn't portrayed as a particularly bad teacher in any meaningful way), making Obi-Wan not really responsible for Anakin's fall at all.
</li><li> Obi-Wan addresses Vader as "Darth", having earlier referred to him as "A young Jedi named Darth Vader", implying that "Darth" is his first name. The prequels and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> show that it's actually a title, akin to Vader calling Obi-Wan "General" or "Master". In retrospect, the scene works very well if we declare that Obi-Wan is making a point out of <em>refusing</em> to call Vader by his name. But when the first movie was written, "Darth" was really just Vader's first name (and he really <em>did</em> murder Luke's father, who only became Vader himself for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>).
</li><li> Ben also says in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> that Yoda was the Jedi Master who instructed him. Yet in Episode I, he's the Padawan of Qui-Gon, not Yoda. In Episode II, Yoda is shown teaching a large class of younglings, implying that Yoda gives some training to many or all Jedi, but it's still not appropriate to say that Yoda was <em>the</em> Jedi Master who trained Kenobi. In episode two Douku reveals that he was Yoda's Padawan, and that Qui-Gon was his Padawan, who then trained Obi-Wan, meaning that Obi-Wan was trained by Yoda in a very roundabout way, though it would still be silly to say that Yoda was his instructor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, Obi-Wan makes it sound like Anakin Skywalker and Owen Lars had a long history together, saying things like "[Owen] didn't hold with your father's ideals" and "He thought [Anakin] should have stayed here and not gotten involved." Then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>, we learn that the two aren't even blood relatives, and they only met each other once. Briefly, at that. They were originally intended to have been brothers, but this was changed (obviously).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> Obi-Wan's ghost thinks Luke is the Jedi's last hope, but Yoda notes "there is another"... who was of course revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> to be Leia who was Luke's sister all along. But Obi-Wan does not seem to be aware that Luke even has a sister in <em>Empire</em>. This is because Leia was <em>not</em> Luke's sister when <em>Empire</em> was filmed, and only became so when <em>Return</em> was being written. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> complicates things further by having Obi-Wan being present at Luke and Leia's births, even delivering them himself to their respective foster families.
</li><li> There's also the fact that Leia explicitly says she remembers what her biological mother was like in <em>Return</em>, only for it to be revealed in <em>Revenge</em> that Padme died giving birth to the twins. Of course as a Force sensitive it's entirely possible that Force children have a much greater connection, and even memory, of their mother from within the room. Though that doesn't explain the disparity of Leia remembering her and Luke not. Another possibility is that Leia was talking about Breha Organa, her adopted mother. Another possibility is that Leia was lying: she is a princess and a diplomat, she simply said "She was beautiful" which was all Luke wanted to hear and which is not a very specific fact that only someone who actually knew the person would know about.
</li><li> In <em>A New Hope</em>, "Ben Kenobi" wears brown robes and a white tunic, which seem like pretty fitting garb for a mysterious old hermit living in the middle of nowhere. But in the prequels, the brown robes and white tunic were made into the official uniform of the Jedi Order. If Obi-Wan was really trying to pass himself off as an unassuming old hermit while hiding from the Empire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">he apparently wasn't trying very hard</a>.
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: when C-3PO first meets Luke's family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, Uncle Owen (who's looking for an interpreter) asks him if he can speak Bocce, and Threepio replies "Of course I can, sir! It's like a second language to me!" His word choice can seem a bit odd after you've seen the later movies, which clearly establish that Threepio is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot">omniglot</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">fluent in over six million forms of communication</a>", and that he speaks far more than just <em>two</em> languages.
</li><li> <em>A New Hope</em> establishes that the Jedi were hunted to near-extinction by Darth Vader and the Empire, but it never says anything about a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">purge</a> from within the ranks of the Old Republic's military, and it never makes it clear that Imperial Stormtroopers are all under standing orders to kill Jedi on sight. As Michael from Belated Media points out, this can make it seem odd that Obi-Wan has seemingly no problem with igniting his lightsaber in the middle of a crowded bar in Mos Eisley, knowing full well that there's a squad of Stormtroopers right outside the bar looking for a pair of wanted fugitives.
</li><li> It is stated by many background materials that Artoo has never had his memory erased, unlike Threepio. George Lucas has gone so far as to claim that the entire film saga has an unseen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> wherein Artoo is recounting the events to an alien race after the fact. However, especially given Artoo's extensive involvement in the prequels, this creates the problem of him never demonstrating any knowledge of important background that he <em>really</em> ought to be telling Luke about. Like the fact that he knew Anakin, Padme and Obi-Wan for <em>years</em> and could have given a detailed account of everything that led to Luke's life working out the way that it had!
</li><li> <em>A New Hope's</em> opening crawl declares that the Rebel fleet had recently won a major victory which had spurred others to join them, and presented Leia's ship carrying the plans being intercepted as a separate thing. <em>Rogue One</em> later established that other than securing the plans the battle was a <em>disaster</em> for the Rebel fleet, and moreover Vader had pursued Leia's ship directly from there (making her claims that they were on an unrelated diplomatic mission a hilariously blatant lie). The claim that it was the first major Rebel victory is also contradicted by... basically the entire prequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, which featured numerous naval victories and culminated in a successful planetary rebellion.

<ul><li> Dr. Hank McCoy makes his first appearance in a background cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, where he's a human-looking scientist being interviewed on a news program. When he appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em>, though, he's a politician with a spot in the United States Presidential Cabinet, and he appears in his classic blue-furred simian mutant form. But then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em>, which reveals that he was one of Professor Xavier's original X-Men, shows that he's had blue fur since his early 20's, when one of his experiments went awry and accelerated his mutation.
<ul><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em> reveals that Hank developed a serum that let him pass for human for short periods. It also clarifies the true nature of his close relationship with Charles Xavier, establishing that he was the only one of Xavier's original students that stayed behind when Xavier shut the school down during the Vietnam War.

</li><li> Dr. Moira MacTaggert is first introduced in a brief cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em>, where she's a British scientist who has apparently been friendly with Charles Xavier for years. But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em>, which takes place about 40 years before the rest of the series, she's an American CIA agent who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has her memories of Xavier erased at the end of the movie</span>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a> first meets Wolverine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">X-Men</a></em>, he never gives any indication that he knows who Wolverine is, even though he spends more time with him than with any of the X-Men. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> later reveals that, not only do the two have an extensive history together (going back to the mid-1800's), they're actually <em>half-brothers</em>. The first film also depicts Sabretooth as a barely-intelligible, beast-like creature who rarely speaks, while the prequel has him as a much more intelligent and articulate villain.
</li><li> The first movie also subtly implies that Wolverine's claws are mechanical in nature, and screws can even clearly be seen in them during the scene where Magneto attacks him in the train. This is further enforced in <em>X2</em>, where Stryker tells Logan "You were an animal <em>then</em>, you're an animal <em>now</em>. I just gave you claws." <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> would later incorporate the comics' retcon that Logan possessed natural bone claws that were later coated in adamantium.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">X-Men</a></em> states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> built his psychic-proof helmet around the time that Senator Kelly's Mutant Registration Act led him to ramp up the Brotherhood's terrorist campaign, since he knew that Xavier was tracking him. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em> establishes that he's had his helmet since the 1960's, and that he originally stole it from Sebastian Shaw.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> features a brief appearance by Kayla Silver Fox's sister: a blonde-haired woman who's clearly intended to be Emma Frost (she has Emma's ability to turn her body into organic diamond, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript">is listed as "Emma" in the final credits</a>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em> later explicitly introduces Emma Frost as a major character—who's around the same age as the character in <em>Origins</em> (even though the two films take place 15 years apart), has psychic powers that were never mentioned in <em>Origins</em>, and never gives any indication that she's related to Kayla Silver Fox.
</li><li> In a possible case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em> introduces Bolivar Trask in a small supporting role as the United States Secretary of Defense, but never gives him a major role in the story. He later reappears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em> as a major antagonist... where he's gone from a tall, middle-aged African-American military officer to a Caucasian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage">dwarf</a> scientist who was assassinated by Mystique in the 1970's.
</li><li> Despite both being major characters with top billing, Professor Xavier and Mystique never seem to directly interact with each other in the original trilogy, and they never give any indication that they have a history... which is odd, since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em> reveals that Mystique is Xavier's adopted sister, and that Xavier has known her even longer than he's known Erik Lehnsherr.

The later movie <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> shows that it was actually created by Abraham Erskine.

<ul><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> book kind of implies that there are humans around somewhere. It suggests the standard rules for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">talking animals</a> (they just don't do it in front of people except for maybe one kid who has magical adventures with them, and let's ignore the implications as far as livestock are concerned), but this all goes away from the second book on. It is also implied that the humans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouseWorld">much larger</a> and may not understand them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The kitchens moved. Rowling intentionally wrote a bit in the first book saying how the layout of Hogwarts is constantly changing <em>specifically</em> to cover for this sort of thing.
</li><li> The points are worth a lot more in the first Harry Potter book — Harry and company are mortified at the prospect of losing 50, let alone 150 points, but in a later book, Snape docks 50 points with only a passing mention. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves">Steve Kloves</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus">Chris Columbus</a>) tried to mitigate the point thing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">the first movie</a>. At the end of the first Potions lesson (the part left on the cutting room floor), Snape takes five points from Gryffindor whereas he only took one point in the corresponding scene from the book. (By the later books, taking five points had become the standard response to a minor infraction.)
</li><li> In the first book, Hagrid describes the deaths of Lily and James as if they hadn't been actively against Voldemort already, and it was a mystery why he would even be bothered to kill them if the opportunity came up. In the third book, Fudge, telling the story of how Voldemort found them, mentions that it was "well-known" Voldemort had been seeking the Potters at the time, with Hagrid right there, and by the fifth, we learn that they served alongside Hagrid in the eponymous Order of the Phoenix the first time around. The effect is that in that first scene with Harry, Hagrid lied... a lot. The movie corrected this also, taking out the questioning of why Voldemort went after Harry's parents and having Hagrid simply say "your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, the Death Eaters who tortured Neville Longbottom's parents into insanity are charged with having assaulted "an auror and his wife," which certainly implies that Neville's mother was not herself an auror. By the next book, however, Rowling had apparently decided that both of Neville's parents should have been aurors, making the phrasing of the charges in the previous volume extremely difficult to justify without positing a degree of sexism not otherwise evidenced in Rowling's wizarding world. (The most common explanation is that Alice was either still on maternity leave, or had quit to raise Neville, but still.)
</li><li> In later books, you need only to say "Riddikulus" to beat a boggart. The whole "make it funny" part is abandoned after the third book.
</li><li> Characters in the books have a tendency to refer to things in vague terms early in the series, after which they are only ever referred to by name. For instance, "the Azkaban guards" are mentioned several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber of Secrets</a></em>, but never actually called "Dementors" until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>. Similarly, the Wizard police are briefly called "hit-Wizards" in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> before the term "Auror" is introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, and Voldemort's followers are never referred to as "Death Eaters" until <em>Goblet of Fire</em> introduces the term.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>: In the words of Pratchett, there is no Continuity Drift. There may, however, be "alternate pasts". In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>, probably by accident while trying to do something else.
<ul><li> And then the history monks, also known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MenInBlack">Men in Saffron</a>, had to come by and try to sort it out as best they could. The classic "bug" is that the two major playhouses in Ankh-Morpork are the grand Victorian-era Ankh-Morpork Opera House from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em> and the shabby Elizabethan-era theater The Dysk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em>, an obvious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>, especially since the Dysk was built in WS to be "a new <em>type</em> of building", and the Opera House has a history stretching back decades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic">The Colour of Magic</a></em> has references to the "other lords of the Circle Sea", and implies that Ankh-Morpork is simply the biggest and most crime ridden of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">dangerous city states</a> in the region. Later books show that the other 'cities' are peaceful, rural backwaters. The same book implies Ankh and Morpork were separate cities, a point that is never restated. (Though when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vimes</span> is created a Lord, he is made the Duke of <em>Ankh</em> specifically, not the Duke of Ankh-Morpork, which implies that either the Duke of Ankh title is an old one that has been reinvigorated for him, or that there is a separate Duke/Baron/Count/Whatever of Morpork, or both.)
</li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books, Lord Vetinari comes off as an overweight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>, but in later books, he morphs into the thin, perpetually-gaunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">master-manipulator</a> we know and love. Fans have attempted to explain this away by stating that it was a different Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has stated that this is not the case. (Specifically, Pterry has said that they were both intended to be the same man, but one of them was written by a younger and less experienced author.)
<ul><li> Same goes for Granny Weatherwax. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites">Equal Rites</a>,</em> her constant accomplice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Nanny</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldWoman">Ogg</a> is nowhere to be found, she only wears her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">pointy hat</a> when necessary, and she <em>actually lets someone interrupt her without reprisal.</em> It took a couple of books before she metamorphosed into the walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> she's known to be.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites">Equal Rites</a></em> mentions the existence of Magicians (essentially failed students who are reduced to being lab assistants to proper Wizards) and Thaumaturgists (untrained dogs bodies who go and fetch dangerous spell components such as "the semen of a live tiger"). Neither are ever heard of again despite several books focusing pretty heavily on the Wizards.
<ul><li> The title magician is amusingly enough brought up one more time after its introduction, a character that doesn't know any better refers to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully as one. For his part Ridcully can barely contain his disgust at being referred to as such.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor example: <em>Nanny Ogg's Cookbook</em> (1999) has a bit in the courtship section about sending coded messages by the positioning of stamps on a love letter. Nanny views this as a bit old-fashioned, from the days when "a girl wasn't expected to have any private correspondence until she was thirty-five." In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em> (2004), Moist von Lipwig invents the postage stamp....<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1oke4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1oke4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1oke4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This could be handwaved <em>if</em> you subscribe to the idea that the 'Nanny Ogg'-era stamps are the ink-pad type mentioned early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>, and the sender somehow convinces the local postal worker to place the ink a certain way.</span>
</li><li> A lot of the Ankh-Morpork related inconsistencies are because the city was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FafhrdAndTheGrayMouser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FafhrdAndTheGrayMouser">Lankhmaresque</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndSorcery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndSorcery">generic fantasy</a> pastiche. As it became more unique, a lot of the original characterization was dropped. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic">The Colour of Magic</a></em>, it's much more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> than the borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">City of Adventure</a> in the later books.
</li><li> In a few early books it was a plot point that dwarfs age much slower than humans, to the point that by dwarf standards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldWoman">Nanny Ogg</a> was barely the equivalent to a teenager and they don't even hit puberty until 50. In recent books they age at the same rate as humans and interspecies couples are said to have grown up together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger">the first book</a>, Roland discovers that the Man in Black he's been chasing isn't Marten Broadcloak but Walter O'Dim. Later books in the series indicate that Marten and Walter are the same adversary Roland's been chasing all this time, not just symbolically as "the Man in Black" but <em>literally the same person</em>. This is made explicit in the revised version.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree">the second book</a>, Eddie Dean is from Co-Op City, the Bronx, in 1983. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWastelands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWastelands">book III</a> onward, he's from Co-Op City, Brooklyn, in 1987. This would be a simple gaffe, if not for the fact that it becomes a plot point that Co-Op City really <em>is</em> in the Bronx, and Eddie's Co-Op City in Brooklyn is a sign that his world isn't the "real world".
</li><li> There are tons of minor changes as well. For example, it seems like Roland's motivation for going to the Dark Tower changes every book as does the function of the Tower itself. Hell, Roland attributes the multiverse's imminent collapse on the Tower itself at the end of the fourth book. It's not until the last three that everything finally solidifies, probably due to King finally deciding what the Tower is and does.
</li><li> King can't seem to make up his mind exactly how old Eddie and Susannah are. In one book, Eddie is twenty-three; in the next, he's "nearly ten years older" than Jake, who is consistently said to be eleven. This might be related to the aforementioned confusion over what year Eddie left his world. And in the third book, it's mentioned that Susannah is three years older than Eddie, while the second book implies that the age gap is much greater.
</li><li> In the original version of the first book, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is referred to (in a very sinister manner) as <em>The Beast</em>. Turns out they meant the Crimson King all along, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and he's not very tough</span>.
</li><li> In general, the books tend to vacillate on whether Roland's companions <em>actually</em> hail from the real world, or just from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">the same fictional universe</a> where most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s other books take place. Case in point: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree">The Drawing of the Three</a></em> has a scene where Eddie Dean remembers seeing the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> (which was originally a Stephen King novel), while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardAndGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardAndGlass">Wizard and Glass</a></em> claims that his brother Henry was friends with Skipper Brannigan (the bully who torments Dinky Earnshaw in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EverythingsEventual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EverythingsEventual">Everything's Eventual</a>"), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolvesOfTheCalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolvesOfTheCalla">Wolves of the Calla</a></em> has Father Callahan (first introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot">'Salem's Lot</a></em>) saved from Neo-Nazis by the same kindly booksellers whom Jake Chambers meets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands">The Waste Lands</a></em>. This becomes particularly glaring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfSusannah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfSusannah">Song of Susannah</a></em>, where Roland and Eddie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">outright meet Stephen King and discover that they're both characters from his novels</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2pabc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2pabc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2pabc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Among other things, Eddie discovers that he was born in Co-Op City in Brooklyn because King forgot that Co-Op City is actually in the Bronx.</span> But then the last book in the series features Roland traveling to New York to meet Susannah's godfather Moses Carver immediately after encountering Stephen King in Maine, with Carver even giving him a copy of King's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Insomnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Insomnia">Insomnia</a></em>. It's...a little inconsistent, to say the least.
</li></ul></li><li> The most obvious bit of Continuity Drift in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneralSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneralSeries">The General Series</a></em> is the way Lady Suzette's eye color and the number of generations her family have been patricians vary from book to book.
</li><li> Pick any two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Oz</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a> and then work out a coherent history of that country and its populace.
<ul><li> This is lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>, where Elphaba and Boq are searching through documents in their school's library trying to piece together the origins of Oz, and everything they find is confusing and contradicting.
</li><li> It's not even just the history, it happens within the books. The Shaggy Man meets Polychrome for the first time twice, merely because Baum forgot he had introduced them in the same book.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> Quite an infamous one among fans is that one of its shape-shifting heroes uses the telepathic communication they speak with while in animal form when he's in his normal human form. Every book afterwards features "thought speak" as only being functional when they're in bodies other than their own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KAApplegate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KAApplegate">K. A. Applegate</a> (the author) herself has flat-out admitted that it was a mistake. The fan nickname for the incident and others is KASU, an acronym for "Katherine Applegate Screws Up/Screw-Ups". An extensive list can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091027005821/http://geocities.com/sbsa01/kasu.htm">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> There are also minor ones, such as the Yeerk naming system. At first, not just Visser but <em>all</em> names are treated as ranks, with at least three "Iniss [some number here]" people, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a> victim among them serving as a reminder to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Iniss 226/Chapman that even "an Iniss of the third century" is expendable. A later Yeerk had had his number lowered as part of an advance in rank. After these early examples, no two non-Visser/Sub-Visser Yeerks will ever have the same name, or have attention called to their designation. Vissers' names before they were Vissers are considered their "real names" and are never "[Word here] 1."
</li><li> We get bits and pieces of the Ellimist's backstory throughout the series... then the Ellimist Chronicles comes along, <em>ignoring all of those bits</em>. However, Marco mentions more and more leading up to it that "we don't know if he's one guy or part of a group." (When we first met him, he <em>explicitly</em> calls the Ellimists a group more than once. Some time after the last time, Marco decides it's a question for some reason. Then it turns out he's one guy — whose story has little in common with the hints given in the series proper.)
</li><li> Related to the first KASU (a term KA actually uses sometimes!) is Ax's use of thoughtspeak in human form. At first, he mentions that as a human he must now use human speech. Eventually, though, he begins using thought speak in human form to talk privately with the other Animorphs. As human form is a morph for him, he still has it there. Apparently, he just... never thought to try it for over 30 books? Ax does obsess annoyingly over making mouth-sounds for fun, but telepathy would still have been useful in many situations.
</li><li> Also, early on, thought-speak could send imagery and feelings as well as just words. This goes away fairly soon, though, and another alien race with its own version of thoughtspeak that worked <em>exclusively</em> on images and feelings eventually cropped up.
</li><li> Whether "War Prince" is the rank after "Prince" or simply the full title and used with it interchangeably changes back and forth.
</li><li> Crayak is a "he" until his very last appearance, then becoming an "it."
</li><li> If you want to get <em>really</em> picky, when Visser isn't used as part of someone's name, is it capitalized or not? Visser Three is "the Visser" for a very long time, then becomes "the visser."
</li><li> Early books seem to imply that the Yeerk homeworld is part of the Yeerk Empire—Visser One was apparently stationed there before visiting Earth in book 5, and the future Visser Three tries to use the Time Matrix to escape there in <em>The Andalite Chronicles.</em> However, <em>The Hork-Bajir Chronicles</em> states that the Andalites blockaded the planet soon after the war started, and the Yeerks still on that planet have no contact with the Empire; neither visser would even be old enough to have been born there. But why would Visser Three try to flee to a planet where his enemies are in control? Even with an Andalite body that seems like a pretty big risk to yourself and your new, incredibly-valuable super-weapon.
</li><li> Early books seem to imply that the Yeerks had conquered numerous species; the Yeerk controlling Jake, for example, lists a couple random ones to imply how mighty the Empire is. Later books, however, never bring up any (totally) conquered species other than the Hork-Bajir, Taxxons and Gedds.
</li><li> The Earlier books give the impression the Andalite-Yeerk war has gone on for a very long time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">likely centuries or more</a>. Then the Hork-Bajir Chronicles would reveal that the Andalites didn't even meet the Yeerks until 1966 Earth time, and the Visser book reveals the Yeerk infiltration of Earth didn't start until the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">90s</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirBulychev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirBulychev">Kir Bulychev</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture">Alice, Girl from the Future</a></em> series is notorious for this. Most notably, Krys (Rat), a recurring villain, goes from being a spider-like alien who uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a> to a humanoid alien who changes shapes without explanation to a rat-like alien who changes shapes thanks to special pills. As Bulychev himself admitted in an interview late in life, this was due to the fact that he didn't like to re-read his books.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> is a prime example — it was rewritten at least three times to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding">fit in</a> with the wider Middle-earth mythology (e.g., in the first draft, Bilbo mentions the possibility of going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift">China</a>). Even then, some incongruous details remain, like a talking purse, mountain giants playing catch with boulders, and magical boots that fasten themselves (invented by Gandalf). Tolkien said the earlier account of Bilbo getting the One Ring was a lie. The later and truer account was later written down after Gandalf questioned Bilbo about the ring.
<ul><li> His son, Christopher Tolkien, wrote in the preface to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> that he had a devil of a time editing his father's as-yet unfinished material into something internally consistent, because this was so bad. But then again, it was unfinished, largely because J.R.R. kept going going back to the beginning to revise it. (And considering that at least one version had a framing-device of a sailor writing down previously oral-only tales at the equivalent of a wayside inn, some internal inconsistency would be expected.)
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> novels suffered from this. It's pretty much impossible to reconcile Bond's history as given in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale">Casino Royale</a></em> with his obituary in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouOnlyLiveTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouOnlyLiveTwice">You Only Live Twice</a></em>, unless the British secret service was in the habit of sending teenaged schoolboys out to conduct elaborate coups against the Bulgarians at the gaming tables of Europe. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungBond">Young Bond</a></em> series of juvenile novels have done an excellent job at explaining away some of the inconsistencies (such as making his first car a gift from a dying uncle he received while still a teenager).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a>, in <em>Warrior's Apprentice</em>, it says that Vorhalas' sons were on the wrong side of Vordarian's Pretendership, whereas in <em>Barrayar</em> one is angry because the other was executed for dueling.
<ul><li> The angry surviving brother <em>is</em> strongly implied (maybe outright stated?) to have had Vordarian's backing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in his assassination attempts, which Miles elsewhere refers to as part of the war</span>. The duellist's fate might be pure drift, or might not: a lot of <em>Apprentice</em> is driven by Miles' parents' generation obfuscating some of the ugly details of that time period. It's quite possible Aral told Miles "he was killed in the civil war" in lieu of "he was executed for getting drunk and murdering his friend". (And also, much of the first part of <em>Barrayar</em> was apparently written before <em>Apprentice</em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> series started off the character of Flinx as a partially telepathic young thief, with the implication that his powers, though unusual, are not particularly terrifying and bizarre. The two mentor figures, Bran Tse-Mallory and Truzenzuzex, even comment among themselves that the boy is "a partial telepath", but apparently don't care enough to research the matter further. In later novels that expand Flinx's origin story, it's revealed that he's an empath, not a telepath, and was created as such by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">universally reviled</a> group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologists</a>, so they <em>really</em> ought to have been more curious. Also, Flinx's age given in <em>Bloodhype</em> conflicts with the universal timeline Foster later established, the description of his ship is vastly different (to the point where Foster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> it to be able to camouflage and reconfigure itself at will), and his pet minidrag is male, rather than the female it was established canonically to be in the chronologically earlier <em>The End of the Matter</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a>: For continuity drift within a single book try Kenneth Grahame's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWindInTheWillows">The Wind in the Willows</a></em>. The relation between the anthropomorphic animals and humans changes between chapters. Initially the two groups are entirely separate, with the animals mostly ignorant of humans and their culture. Then Toad turns up, with his house, his ability to buy and drive cars, and his subjection to the criminal justice system — nobody notes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">amphibian nature</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> has this as well.
<ul><li> At first, battles were a lot more common and weren't treated nearly as seriously as they are in later books. In later stories, an border skirmish is a big deal and cause for concern about Clan wars, where in the early books it was the standard response to finding a trespasser: fight first, ask questions later. ShadowClan driving WindClan out in the first book <em>was</em> taken seriously, but if that happened in later books it would have been an instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> rather than the other Clans just raising a slight protest over the aggressiveness of the action.
</li><li> A more minor example: The first book states that each apprentice must visit the Moonstone before becoming a warrior: they travel there with the leader when he or she decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation">speak with StarClan</a>. While we don't actually see it happen for the rest of the first series, it still gets mentioned occasionally. It's totally forgotten in the second series, and after it was pointed out by fans, the authors later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> it by having Leafpool say "We seem to have left that tradition behind in our old home." In the prequel Super Editions that take place before the first series, they do have the "each apprentice must visit the Moonstone" requirement again, but oddly enough it's the apprentices themselves, rather than the leader, that receives the visions from their ancestors at the Moonstone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireOfTheAnts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireOfTheAnts">Empire of the Ants</a></em> by Bernard Werber started out as a story among ants communicating with each other, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu">Humans Are Cthulhu</a>. 327, a male ant, witnesses dozens of ants being killed at the same time by an unknown enemy, and asks other ants about it. A yellow ant tells him that he once saw several ants being killed like this, while crashed by a pinecone, and is described as "laughing" as this is "yellow ant humor". In the sequel books (<em>Day of the Ants</em> and <em>Revolution of the Ants</em>), though, the ants are described as not knowing what humor is and the humans have to describe it and teach them.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt">Tom Holt</a>'s first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JWWellsAndCo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JWWellsAndCo">J.W. Wells &amp; Co.</a></em> novel, using the eponymous Portable Door for more than an hour is incredibly draining, with potential risk to the user's life. By <em>May Contain Traces of Magic</em>, a character has pretty much relocated to his past (our present) using said Door, and isn't even remotely drained.
</li><li> Constance's eye color in <em>The Book of the Dead</em> changes from violet to blue to "dark" over the course of the novel.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a> by Tamora Pierce, the rules of magic change over time.
<ul><li> In the first quartet of books in the setting, <em>The Song of the Lioness</em>, there are two kinds of magic. The Gift allows for things like starting fires, healing, and all the other active spells you can think of. The Sight is a passive magic ability allowing the practitioner magical insight into things they see. One character says that the Gift acts as a shield against those with the Sight. Three miniseries later, another character has the Sight so strongly she can see a great many things about people with the Gift.
</li><li> Wild magic, introduced in the second quartet, allows for a different kind of magic than the normal Gift — the ability to talk to animals and eventually shapeshift. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand waved</a> by being subtle enough in most practitioners to be commonly disregarded as folk tale fodder.
</li><li> Specific to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper">Beka Cooper</a></em> trilogy, Beka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">Psychopomp</a> Gift. In <em>Terrier</em>, it's something extraordinary when she communicates directly with a pigeon-riding ghost; most other times all she can do is listen to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a>. In <em>Bloodhound</em>, she speaks to the pigeon ghosts as a matter of course. The reason for this change is never directly stated; most fans decide that she developed her ability between books to explain it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse">Circleverse</a></em> series, the sources of ambient magic have become more anthropomorphized as the books go on. They always have been, to some degree (Sandry "frightens" some wool during the first book), but it's usually been a case of mages being able to relate to their own source of magic. By <em>Melting Stones</em>, the ocean speaks directly to Evvy the stone mage and is openly malevolent towards her. Natural events are also more tractable. In the first book, Tris nearly kills herself by trying to stop the tides along a short stretch of beach; in <em>Melting Stones</em> (again), Evvy is able to speak and reason with a Vesuvius-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> volcano.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> seems to contradict the films occasionally.
<ul><li> In the introduction to the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> (whose title is just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, of course), it is explicitly stated that the Emperor is a powerless weakling who is controlled by his Evil Advisors. According to Wookieepedia, the Whills got the whole story from R2-D2 about 100 years later, so that means every one of the main characters is now an established liar. The novelization, published under Lucas's name but ghostwritten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a>, actually came out months before the movie.
</li><li> The opening crawl of <em>A New Hope</em> states that "Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire." Take a wild guess if the Expanded Universe portrays more than zero Rebel victories taking place before this. So it all starts with the <em>second line</em> of the first-released film. And that's probably only because "It is a period of civil war." is pretty hard to screw up.
</li><li> The lightsaber itself started as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantWeaponForAMoreCivilizedAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantWeaponForAMoreCivilizedAge">ceremonial weapon</a>, mostly used for battles between Jedis and a last resort weapon when diplomacy failed. Twenty years of expanded universe, parodies and video games later, Jedis are facing off entire armies with nothing but a lightsaber.
</li><li> In the novelization to <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, it was stated that Darth Vader got his injuries from falling into a lava pit after a duel with Obi-Wan. This was taken for granted for decades until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> revealed that Obi-Wan cut off his limbs (the remaining ones, anyway) and Vader was burned by his close proximity to the lava, but not actually falling into it Terminator-style. Lucas himself mentioned Vader's fall into a volcanic pit to <em>Rolling Stone</em> as early as 1977 but in the same interview Vader and Luke's dad are separate characters.
</li><li> The <em>Return of the Jedi</em> novelization follows a draft of the movie in stating Obi-Wan and Uncle Owen were actually brothers. Nothing really contradicted it until <em>Attack of the Clones</em> where Owen is Anakin's stepbrother. Thus, after <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Jedi Academy Trilogy</a></em> novel with young Obi-Wan came out which mentioned his brother Owen.
</li><li> The Force Ghost technique was implied in the original trilogy to be the standard Jedi afterlife. Even Anakin achieves it when he dies after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. By the time new Expanded Universe material and the prequels came out, it was established that this technique was extremely difficult to perform and that Qui-Gon Jinn was the first to use it, and that Yoda and Obi-Wan learned it from him.
</li><li> Taking down an AT-AT walker with the tow cable in <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> comes across as a crazy last-ditch gamble. In Expanded Universe, especially video games, this is used as a common tactic (probably because players would feel ripped off if they didn't get a chance to duplicate the famous maneuver). This was justified at least once by saying that as much of a crazy gamble as <em>trying</em> it the first time was, it worked so unexpectedly well as to become standard thereafter.
</li><li> The original EU heavily implied that the Clone Wars were fought by the Republic and the Jedi <em>against</em> clones. Which is arguably true, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">from a certain point of view</a>, but clearly not one shared with Timothy Zahn, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkForceRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkForceRising">wrote of the cloning cylinders of the Spaarti clone masters finally falling into imperial hands and being used, in a groundbreaking tactic, to make cloned stormtroopers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> short stories contradict the events of the published novels (most prominently the capture of the <em>Castilla</em> and the consequent powder burns on Hornblower's hand). C.S. Forester discouraged their reprinting because of this. He also did a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> on Hornblower's birthday (1771 to July 4, 1776) and the length of his friendship with Bush, along with <em>shortening</em> his acquaintance with his first wife, Maria—statements in earlier written novels imply that the marriage was due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Childhood Friend Romance</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35905');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35905" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35905');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with all the romance being on Maria's end</span> but <em>Lieutenant Hornblower</em> indicates that they first met as adults, when Hornblower was staying in the Masons' boarding house.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series there are assorted examples.
<ul><li> One of the notable ones involve prolong, the life extension treatment common to advanced societies. It isn't mentioned in the first book <em>On Basilisk Station</em>, and makes it appearance in the second, <em>The Honor of the Queen</em> when the Manticorans visit the less technologically advanced planet of Grayson, which doesn't have that medical technology. Third-generation prolong treatment is stated to extend <em>all</em> stages of human physical maturity, and people from Grayson are explicitly stated to be disturbed by the sight of a warship that looks like it's crewed by teenagers and even pre-teens. Although that particular comparison isn't mentioned again, there are some references later in the series that imply the same thing, such as when Queen Elizabeth III states she didn't start developing a bust until she was in her late 20s. Much later in the series, when the subject of prolong comes up, it's mentioned that recipients get treatment during childhood that cancels the effect so that they age at a normal human rate until they've reached physical maturity.
</li><li> In the first novel, Harrington herself is a competent but not necessarily noteworthy officer who superiors higher up the chain of command don't really know, and in subsequent novels gains a number of people trying to destroy her reputation and career. In the short story "Let's Dance", written many real-life years later but taking place chronologically about a year or so before <em>On Basilisk Station</em>, Harrington gains a measure of notoriety by assisting a known terrorist group in freeing some genetic slaves, creating a minor diplomatic kerfuffle and forcing the Navy to quietly send her off to command school to keep her away from the press and political opposition until things die down. At no point in the novels which take place later was this incident ever mentioned, even by her internal enemies who otherwise used every excuse, rumor, spin, and dirty trick to bring her down.
</li><li> In the first few novels, Harrington is described as winning in hand-to-hand combat due to her practice in martial arts and coming from a heavy-gravity world, while her deadly accuracy in a duel is due to single-minded relentless practice at a range. Later books and short stories in the series reveal that she's come from a family that's had some pretty extensive genetic engineering, giving her enhanced physical abilities that would have played a role.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>, the first book published in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>, implies that there are no humans in the land of Narnia, and Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy were the first humans ever to travel there; thus, they're greeted as heroes when they arrive, since they're (apparently) the first people capable of fulfilling the prophecy that four humans would free Narnia from the rule of the White Witch. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew">The Magician's Nephew</a></em> later establishes that there have been humans living in Narnia since its creation. The sequels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian">Prince Caspian</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em> take it further, revealing that there are multiple thriving human civilizations in Narnia, such as Archenland and Calormen; it's never explained why humans from either of those countries couldn't have fulfilled the prophecy instead. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4igr0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4igr0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4igr0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Some sources claim that the humans of Narnia had interbred with magical creatures, and the prophecy only applied to full-blooded humans. It's also possible that the humans of Narnia were (somehow) descended from humans other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Adam and Eve</a>, explaining why the Narnians call humans from our world "Sons of Adam" and "Daughters of Eve".</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a> was introduced. In later seasons, they get all obsessive about protecting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a> because "where else will the children learn about magic?", even though none of the other magical characters shown in the show up to that point went there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>
<ul><li> While it was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> in the first place, The Master was originally supposed to be 600 years old, and to have outgrown human features as a result of his age. However, a flashback showed him siring Darla approximately 400 years ago and looking the same, even though if he'd already stopped looking human at 200 Angel and Darla should have had the same look by the time of the series. The comics presented an alternate explanation for his appearance — while at the same time establishing him as at least 800 years old. And this explanation clashes with the similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok">Looks Like Orlok</a> appearance of a vampire called the Prince of Lies over on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>.
</li><li> There is also the issue of the Master being so old that his bones have solidified and don't turn to dust when he is staked by Buffy. This issue is made problematic by the appearance of Kakistos, a vampire so old that his hands are now cloven hooves. This implies that he's much older yet than even the Master. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Do ''you'' think his bones remain once he gets staked?</a>
</li><li> Though maybe that's just different vampires showing signs of aging at different ages, like humans going gray or bald at different ages, or only some older humans getting Alzheimer's.
</li><li> The different and unexplained look of werewolf Oz in Season 2 and Season 3.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em>, it's clear that all the aliens have all the powers, but Michael just isn't as good at using them. We even specifically see Michael heal someone's broken ankle. As the series went on, this drifted into them each having unique special powers to the point where Max being the only one able to heal people became a huge thing. This was presented as the way things had always been. This is most likely because the series started out sticking to the book series it was based on (where all of the aliens had the same broad range of powers), but soon developed into a completely different story line with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">the six main characters being the only thing consistent with the books</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> has this, mainly with the character of Grissom. In the early episodes, he is shown to be a quirky eccentric with lots of connections. However, by the next season he is a reclusive intellectual with traits of Asperger's.
<ul><li> In one season 3 episode Sara recollects how at one time she found a bag of something (which turned out to be her brother's weed) which she showed to her parents and unintentionally got him in big trouble. Said brother is never mentioned again, and indeed some later episodes strongly imply she is an only child.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first season episode "Raised By Another," a flashback shows Claire fretting that her mother will disown her if she tells her she's pregnant. The third season episode "Par Avion" reveals that Claire's mother was in a coma at the time.
</li><li> The Adam and Eve skeletons introduced in season 1 are implied to be 50 or so years old and we're left with the impression that they were some loving couple who died on the island. In season 6 we discover that the skeletons are hundreds of years old and belong to the smoke monster's original form and the crazy lady who pretended to be his and Jacob's mother.
</li><li> It's generally accepted by fans that the flashbacks in "Across the Sea" (where we discover the origins of the skeletons) take place around 1 AD. If this is true then the skeletons are around <em>2000</em> years old. That's a far cry from 20-50.
</li><li> Aaron and Walt's importance. Season 1 and season 2 make a point foreshadowing Walt's powers. It's a non-issue in his few appearances in the later seasons. Aaron's destiny was hinted to be fairly important when the psychic warned Claire he must not be "raised by another". He gets raised by another (Kate) and there seems to be none of the dire implications the psychic hinted at.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5alyg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5alyg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5alyg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though said psychic later admitted to Mr. Eko that he was a fraud, instead gathering info on people and then exploiting it.</span>
</li><li> There are some differences between how the Others act in early seasons compared to later on, which can be chalked up to the fact that the writers hadn't really decided what the Others <em>were</em> yet. In early appearances it seems like they were intended to have supernatural powers, most notable in Ethan's super strength and ability to pop up from out of nowhere. And while we're on the subject of Ethan, in season three Ben says that Ethan was their surgeon. Now, why would Ben send the Others' only surgeon on a dangerous mission to infiltrate the crash survivors (as he did Goodwin, who it seems he sent with the intention of getting him killed) a short time after he has found out that he has a lethal tumor on his spine? Also, in the first few seasons it was well established that the Others kidnap children, and we assume that this was the reason they took Rousseau's daughter, Alex.
</li><li> There's also the fact that Ethan is apparently one of the few who grew up on the island, which makes you wonder where he got his surgeon skills. Of course, considering that the whole surgeon thing is from a throwaway line in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">"Stranger in a Strange Land"</a>, perhaps we should just forget about it. And you have to wonder about the Others not kidnapping Jack and co when they went after Michael.
</li></ul></li><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> episode has Delenn and Lennier mentioning that Minbari society is made up of two castes: warrior and religious. Later episodes show that there is also a worker caste, which becomes very important when the Minbari start a civil war. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says "She just forgot to mention the worker caste. That's my story and I'm sticking to it." Just how often the other two castes forget the worker caste eventually became an important plot point. The in-canon novel "To Dream In the City of Sorrows" goes into more detail about the marginalization of the worker caste: there was an objection to them joining the Rangers, members of the other two castes would lose face if they spoke in worker dialect, and before Valen came there wasn't even a pretense of them being an equal caste.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has several, with the fans being far more forgiving of some than others. One essay calls these "<a class="urllink" href="http://stardestroyer.net/Empire/Essays/BrainBugs.html">Brain Bugs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" and posits that it's because of a long succession of writers either being unfamiliar with or flat-out misunderstanding what came before and as such, end up simplifying concepts and reading unintended meaning into minor details. Examples include:
<ul><li> Deanna Troi went from outright experiencing beings' emotions in the pilot to merely being aware of them.
</li><li> Q being several different beings with the same face (never actually stated, but it was the idea the writers had and the actor's performance in the TNG pilot bears it out).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original</a> pilot episode, it's Majel Barrett's first officer character "Number One" who represses emotion and acts on logic, and Spock (who's "just" alien) seems to be a very different character because of it. It also implied that faster-than-light travel was a new invention, when it was later established to have been invented much earlier. In TOS, the most common time-reference was that it was set about 200 years after the 1960s. Furthermore, there had been nuclear warfare on Earth after the 1960s. So it actually made some sense that warp drive, as of the time of Pike's first visit to Talos IV, would be a fairly new thing. (It also implied that some form of FTL travel existed other than warp drive, maybe natural gates or something, because of the Valient in "Where No Man Has Gone Before" and the Romulan War.) But all this kind of <em>worked</em>, because it gave the <em>feel</em> of a frontier, worlds not settled all that long, technology advancing but with the backwaters behind. TOS just simply does not fit, continuity-wise, with the other series.
</li><li> The hand-held communicators got larger between Enterprise and TOS, before shrinking to com-badges in TNG.
</li><li> The original series was very vague and contradictory about what century it was supposedly taking place in — offhand references implied the 22nd, 23rd and even the 28th centuries. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">The Wrath of Khan</a></em> finally cemented the setting as being in the 23rd century, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtyYearsFromNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtyYearsFromNow">exactly 300 years in the future</a> detail was established later.
</li><li> Most of the well-known races in <em>Trek</em> are wildly different from how they were originally conceived, beginning as a complex race and devolving, from one writer to the next, into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a>. The Ferengi, in their first appearance, were being set up as a fairly major military power; a few seasons later they were a much smaller power and quite cowardly, and by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>, they were, for all intents and purposes, not a military power at all, and their personality had withered down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">all profit all the time</a>. Their first appearance was the first reported visual (and possibly audio) contact with a Federation citizen, whereas by DS9 (less than half a decade later in the timeline) they had been an established economic presence in the quadrant for decades and had deep-seated ties with Klingons and Cardassians. Also, while DS9's Ferengi were often amoral scumbags, their outright evil TNG forebearers dressed in Klingon-esque primitive, fur-sashed mail uniforms, acted half-feral, executed second officers as a diplomatic act, and were stated to eat sapient beings. Not long after, they started wearing wide-collared suits, dressing more like modern humans than the Feds. Also, in several early Ferengi episodes, Troi claims to sense their feelings. Later on, Ferengi are immune to telepathy/empathy.
</li><li> Similarly, the Borg were, initially, all the same organic race. In the first episode they are introduced, incubators with Borg young are shown, and <em>assimilation</em> is used only in the sense of acquiring alien technology. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">The Best of Both Worlds</a>", they kidnap and assimilate Picard to act as a liaison to humans — but this is done surgically and with one particular purpose in mind. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">First Contact</a></em> (and their subsequent appearances on <em>Voyager</em>), they don't reproduce or even conduct scientific research of their own at all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">relying on assimilation alone</a> for both. However, one <em>Voyager</em> episode showed some Borg children who had come out of their development chambers early and so were only partially assimilated. It's possible that children who are assimilated are kept in the incubation chambers until they reach maturity, for whatever reason.
</li><li> In "Space Seed", Spock refers to the Eugenics War, which occurred in the 1990s, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>, whereas later episodes and spin-offs establish WWIII as taking place in the mid or late 21st Century. This was a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> when by the '90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessup">the USSR had decided to fold without, thankfully, engaging in a nuclear exchange with the US.</a> Greg Cox's Khan novels tried to retcon the Eugenics wars into a behind-the-scenes war when genetically-engineered supermen were not carving up the earth in the '90s.
</li><li> Klingons started off as a stand-in for the 1960s Soviet Union and were generally very pragmatic and duplicitous in their interactions with the Federation. Beginning with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> and a visual redesign of the species (which is a contentious topic all on its own), they started drifting more and more towards a "space viking" culture. By the time of <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and the TNG movies, they were always seen in battle armor no matter their role, were eating like wild animals (complete with the addition of prominent canine teeth), obsessed over honor and a glorious death in battle, and were basically a total reversal of the civilized but duplicitous Original Series incarnation.
</li><li> It should be noted that the Klingons virtually swapped characterization with the Romulans, who were depicted as honorable and noble warrior-officers. TNG and DS9 retooled them as a duplicitous, racist empire of fairly unsympathetic villains — hell, in the Decipher CCG adaptation, their main skill was literally <em>Treachery</em>.
</li><li> The makeup issues of various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> can be seen as this. In addition to the ridges-or-no-ridges Klingon and Romulan cases, several races underwent several adjustments on the way to their current depictions. The Trill are <em>completely</em> different to the point that a fan theory is that the name similarity may be coincidence, and even the Bajorans originally had little Y protrusions above their noses that they lost in the first third of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>'s first season.
</li><li> One of the weirdest examples involved the rank of a single character. Miles O'Brien was formally made a character (he had been seen as an extra before) in the second season, and wears the rank pips of a lieutenant, and is even addressed as such once. Later, characters started referring to him as "Chief" because his job was "transporter chief". Then came the episode "Family" in which a character refers to him as an enlisted man, despite his lieutenant pips still very clearly shown. Finally, in the sixth season, they changed his pips to a single "darkened" pip, indicating his enlisted status, and from then on the producers and writers have declared that he was, is, and always has been an enlisted man.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em>, Zefram Cochrane is shown as the man who not only created warp drive, but also conducted the first warp flight <em>and</em> made first contact with an extraterrestrial species shortly afterward. In the TOS episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E9Metamorphosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E9Metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a>", where the character originated, he was said to simply be the inventor of warp drive. No more, no less.
</li><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Prime Directive</a> started off as something like a principle of anthropological objectivity: how do you study a culture in its natural state? By not letting them know that you're there, obviously. It also allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Federation scientists</a> to avoid morally-dubious "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>" scenarios. But as the series progressed, it became treated more and more as a moral philosophy, until, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>, it finally assumed a near-mystical quality with Starfleet not wanting to interfere with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">destinies</a>" of primitive cultures.
</li><li> In "Where No Man Has Gone Before", the second <em>Trek</em> pilot, Spock says that one of his ancestors married a human female, implying some distant relative. Somewhere along the line they decided that Spock's mother was human, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">Maligned Mixed Marriage</a> of Spock's parents is now an essential part of his character. Why Spock avoided mentioning that his mother was human is left to the imagination, though it is possible that at that point he was just trying to cover up a part of his heritage he was ashamed of. Plus, it's not like he actually lied. One of his ancestors did marry a human female. It's just that the ancestor was his father.
</li><li> Another Spock example is that somehow in all his discussions of cultural differences it never came up that he grew up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">fully human (adopted) sister</a> who is incidentally one of the most famous Star Fleet officers in recent history. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Vulcan half-brother</a> that he never mentioned is at least acknowledged as a deliberate omission on his part in-universe.
</li><li> Comparing the instances where distance, time and warp factor are all mentioned, you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">wildly varying values</a> for how fast warp speed actually is. One velocity mentioned in the original <em>Star Trek</em> would have gotten the <em>Voyager</em> home within months. To mention another instance, in <em>Enterprise</em> warp 3 is more than ten times faster than warp 3 in <em>The Next Generation</em>. There is an official mathematical formula for calculating the warp speeds, but it seems like the show's own writers do not bother to use it. One get-out clause the writers have proposed is that warp speed definitions changed between TOS and TNG. ENT, being a prequel, presumably uses the original scale.
</li><li> When Bajorans were first introduced with Ensign Ro Laren on TNG, she wore her earring on her left ear. When the Bajorans were further fleshed out in DS9, they all wore the earring on the right, apparently due to the Bajoran belief that the "pagh" (essentially the soul) resides in the left ear. The novels state this was due to Ro Laren not following the main Bajoran religion, but still honoring their heritage, and this discourages vedeks from grabbing at her ear to read her "pagh".
</li><li> When <em>pon farr</em> was first mentioned in the Original Series episode, "Amok Time," it was explicitly referred to being a biological process particular to Vulcan males. This was further supported by Saavik's dialogue with David in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>, reinforcing that Vulcan males experience <em>pon farr</em> every seven years upon reaching maturity. And then <em>Enterprise</em> has T'Pol undergo <em>pon farr</em>. So either the definition was changed by the writers, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">there's something T'Pol isn't telling us</a>...
</li><li> In addition to the Trill make-up being very different between "The Host" and DSN, as mentioned above, the way symbiosis works is changed as well; in TNG, Odan is presented as the same person in a different body, rather than the melding of minds of the Dax hosts. Also, the very fact of symbiosis is a revelation, since until the events of the episode force them to, the Trill don't discuss this with outsiders. This is implied to be the caution of a species new to the Federation, but DSN reveals they've been part of the UFP for <em>centuries</em>, meaning they not only felt it necessary to keep the secret all that time, but succeeded in doing so until Odan (presumably) became the first joined Trill to die offworld. And Jadzia and other Trill in DSN don't act as though they've just been freed of a secret, they act as if this is just a fact about them they've no reason to hide. Finally, the episode ends with Odan trying to rekindle her relationship with Dr Crusher, something DSN would later present as a huge taboo in Trill society.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the Daleks first appeared they threatened a small tribe of people and, themselves, constituted just one group in an isolated city, and all died at the end. In their next appearance (supposedly set earlier in history), they had successfully conquered Earth itself. In their third appearance they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. In their fourth appearance, they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> and threatened Earth's entire galaxy (and probably other galaxies besides.) More significantly, the <em>origin</em> of the Daleks changed; they were originally the mutated survivors of a war, and were later shown to have been deliberately created by Davros.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ojo3');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ojo3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ojo3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is somewhat justified - Davros' creation of the Daleks was explained as originally designing a travel machine for the eventual mutated form of the Kaleds as a result of the war. He then just decided to mess around with the mutants to make them think as the Daleks now do.</span> <em>Destiny of the Daleks</em> straight-out describes them as <em>robots</em> rather than cyborgs. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Later episodes would promptly ignore this development</a>.) The kicker? Almost all these stories were written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation">Terry Nation</a>, who created the Daleks.
</li><li> The Time Lords, the Doctor's people, established as beings who never ever ever interfered with other planets, had the Doctor doing errands for them within two years of real time. This later got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> away as Time Lord covert ops missions. As well, after the Time Lords were introduced (previously the Doctor only belonged to a nameless and mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> species) he often ran into people and civilizations who knew of them.
</li><li> <em>Doctor Who</em> continuity now runs on pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Time War</a> thrown in for good measure.
</li><li> In the earliest seasons, the Doctor is stated to be from another planet but repeatedly refers to himself and his granddaughter as human beings. His first regeneration is said to be made possible by the power of the TARDIS; and even though the Second Doctor appears to have some strange attributes like being 450 years old, he still claims to be human — or at most, ambiguously "more than human" because of his extensive time traveling experience. It's only in the Third Doctor era that he's explicitly established as an alien with clearly nonhuman physiology (two hearts, etc).
</li><li> When the mythic Time Lord Rassilon is first mentioned in <em>The Deadly Assassin</em>, the Doctor has apparently never heard of him. As the backstory of Rassilon evolved over the years, this became less and less believable, until it currently appears that Rassilon is not only as famous as, say, Jesus, but that the Doctor knew him <em>personally</em>.
</li><li> It is now generally accepted that Timelords automatically regenerate when mortally injured, but it wasn't until the FIFTH regeneration that this happened. Hartnell was renewed by 'part of the Tardis'. Troughton suffered a 'change of appearance' (often supposed now to be a <em>forced</em> regeneration triggered by what was effectively an execution). Pertwee only regenerated after being given a nudge by Kanpo (although it's finally termed 'regeneration'). Tom Baker merged with a mystical future version of himself. Only with Davison's regeneration onwards has the process been regular and automatic (and even Davison's Doctor questioned whether his death would trigger regeneration — "I might regenerate — I don't know".) In "The War Games" we even see a Time Lord get shot and he just dies, no regeneration. "Last of the Time Lords" has the Master choose not to regenerate, and Time Lords get shot in "Day of the Doctor" without regenerating (the implication is that Dalek weaponry is anti-regenerative, although there have also been episodes indicating that a severe enough injury can kill a Time Lord outright; plus given that the context is war those Time Lords being seen killed may have already exhausted their 13-life limit).
</li><li> Time Lord sexuality has swung back and forth over the years. The First Doctor was a wholesome but sexual being — he had a romantic subplot with a woman in a first season episode and a granddaughter, with no implication she came from any route other than the standard way one creates granddaughters (and she had her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Boys of the Week</a> and was shown to like kissing people). The Second Doctor flirted with Astrid in "Enemy of the World" for no reason other than pleasure. The Third Doctor flirted with Liz a <em>lot</em> and had Jo and Sarah as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interests</a>, while the Master often used his sexuality as a weapon (like in "The Mind of Evil" and "The Time Monster") with a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> with the Doctor tossed into the mix. The Fourth Doctor was less sexual than his predecessor due to his alien nature ("you're a beautiful woman, probably") but still had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Sarah, Leela and both Romanas (especially the second). None of this was treated as any big deal — it was simply there as part of the character, and never in focus due to its unimportance (plus network restrictions given that the BBC considered <em>Doctor Who</em> a children's programme). But by the 80s, production team members who felt the Doctor should be above such human concerns began to take charge. It's also not a coincidence that these concerns also surfaced after hiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a>, an actor much closer in age with his co-stars (the previous four Doctors' actors were 15-30 years older than their companions), giving rise to fears that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Mary Whitehouse</a> would add "sexual innuendo" to the charges on her rap sheet against the show. Phrases like "no hanky-panky in the TARDIS" were coined and the producer enforced a policy of the Doctor not even being allowed to touch or look at his companions in case people got the wrong idea. By this point the Doctor was considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexual">Asexual</a> by the show, the fandom and the mainstream media, and people were beginning to suspect that Time Lords as a species were just above that sort of thing — and so when the TV Movie had the Eighth Doctor giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a> to a human woman purely for the pleasure of it, fans tore out their hair and cried. The book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresLungbarrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresLungbarrow">Lungbarrow</a></em> came out after the movie and semi-canonised the idea of 'looms', a system of asexual reproduction for Time Lords that generates full adults, while another novel cast doubt on the Doctor actually having a biological granddaughter. The new series pinged right back to the idea of Time Lords being sexual, showing children, talking about the Doctor's parents and wives, and makes the Doctor's sexuality and sexualisation a major theme of his character.
</li><li> Whether "Time Lord" is the name of the race from Galifrey or a subset of them has drifted in and out over time. The classic series originally implied that they were all Time Lords, and then later episodes introduced Galifreyans who were pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> (including primitive cultures living on the same planet). The revived series reverted to using it as the name of the race - with the Eleventh Doctor episode "A Good Man Goes to War" even establishing the existence of a specific form of Time Lord DNA - until the Twelth Doctor's run started making the distinction again, and even then the term is used to refer to both the few individuals with the rank and also the culture in general.
</li><li> Susan is a character who especially stands out as someone from a completely different show. She makes a lot of sense as the granddaughter of a mysterious old man time traveller who is likely a human (albeit from another planet), and less sense as the granddaughter of an asexual two-hearted Time Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a> from an ancient world that influences the workings of the universe. There is no real in-story reason to explain why the Doctor never went back to see her, either — at least not until her implied death in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a>, anyway.
</li><li> Clara has also been accused of continuity drift, given how over the course of 2 1/2 seasons she changed from being a computer illiterate nanny to being someone nearly as powerful as the Doctor himself and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>. Defenders simply reply that this is character development, and that while it may have only been 2 1/2 seasons on screen, the passage of time for Clara is somewhat greater (with an implied 2-3 year time jump between Series 7 and the 50th anniversary special).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica (1978)</a></em>: The war with the Cylons has been going on for millennia, except when it's been going on for only many years. One episode specifically says Starbuck was orphaned about 20 years ago, in one of the first Cylon raids.
</li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>:
<ul><li> The miniseries says that after the first Cylon war, the Cylons left and made their home on a distant planet. This is brought up again in Season 2 when it is explained that the Resurrection Ships allow Cylons to download into new bodies when far from the Cylon homeworld. After that, the idea seems to have been quietly dropped. Season 4 introduces a spaceborne "Resurrection Hub," which is said to be essential to all Cylon resurrection everywhere, and the homeworld is never mentioned. In the last few episodes, this is brought up again, although it is changed a bit more: the Cylons had been living on the 'Colony', which was more like a large space station than a planet.
</li><li> This trope can sort of be applied to the show's visual effects, too. At the beginning of the series — the miniseries through to Season 2 — there was a lot of emphasis on the spacecraft behaving like spacecraft actually would, with noticeably unique — and awesome because of it — space battles in amongst the politics and drama. From Season 3 onwards, the battles got gradually more and more glitzy and dominated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. The battle of the Colony, the final battle of the series, had much more in common with the destruction of the second Death Star than the more understated and nuanced battles in the first two series.
</li><li> Six's glowing spine that lights up during sex in the mini.
</li><li> The population of the 12 Colonies was stated as 20 Billion in the <em>Resistance</em> webisodes. Season 4 mentioned that the population was 50 Billion. It's an easy one to miss, as not many people have seen <em>The Resistance</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> When the Genii first appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, they appeared to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish">Space Amish</a> society until it was discovered they were actually far more advanced and kept it a secret by living in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Bases</a>. Teyla, who had been friends with the Genii for years, complained that they never told her and they replied "that is our way". Several episodes later, the Genii were making no effort to hide their advancements and by the fifth season it seemed to be common knowledge that they were a major power.
<ul><li> This is plausibly explained as them simply abandoning their secrecy since it had already gotten out. With the Atlantis expedition knowing the truth about them and considering them enemies (and therefore quite likely to blow their cover anyway), what would be the point of keeping up the ruse?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, Hester comes off very differently in her appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> than in her flashbacks and stories in <em>Frasier</em>. She threatens to kill Diane, for one thing, while on <em>Frasier</em> she was always touted as a bastion of class and common sense (although this could be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">Never Speak Ill of the Dead</a>). Also, she seems to be a rather soft-spoken, frail, grandmotherly woman who Frasier treats with great gentleness and care on <em>Cheers</em>, whereas she was described as a bold, intimidating matriarch on <em>Frasier</em>. Frasier's claims on <em>Cheers</em> that he's an only child and his father is a dead psychiatrist were eventually explained as him being in a bad mood with his family and just lying.

In the early years of the show, Topanga was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> whose crush on a very unamused Cory was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. Later, there are many references to them having been totally in love since they were in Pull-Ups. She <em>is</em> shown in an early episode giving him his first kiss though. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> later by saying that Cory and Topanga were best friends when they were really little until Cory was teased by other little boys for the friendship. As a result, he abandoned the friendship and didn't rediscover his feelings for Topanga until puberty. At one point, his big brother even takes credit (laughing about it) for convincing little Cory that girls were gross, contributing to the temporary split with Topanga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> starts off saying that Lister never dated Kochanski, but later says that he did but that it wasn't very successful. The reason for this is that the episode where he says he did date her is based on part of the spin-off book "Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers" which takes place in a somewhat alternate continuity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>
<ul><li> In the episode "The One With The Prom Video", Chandler appears to be seeing Fat Monica and college age Ross's perm for the first time, just like Joey, and mocks College!Ross's music. Later flashbacks would establish that Chandler was Ross's roommate at the time, spent Thanskgiving with the Gellers, was in Ross's band and after some hairy incidents also became friends with Monica. He only lives across the hall because Monica tipped him off that the apartment was free.
</li><li> The age of the friends also changes. Season 1 has Monica and Rachel say they're 26, making Ross, Chandler and Joey 27. (Phoebe is murkier). However by Season 7 Monica and Rachel are 30, and the guys are 31, making them 24 and 25 in Season 1, which is supported by flashbacks of the dates they attended high school/college. It looks like in early seasons the writers planned for the characters to be older, realized it didn't work and lopped a few years off everyone's ages.
</li></ul></li><li> In the earliest episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>, Brennen's ex-husband was introduced for a scene and it was implied their divorce was recent; this was in keeping with the books, where her ex-husband was mentioned frequently and occasionally appeared. After Brennen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">characterisation marched on</a> and she became a walking example of Asperger's clichés, mentions of her previous marriage were quietly dropped.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>, vampires have the ability to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> to erase memories. Their blood also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> when consumed. It wasn't until later in the series that the writers put two and two together and realised that vampires could simply mind control a human into letting them drink their blood, feed them some blood in return, erase their memories and send them on their way without having to worry about getting caught. Once this strategy was established, some characters who should know better (and do, in flashbacks) suddenly look like amateurs in the early seasons, such as Damon making Caroline wear a scarf to hide her bite marks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, a throwaway line in the episode "Noël" apparently establishes that Toby Ziegler is a veteran of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, and possibly even a recipient of the Purple Heart. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61gqu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note61gqu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61gqu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Toby's actor, Richard Schiff, was born two years after the Korean War ended, so Toby would have to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingGertrude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingGertrude">significantly older than his actor</a> in order for this to be possible</span> Not only did this aspect of his character never come up again, it was later explicitly contradicted in "Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail", where Toby recalls protesting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> when he was still too young to drive.
<ul><li> This is actually a misunderstanding (albeit a common one). In referring to how how little help the veteran he was talking about received, it <em>sounds</em> like Toby says "I got better treatment at Panmunjom." However, the line is <em>supposed</em> to be "Guy got better treatment at Panmunjom." Coming out quickly and without a lot of enunciation, many people misinterpret it.

<ul><li> Some early episodes are a bit inconsistent about what Wallace's full name is, and the writers seem to have waffled on whether "Wallace" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">his first name or his last name</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">one time</a> we meet his mother in Season 1, Freamon addresses her as "Mrs. Wallace", suggesting that it's the latter. But if you pay close attention in Season 3, there's also a photo of him in the police station captioned "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Wallace Wikes</a>", suggesting the former. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7vtn0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7vtn0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7vtn0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A somewhat common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> among fans is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">it's his middle name</a>, taken from his mother's maiden name.</span>
</li><li> During the basketball game in Season 1, Avon makes a crack suggesting that "Proposition Joe" is illiterate. While it's certainly possible that Avon was just insulting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a>, Joe doesn't bother to tell him off, and his response seems to imply that he actually <em>is</em> illiterate. This is pretty hard to reconcile with later episodes, which establish that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Joe is quite well-educated</a>, and he was a star student in his youth.
</li><li> In Omar Little's very first appearance, he briefly gets angry at his boyfriend Brandon for accidentally revealing his name during a robbery, implying that none of the Barksdales had ever heard of him before that point. By the end of Season 1, however, it's well-established that he's an in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">living legend</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">universally feared</a> by the gangsters of Baltimore—and in most subsequent episodes, he's treated as if he's been that way for <em>years</em>. By Season 4, most drug dealers instinctively flee from him in terror, even when he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">unarmed and in his bathrobe</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975">Wonder Woman</a></em>: During Season 1, Wonder Woman was the main character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Diana Prince</a> serving as a secretary only to get information on where she was needed. She frequently visited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Paradise Island</a> and traveled in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">invisible jet</a>. Seasons 2 and 3 feature Agent Diana Prince who is the IADC's top agent largely because she can become Wonder Woman when the occasion requires. The invisible jet last appears in "The Man Who Could Move the World", the second episode of season 2. In "The Man Who Could Not Die", one of the last episodes of the series, she even says: "In a lot of ways, Wonder Woman is more alone than you are." That's a very long way from the pilot, "The New Original Wonder Woman", with regular invisible jet travel anywhere in the world and an entire island of amazon sisters where she is a member of the royal family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>:
<ul><li> The details of Troy's backstory change slightly between Season 1 and Season 4. At the beginning of the show, we're told that he wound up at Greendale after he dislocated both shoulders while attempting to do a keg-stand ("Keg-<em>flip</em>!") at a graduation party, which cost him his football scholarship to a prestigious college—although he later admits in "Football, Feminism, and You" that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he intentionally injured himself because he couldn't handle the pressure of being a big-time college athlete</span>. But in the flashback to the graduation party in "Heroic Origins", we see that he actually just <em>pretended</em> to hurt himself, and was never really injured at all; his "injury" was also apparently a twisted ankle, not two dislocated shoulders.
</li><li> "Introduction to Statistics" includes a brief throwaway line apparently establishing that Pierce's father is dead. This is later contradicted by "Advanced Gay", where his father Cornelius Hawthorne appears and plays a major role in the story. "The Psychology of Letting Go" makes it especially obvious that his father wasn't initially supposed to be alive: the main plot revolves around the death of Pierce's mother, but there's never any indication that she left behind a grieving husband, and her recorded farewell message is only addressed to her son.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note83ryv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note83ryv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note83ryv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Said farewell message also ends with a recorded hip-hop song; it's pretty hard to imagine the militantly racist Cornelius Hawthorne marrying a woman who listens to hip-hop.</span>
</li><li> In Abed's short film in "Introduction to Statistics", a photo of his mother is briefly visible; she appears to be Middle Eastern, likely meaning that both of his parents are of Arab descent. Later on, multiple episodes establish that Abed's mother is Polish, and Abed is biracial (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorSharedBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorSharedBackground">like</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyPudi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyPudi">Danny Pudi</a>).

<ul><li> Much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em>'s early media got contradicted, at times very early on, due to its inconsistent nature. This is because originally, LEGO didn't know that the line would be one of their long runners, and the line was one of their first full-blown multimedia franchises, so its continuity had a rough start.
<ul><li> Some inconsistencies were actually planned for — for example the original backstory being revealed as a legend forged by the village priests.
</li><li> Early card games described characters and history completely differently than what was seen in the comics and online content. Most of the discrepancies have simply been declared non-canon, or examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisingOnlyContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisingOnlyContinuity">Advertising-Only Continuity</a>.
</li><li> When LEGO was forced to change the name of the villagers from Tohunga to Matoran for legal reasons, they gave it a story justification, but after a while stated that Matoran has always been their name.
</li><li> The canisters that the Toa arrived to the island in were originally stated to have fallen into the sea when Takua gathered the Toa Stones, and supposedly Kapura was there to witness it. Later, it was explained that the canisters had been floating in the ocean for a 1000 years, and the Stones have only <em>beckoned</em> them to the island. Kapura, at the time when the cans were originally launched, had been lying comatose in a storage sphere, along with the rest of the islanders.
</li><li> The three virtues, Unity, Duty and Destiny, were introduced in the third year, even though later material explained that they have been the most fundamental parts of the universe all along. They've been retroactively written into the "Legend of Mata Nui" backstory after that.
</li><li> One of the 2003 comics claimed that Makuta has been gone for years following his defeat. Later, they established that the entire umbrella arc of 2001-2003 happened in less than a single year in-story.
</li><li> According to the first novel (which contains numerous continuity issues), Gali was the only Toa not to see her village before she met up with her brothers. Later, the <em>Encyclopedia</em> claimed that going there was her first action upon arriving to the island. The <em>Encyclopedia</em> actually overwrote much of the first novel and some other story sources as well in an effort to tie the story presented in the fragmented multimedia together, and also to implement the personal ideas of its writer over those of some previous writers.
</li><li> The Mata Nui island's population was fourteen characters per each of the six villages, and media from 2001 and '02 mostly stayed true to this. Then the '03 movie showed hundreds, while the '04 movie thousands, if not tens of thousands of citizens across the entire island, forcing the writers to pretend the actual number has always been exactly one thousand, plus their leaders and protectors. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fans then began theorizing</a> there were more than six villages per region and we just never saw the rest.
</li><li> Originally, timeframes spanning thousands of years were considered vast, things from three millennia ago were outright ancient. Then the writers began throwing around a hundred thousand years nonchalantly, claiming almost every character has lived that long, if not longer.
</li><li> Protodermis was first presented as a unique material living things are made out of, one which had to be mined. Post-2003 lore retconned protodermis as the stuff that makes up nearly everything, including metal, flesh and artificial water.
</li><li> Though not outright stated, most characters early on were implied to be robotic. The toys looked like robots, and the above mentioned protodermis was intended to be the "living metal" they were made out of. When the Bohrok appeared, the fact that they were bio-mechanical (robots with organic elements) was commented on as an oddity. Merely one year later, it was explained that <em>all</em> living characters were partially organic themselves, made of metallic and organic protodermis, and the Bohrok (and later character types like Rahkshi or Vahki) were fully robotic apart from the organic creatures controlling them.

<ul><li> In the first game, Phoenix Wright, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being arrested</span>, says that he'd never imagined the possibility of him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being a defendant</span>. The third game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">flashback case taking place before the first game</a> where, surprise surprise, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phoenix is the defendant</span>. This line is fixed in the 3DS re-release — Phoenix instead says he never imagined the possibility of "becoming the defendant for this case". Specially in the original, his line was him stating he never thought he'd "end up in the defendant's chair" himself. So it's likely he WAS referring to that specific case only, but it was just worded badly.
</li><li> In the first game, when Phoenix and Grossberg first meet, it's implied they never met, even though he appears in the first case of the third game, which is a flashback. Though it could be argued Grossberg never got a good look at Phoenix (who was wearing a surgical mask due to a cold), and Phoenix could have been hopped up on cold medicine and forgot the less-important parts of the trial. They also didn't interact meaningfully in that flashback case.

In the Throne of Bhaal we meet a fully grown dragon of about the your age (20 years) and even with mature offspring by his side. At least what your stepfather's letter told you about your mother may be explained away as an attempt to not further upset you.
<ul><li> Except there's nothing saying that all the Bhaalspawn are the same age. After all, Bhaal's death had been foretold centuries earlier, presumably he could've started making heirs early enough for a dragon to grow up.

However as the prequels were released (namely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>) many details of the series' backstory (such as Big Boss' age and military career prior to joining FOXHOUND, Frank Jaeger's country of origin, Master Miller's heritage and the fact that there were Metal Gears before the TX-55 in the first MSX2 game) were changed to the point that they no longer sync with the MSX games. <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> does an admirable job in linking the frayed story threads, though <em>Portable Ops</em> had to be struck from the 'verse's canon.
<ul><li> Curiously, if Naked Snake dies at any point during <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, the words "SNAKE IS DEAD" slowly change to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">TIME PARADOX</a>".

By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em>, this is no longer the case, with one character even lampshading that "it seems like everyone has one of those things these days". Similarly, the original game claims that the Keyblade chooses its master, but <em>Birth by Sleep</em> shows that people become Keyblade wielders because other Keyblade wielders choose them as successors and make them undertake a rite of passage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">The first</a> game pretty heavily implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">the Heartless</a> are (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">as the name implies</a>) people who've lost their hearts after being corrupted by Darkness. Hence, the climax of the game pretty clearly shows Sora <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becoming a Heartless</span> after he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sacrifices his heart to save Kairi</span>, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becoming human again</span> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kairi uses her magic to restore his heart</span>. But then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> establishes that Heartless <em>do</em> have hearts, and that people don't become Heartless themselves; their <em>hearts</em> become Heartless after being corrupted by negative emotions and detaching from their bodies, while the heartless shell left behind is called a "Nobody".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9a61a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9a61a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9a61a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To sum up: the terms are <em>exactly</em> backward.

</li><li> The original game outright states that its central gimmick of traveling between various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate universes</a> should normally be impossible (even with the aid of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSpaceship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSpaceship">Gummi Ship</a>), and that Sora and co. are only able to do it because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">the Heartless</a>' invasion causing the barriers between worlds to break down. But then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> complicates this by revealing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">King Mickey</a> and Ansem the Wise are long-time friends, despite being from two different worlds. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> <em>Birth By Sleep</em> complicates it further, establishing that Keyblade wielders were casually traveling between worlds with "Keyblade Gliders" long before the Heartless came along.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> series has gone through this in regards to the main alien enemies, the Ceph. In the first game, they were jellyfish-like blue critters that thrived happily in very, very low temperatures and environments with little gravity. In fact, they considered Earth inhospitable enough that you never fought them in person outside a controlled environment. Also, most of their weapons were cold-based. Come the second game and they're orange, walking around outside with the help of powered armor, no longer seem to mind the temperature, and use fusion-type weaponry and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">biological warfare</a> as opposed to their original cryo-weaponry. As the aliens in the second game are very effective villains, opinion is divided as to whether or not these changes were for the better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em> has Herman Toothrot (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em>) be revealed as Elaine's grandfather, H.T. Marley. This would be a genius retcon were it not for the facts surrounding Marley's arrival on the island contradicting Herman's. This is the main reason the game has such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>: Most of the games made before <em>Phantasmagoria of Flower View</em> don't fit well with later canon. The first five have just been ignored. The sixth through eighth are definitely canon, but present the setting of Gensoukyou as a large place, filled with mystery and danger, while later worldbuilding would establish it as fairly small, generally understood, and most of the danger being posed only to non-natives.
<ul><li> Also noticeable is that things got much more Japanese. In the earlier games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> had Western names unless they had a good reason not to, and then all of a sudden the reverse is true. The largest group of offenders got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into having come from outside, but there's still a decent number of characters with names that look out of place now.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, Cerberus was presented as a dastardly lot carrying out unethical experimentation for little good reason and a rogue Alliance military Black Ops unit. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> came about and players were forced to work with them, Cerberus was now an independent well-funded but fairly small group, with Shepard's resurrection and the construction of the SR-2 <em>Normandy</em> taking up a huge portion of their resources, and the members with which you now encountered being more moral sorts. Attempts were made to paper over the difference by claiming those that appeared in the first game were rogue elements. Not everyone bought the explanation. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> revealed that the Illusive Man collected the most sympathetic members he could find to manipulate Shepard, and Cerberus was a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">N.G.O. Superpower</a> that could outfit a respectable battlefleet. There were multiple clues to this in the second game as well (mostly buried in the Codex), and it was always clear in the novels; whether Shepard fell for it or not is up to the player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, the earliest content contained several references to the setting's ultimate power being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">cabal of unseen beings</a> referred to only as "The Council," who were implied to be the collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> of the game's creators. They were suggested to be above all the governments seen in the game and respected by even the gods. They aren't mentioned anymore and it's since been well-established that Gielinor's most powerful beings are a group of alien deities known as the Elder Gods.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> created some with regards to the nature of the resonance cascade. From playing just the first game and its expansion packs, one would think the cascade was just a local event, only afffecting the Black Mesa complex and possibly parts of the surrounding New Mexico desert. Half Life 2 reveals that it opened portals across the world and allowed the Combine to enter our universe, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">Seven Hour War</a> and the Combine conquering the planet. This raises several questions, the biggest being: why bother trying to cover up what happened in Black Mesa if the whole world was conquered by aliens shortly after, which would obviously be pretty hard for people to miss. It's posssible the cover up was more about hiding the fact that humans were behind the whole thing, however.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> It's explicitly stated that the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Prime Evils</a> are different ages, with Mephisto being the oldest, Diablo being youngest, and Baal in the middle (although this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">doesn't have any effect on their general power level in game)</a>. Lore released when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> expansion pack came out revealed that all seven Great Evils started out as heads of a seven headed dragon Tathamet, who was destroyed in a fight with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCounterpart">Good Counterpart</a> Anu, with her heads each turning into one of the Great Evils, meaning they'd all have to be the same age.

In a blog post, Herbert says the original 4th chapter gave a history that conflicted with the one mentioned in the About page, so he changed everything around at the last second.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>: In one early conversation between Karkat and Sollux, the two trolls insult each other by saying that the other is repulsive to the opposite sex, and on another occasion, Feferi immediately assumes that Eridan's crush is female, before considering that it might be male. Both of these conversations seem to imply that troll society is heteronormative; however, it is later established that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">trolls are all bisexual</a>, and don't even have a word for monosexuality. It's not too hard to come up with an in-universe justification — it would be consistent with canon if some characters had mild preferences for one gender, and all of those characters had opposite-sex love interests — but it's clear that Hussie hadn't come up with the idea of all trolls being bi until later on.
<ul><li> Similarly, it's later established that gender is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender">purely aesthetic</a> to trolls with no different reproductive capabilities and no real social or cultural attachments. However, early pages in Hivebent seem to disagree with this, such as in one moment where Tavros was hurt and Karkat yelled at him to 'STOP PLAYING GAMES FOR GIRLS'. Theories have been imagined, including one rather popular one that women actually tend to be more aggressive and that Karkat wasn't insulting his choice of game so much as his ability to play something so dangerous, but it's still almost certainly drift going on here.
</li><li> And there's the matter of the trolls' blood-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a>. Later it turned out to be an integral part of their society with castes strictly enforced. Very early on, though, the hierarchy was portrayed much more casually, with Sollux even being unaware of the order the colours go in.

There have been few explicit retcons, if any, but implications from earlier seasons—such as every Freelancer having an AI—have been proven incorrect—there were less than ten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> implanted in agents. More notable are several statements from the miniseries Out of Mind inconsistent with later series, which has largely been dismissed as messed-up or misinterpreted memories of Tex.

In the first two seasons he was said to have ruled during the first 70 years or so of the war, but come season 3 it is established that he only ruled for the first 20 years. Also a brief backstory released on the nick.com website implies that he was a young man who only recently became Fire Lord at around the time Avatar Roku died, but it is later established that Roku and Sozin were the same age and that Sozin had already been Fire Lord for a reasonable period by the time of Roku's death.
<ul><li> Katara mentions that an abandoned Fire Navy ship had been around since her grandmother was a little girl. By the end of the season, we learn that she didn't even live in the Southern Water Tribe until she was around 16-21.
</li><li> Koh the face stealer mentioned that a previous Avatar attempted to kill him around 800-900 years ago, however we later learn that the Avatar he was talking about was Avatar Kuruk who lived only about 450 years ago.

Then it turns out the Autobots and Decepticons were created by Primus, who was built by Primacon, and the Quintessons just want to punish or destroy the Autobots and Decepticons. Or the Quintessons and Primacon have nothing to do with their origin, and their origin story is "Primus created the Autobots and Decepticons."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> introduced the idea that the Maximals and Predacons were the same as the Autobots and Decepticons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>, only in new bodies that can transform into animal forms instead of vehicles. Later, it was established that these were not the original Autobots and Decepticons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The pilot episode stated that all jobs were selected for everyone by the government, everyone had "job chips" implanted in their hands, and leaving your job was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">punishable by death</a>. In later episodes, the job chips seem to function mostly as a form of ID, with everyone taking the job they want. A later episode lampshades this when they are fired from Planet Express and take up their old jobs again by having Leela explain the concept of career chips to a dumbfounded Fry.
</li><li> At the end of the pilot, the main characters are escaping the police and President Nixon in an explosion of fireworks. This issue is never brought back up in the following episodes.
</li><li> An early episode had Bender joining a robot religion led by Preacher Bot and swearing off alcohol for the religiously acceptable synthetic oil. And yet the very first episode established that alcohol is <em>necessary</em> for a robot to function (there's even a legal limit that robots have to be above), and Preacher Bot is even seen handing out alcohol to homeless robots in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, making Bender's insistence that alcohol is unacceptable to Robotologists questionable. It's possible that Bender misunderstood a restriction ("Do not indulge in alcohol to excess") as an outright prohibition ("Do not indulge in alcohol period"), or that as a new convert he is taking an extreme position in an excess of zeal. It may be worth noting that in <em>Mother's Day</em> Cardbot's description of the glorious robot worker's paradise <em>does</em> include an outright prohibition on alcohol, which is what motivates Bender to defect. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10y5xz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10y5xz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10y5xz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Let's just say that <em>many</em> religious sects could be seen as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> restrictions into prohibitions in that manner. </span>
</li><li> In the pilot Bender was also shown to be a good and moral robot, who only "went bad" after his programming got scrambled by electricity from a burst lightbulb. Later it's rather clear that he's always been his normal violent and klepto self from the remainder of the show, and that Mom seemingly programs all bending units in that manner - as seen in the episode <em>Mother's Day</em> when the "see through the eyes of a bending unit" highlight potential theft and exploitation targets.
</li></ul></li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>, Virgil/Static would make several references to other superheroes as fictional characters, remarking ''Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Clark Kent</a> had a day job." Later on, however, the show is very firmly established in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Quilby's</span> past whereabouts before being imprisoned changes between episodes 20 and 24 of season 2.

However, during a flashback in episode 23, a large army of Mechasms are seen in the sky during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Quilby's imprisonment</span> And since it's true that Orgonax was the only mechasm on the World of Twelve during that period, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Quilby</span> couldn't have been on the Zinit to research alien creatures if he was imprisoned back on his homeworld.
</li><li> Early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> pretty strongly imply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Shendu</a> is the only demon sorcerer of his kind, and they generally portray him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan-like</a> figure with command of a wide range of magical powers; hence, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower">twelve talismans</a> can grant everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">invisibility</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">super speed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatVision">heat vision</a>. Later, as the show's mythology becomes fleshed out, it's well-established that he's one of <em>eight</em> demon sorcerers with their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">elemental powers</a>, and that he's strictly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">the demon of fire</a>. To get around this, later episodes seldomly refer to the talismans as "The Talismans of Shendu", generally just calling them "the talismans".
</li><li> In the devil's first two appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>, he is only referred to "<em>Him</em>" because he's so evil the other characters can't bring themselves to say his true name. After that, his name is apparently actually Him.
</li><li> A few early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> explicitly state that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Chucky's mother</a> is still alive, but they occasionally imply that she and Chaz are divorced. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11qcvb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11qcvb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11qcvb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In "Real or Robots", Didi mentions waiting for Chucky's mom to pick him up after a sleepover with Tommy. And in "My Friend Barney", Chaz rather nonchalantly mentions that his wife never liked a fish trophy that he used to hang on his wall, and doesn't much sound like a grieving widower.</span> Later on, the Mother's Day episode established that she died of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease">an unspecified illness</a> when Chucky was an infant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> has continuity that got looser as it went on, but it did pop up sometimes.
<ul><li> In his first appearance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons">Oh Yeah! Cartoons</a></em> shorts, it's implied that Cosmo and Wanda are meeting Jorgen for the first time. The series proper establishes that they've known each other long before hand, and Jorgen's a prominent figure, making this first interaction strange.
</li><li> In early episodes, losing your fairies did not equate losing your memory of them. This only started in season 3.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> animated series, Angel makes his first appearance in the Season 1 episodes "The Cure" and "Come the Apocalypse". In the latter episode Angel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually Mystique disguised as Angel</span> encounters Cyclops and Professor X in a bar and the whole scene is written as if Angel has never met the X-Men before. However, a flashback in the Season 3 episode "Xavier Remembers" shows him alongside Cyclops as part of the original five like his comic counterpart.
