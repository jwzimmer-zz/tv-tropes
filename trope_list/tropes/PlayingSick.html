Most often, this is to avoid something unpleasant at school or work, such as a test, visit from management, or similar inconvenience. Some just do it to get a day off, and some just want attention. This is often accompanied by completely overblown "symptoms", often exaggerated further by the character holding a thermometer up to a light bulb to fake a temperature.
</p><p>In comedy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">this almost never works</a>, with the ruse either being readily discovered or backfiring on the character. A backfire might be whatever they were trying to avoid being moved to a day not covered by their ploy; it's also common for the character to end up missing out on something fun. Another risk is that the character may be compelled to take medicine or otherwise submit to medical treatment, as unpleasant and counterproductive as such things may be for someone who is not in fact sick.

</p><p>For added irony, it is rather common for someone who's playing sick to <em>actually</em> get sick somewhere along the way. This is often depicted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>.

An even more serious version of this is Self Infliction of Wounds to avoid combat. Depending upon the circumstances, malingering can be construed as Misbehavior Toward the Enemy, which can be a capital offense.
</p><p>See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MunchausenSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MunchausenSyndrome">Münchausen Syndrome</a> for the more serious, even pathological version.

Umaru-chan</a></em>, Umaru fakes a fever (by rubbing the thermometer against her side rapidly to heat it up via friction) so she can stay home from school and play video games. After seeing how hard her brother Taihei worked to take care of her, she felt guilty and confessed to the trick, earning his ire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, Kagome's absences from school to go time-traveling in Feudal Japan are attributed to increasingly bizarre illnesses that still somehow manage to fool her friends. Maybe she should try for some smarter friends...
</li><li> Meta example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> where the <em>author</em> feigned illness as an excuse for why volume 5 lacked any jokes on the inside cover.
</li><li> Konata of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> often makes up different excuses to skip school, including playing sick. So much so, that when she actually does get sick, she gets hit with accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> had one of these happen in the early episodes, where the main girl's friends ditch her so she could go on a date, and one of them played sick. When suspected after insisting the main character to go, she just said she was just pushing herself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MoonSubaruSolitudeStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MoonSubaruSolitudeStanding">MOON  Subaru Solitude Standing</a></em> has the titular heroine use pneumonia as an excuse to not go on a dance tour of her troupe. She's suspected of faking, as people see her out shopping. She wasn't faking the pneumonia and has a relapse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular">No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!</a></em> has Tomoko think to herself how she will do this to avoid going on the field trip in her second year, beginning by mentioning how she feels unwell three days before the trip, then have a worsening cough... so she can stay at home and just play games.
</li><li> The plot of an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> episode starts off with Kaoru pretending to be sick so that he could set Hikaru up with Haruhi on a date. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> with Tamaki getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">jealous</a> and the rest of the club trying to help the date go well.
</li><li> The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> is made of this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lil' Slugger is essentially a means of feigning injury in order to shirk personal responsibilities.</span>
</li><li> In an episode of the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em>, Chika really <em>is</em> sick, and is being cared for by her big sister. Miu pretends to be sick, as well, to gain attention. (Though by the end of the episode, Miu actually gets sick, probably due to prolonged exposure to an airborne illness, and is taken to the doctor.)
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> has Nate pretending to be sick so he can stay home to play video games. He gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> to help pretend he has a fever. Duchoo gives Nate an in-depth explanation on how to fake being sick. It fails when Nate is unable to heat the thermometer as his mother is watching. Another yokai named Coughkoff comes around and helps Nate fake a cough, which works. However it works a bit too much and he ends up with a fever. Nate ends up too sick to play video games.

</li><li> Parodied when Dilbert calls in sick and pretends to have a cough. He then admits that he doesn't have a cold, but he <em>does</em> have a headache, and he doesn't know how to make a headache sound over the phone.
</li><li> Inverted in another strip, where the Alice (who still looks rather sick) comes to work after taking a sick day, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">PHB</a> tells her he was suspicious of her taking it on a Monday.

Unfortunately for him, his mother seemingly had anticipated this, and already had the car warmed up and ready so he wouldn't be late for school.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em>, Jason attempts to fake being <em>well</em> in order to go to school and at the very least take a math test despite clearly being sick.

Nurses are also not legally allowed to go on strike, but after Carol rearranged their work schedule which resulted in them working more hours for less money (she was trying to avoid having to fire two of them, which was what the hospital wanted to do), they staged a sick-out, leaving Carol the only nurse on duty.
</li></ul></li><li> Another show that combined this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a> was the BBC drama <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dangerfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dangerfield">Dangerfield</a>. An elderly thief knows that the police have to interview her within 24 hours before they can charge her. So to avoid being questioned, she first complains of a bad back, gets examined and given some painkillers. A few hours later she then complains of having a sore throat, and it examined again, and is recommended to take some throat lozenges, however since they cant be prescribed on the NHS, a police officer has to go out and buy them for her. Later she then complains about feeling dizzy. By this point everyone knows thats shes having them on, but she gets examined again, and is told to rest. When the police do eventually get into a interview room, she then starts to show symptoms of having a heart attack. This time its genuine, however the 24 hours are up, and since they cant question her anymore, and therefore have no legal responsibility or duty of care towards her, the annoyed police officers tell she has to make her own way to the hospital.

This was done as a gambit to get the local doctor to quarantine the Hazzard court house (with both of Hazzard's police officers inside) so his friends could rob the bank.

Rather than send him off to school anyway, she cheerfully proceeds to make Matt miserable by feeding him borscht and sweating out his "fever" by swaddling him in a wool blanket with the heater on. Ironically, this and Matt's further attempts to fake sick did end up making him genuinely sick by the end of the episode.

</li><li> The flashback portion of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> had Henry catching a young Shawn pretending to be sick so that he wouldn't have to have dinner with their neighbors.

<ul><li> This comes back to bite him, in a later episode Jerry mentions he crashed his car and killed himself while adjusting the hair piece in the rear view mirror.
</li><li> In an inversion of this trope, George spends the week on vacation, but keeps his car in the parking lot. After Kramer and Jerry have to clean it from bird droppings, they crash it on the way back, but still park it back in the same space. George has to come back pretending to be seriously injured after the crash to keep from being fired.

Cromwell <em>was</em> ill and says so, having ended the previous episode with a delirious fever so bad that Henry went so far as to actually visit him (albeit in cut scenes, but in the book he's noted to have a dread of contagion).

After murdering a woman at the park, Jin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> father forces him to stick a heating pad up his shirt so that when they're pulled over for a random search due to the large number of murders in the area at the time, he can get out of it quickly by claiming that his son has a bad fever.

Pete is very strict about what counts as "sick enough" to stay home, so Max makes PJ look <em>very</em> sick, which results in him being taken to the hospital and Pete <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">very briefly</a></em> realizing that he's a bad parent.

This wouldn't be so bad by itself, especially considering Pete is his own boss, but he tells <em>PJ</em> he's sick and dying and that PJ has to take over his job. He goes so far to make him feel guilty by saying that Peg, Pistol, and Chainsaw will be stuck doing terrible jobs if he doesn't succeed. This starts to backfire when Max and Goofy give PJ the idea to use Pete in some stunts (since he's dying anyway), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">backfires even further when PJ tearfully presents the proceeds to Peg and tells her what Pete said.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies">Silly Symphony</a> "The Wise Little Hen" is a straightforward telling of The Little Red Hen, whose attempts at getting help growing her corn are met with feigned sickness by a pig and his cohort, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>, in his debut.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> Bart does this a few times, in one case pretending to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes">Tourette's Syndrome</a> (later changed to rabies via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>) and various other symptoms while Grandpa warns him against playing the "boy who cried wolf". Eventually he's attacked by an actual wolf that's escaped from Krusty's show and isn't believed.
<ul><li> In another episode, Bart eats a jagged O from a box of Krusty-Os and develops agonizing stomach pains. No one believes him except Lisa (although it's also likely that the Teachers not believing him was also simply due to callousness on their part rather than previous faking sick attempts, as Krabappel once mentioned that she also won't be held accountable if one of her students [Milhouse in this case] was eaten by the pet snake), though he is eventually taken to the hospital.
</li><li> Ms. Hoover also was speculated to have faked sick by some of the students when she revealed that her Lyme Disease was actually Psychosomatic in one episode, to which she confirms it both faking sick and being crazy.
</li><li> Even Lisa got in on the act to get out of a bad birthday party when a lot of the kids get sick from eating raw oysters (which Lisa, being a vegetarian, would have never eaten in the first place).
</li></ul></li><li> Jokey Smurf does it at least twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>: once in "Jokey's Funny Bone" in order to get attention, and another time in "Calling Doctor Smurf" in order to make Dabbler feel useful as a doctor. Although in the latter case, Jokey actually became sick when it turned out that he was allergic to the pink paint he used to make himself and several other Smurfs look like they came down with a sickness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>: In "Lord of the Rink", Prince Hugo pretended to be sick in front of his friends to get out of hockey practice after Sofia reminded him that the hockey team meets at the same time as their ice-dancing class. Later, Hugo told his friends to tell his father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is the new assistant hockey coach</span>, that his son is sick and has to miss practice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hugo was never shown fooling his father that way.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Stan and Kyle give one another ludicrously overblown maladies (date rape psychosis and cancer, respectively) in <em>Towelie,</em> telling their mothers that they're too busy nursing one another to bother with baseball practice or school.
</li><li> Done the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a></em> episode, Terminal, where Space Ghost pretends he's about to die. In classic Space Ghost style, everyone can already tell from the beginning. Space Ghost himself is shown in his thoughts to genuinely believe he's somehow dying, though, even though he refuses to specify how and gets incredibly nervous once a doctor shows up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He actually does die at the end... sorta.</span>
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake">Strawberry Shortcake</a></em>, Strawberry finds a fairy with a hurt wing and offers to take care of her until her wing heals. The fairy takes advantage of Strawberry's hospitality and all the attention her friends dote on her, pretending she can't fly even after her wing has healed.
<ul><li> Ginger Snap does it in "Ginger Snap's No Light Night of Fright" to try to get out of going on a camp-out because she's scared of the dark, but it doesn't work.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> did a variation in which Jerry painted spots on Tom to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InducedHypochondria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InducedHypochondria">make him believe he had measles</a>. Tom eventually finds out and goes after Jerry, only to find that now Jerry had the measles for real. Prior to all of this, Tom was pretending to be sick to keep Mammy Two-Shoes from sending him outside in the rain.

<ul><li> We've all done this at least once because we didn't feel like going to school or work. Don't lie.
</li><li> China's Wei General Sima Yi pulled this trick (along with his sons, too) so that he could plot a coup in secret without anyone being suspicious. This is also written in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>.
<ul><li> Cao Cao did this as well. Not to say, they both faked to have some kind of neurological disorder <em>in front of people</em>; Sima pretended to have what we call Alzheimer's now, and Cao pretended he had stroke— when he was a teenager.
</li><li> Lu Meng also used a fake illness to put Guan Yu off his guard.
</li></ul></li><li> In ancient Rome, an epileptic fit was one of the omens considered dire enough to put an end to any public assembly where a fit was seen. The sufficiently cynical would see this as a useful political ploy.
</li><li> In her childhood, actress Toni Collette once faked a burst appendix so she could miss school. Her acting was so convincing that she ended up having it removed.
</li><li> There's a modern trick called the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/26/faking-illness-online-munchausen">Munchausen by Internet syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where people lie about their own health, pretending to be seriously/deathly ill to garner sympathy. A list of some infamous cases are <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120121042216/http://wiki.fandomwank.com/index.php/Pseuicide">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Trying the light bulb thing is an easy way to generate a real-life subversion; choose the light unwisely and the mercury in the thermometer can expand so forcefully it breaks the thermometer.
</li><li> A prisoner in a British jail once attempted to fake jaundice so as to get a transfer to a prison hospital. He chose to industriously apply neon-yellow highlighter pens to his entire body to fake the classic skin discolouration. Medical staff were not deceived as his skin went such a vivid yellow colour that anyone with <em>that</em> degree of jaundice would be dead on the spot. But they gave full marks for creative imagination.
</li><li> The killdeer is a cute little bird that <em>weaponizes</em> this trope. Should a predator approach the mother bird's nest while she's still sitting on it, she will run off, dragging her wing along the ground and calling out in distress. She will keep this up, allowing the predator to chase her until eventually she has lured the predator far enough from the nest that she doesn't have to worry anymore. At that point, she drops the bluff and flies back to the nest.
