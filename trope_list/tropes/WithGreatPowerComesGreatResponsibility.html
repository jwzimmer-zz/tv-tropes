<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Trope Namer </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, of course, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, who initially took advantage of his bestowed powers purely for profit, competing as a wrestler. However, by failing to catch the criminal who would eventually kill his Uncle Ben, he takes up crime fighting, learning that his inhuman powers have a price. The only concession he makes is to take pictures of himself in action to pay the bills.
<ul><li> The phrase people most often think of, "With great power comes great responsibility" (heard in, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">the 2002 film</a>), is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a>: The <em>original</em> quote came from a narration box in the final panel of "Spider-Man!" in <em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em>, with the narrator telling the viewer how Peter has learned that "with great power there must also come — great responsibility!" The first time this was contracted this way and attributed in-page to Uncle Ben was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics">Christopher Priest (comics)</a>' <em>Spider-Man vs. Wolverine #1</em>.
</li><li> The multiple phrasing is discussed during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>. During one story, a very angry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a> confronts an Uncle Ben who gave up being a Spider because his world's Green Goblin killed his May and Peter. May, already angry that her brother was in the hands of the Inheritors, snaps at Ben for abandoning his role as a hero. She starts to use the motto before Ben corrects her with the real phrasing and uses it as the reason why he quit. Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>, Ben reminds everyone that the actual quote is 'With great power there <strong>must also</strong> come great responsibility', implying that responsibility is at once a <em>choice</em>, and an inherent part of the package with great power.
</li><li> It is also the aesop of the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, an expanded version of the classic origin story. Ben explained the concept to Peter, and cited the phrase, which was actually coined by Richard Parker, Peter's late dad. Peter was very angry at the time, and run away from him. He eventually realized that he was right, and returned home to apologize himself and reveal his new powers. The thief scene played out in a similar way, but added a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGotToSayGoodbye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGotToSayGoodbye">Never Got to Say Goodbye</a> to the mix.
</li><li> That phrase, Spider-Man's trademark, is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em> in a conversation with Spider-Man:
<div class="indent">"With great power comes—" <br/>"Don't you <em>dare</em> finish that line, or you'll have so much webbing in your hair you'd have to shave yourself bald."
</div></li><li> Played straight with the actual character in-game, however, where he has the passive "Great Responsibility," which gives him a chance to protect an ally from an enemy attack. If he does, it switches to "Great Power," which increases his damage. Once he attacks, it changes back to "Great Responsibility."
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> story depicts Spider-Man stopping the burglar for self serving reasons—he know he'll get good publicity off of it. As a result, Peter Parker becomes a pampered movie star and millionaire with beautiful women jumping into his bed on a nightly basis. He doesn't learn the "with great power..." lesson until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> sacrifices his own life to protect him.
</li><li> Ezekiel, a person with powers similar to Peter, poses a question to Spider-Man.
<div class="indent">"And what comes with great responsibility?" <br/>"What?" <br/>"If great power comes with great responsibility, what comes with great responsibility? Power? Freedom? Guilt?" <br/>(Peter points a finger at the City's view) "You want to know what comes with great responsibility? This all."
</div></li><li> In an issue of Universe X, an older, fatter Parker answers this when he declares that he had the maxim backwards all along:
<div class="indent"> "It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">responsibility that brings power</a>. It's knowing what needs to be done that brings strength. And courage. That's my daughter... and I won't let her remain a mindless slave of the Skull."
</div></li><li> In the evilest ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></em>, Peter has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">fallen</a> so far that he rejects his former motto, claiming that he never knew what power was and he <em>likes</em> it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Black Suit!Spider-Man</strong>: I was told that with great power comes great responsibility. <br/><strong>Symbiote!Black Cat</strong>: And now? <br/><strong>Black Suit!Spider-Man</strong>: I never knew what power <em>was</em>!
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManEdgeOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManEdgeOfTime">Spider-Man: Edge of Time</a></em> the Alchemax CEO, an evil 2099 version of Peter Parker, has his own twisted version after falling to despair over losing everything he loved.
<div class="indent"> "With great power comes great responsibility, and great opportunity. And the only way to live up to all that responsibility, is to use every opportunity to get all the power."
</div></li><li> This is the underlying moral of the 50th Anniversary storyline, "Alpha": a ordinary teenager is given incredible powers by an accident caused by a disgruntled worker. Peter, as himself and Spidey, attempts to reel him in, but his ego gets the better of him, turning him into a celebrity who'd willingly cheat on the girl he was crushing on and deciding to emancipate himself from his parents after the Jackal kidnaps them in a plot, not to save them, but because they were cramping his style. Spidey pulls the plug on Alpha's fun once and for all after a fight with Terminus nearly causes hundreds of deaths when his powers short circuit airplanes all over New York, two of those near-victims being Aunt May and her husband, Jay Jameson (JJJ's dad).
</li><li> It's also the underlying moral of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> storyline: Doc Ock takes over Peter's body before his gives out and decides he can be a better Spidey than Peter ever was. While he creates his own company, gets his degree and creates an army to protect New York City with, it ends up alienating him from virtually everyone because of his massive ego. When the Goblin King brings everything down around his ears, Otto's forced to accept that Peter was the better Spidey because he allowed himself to have those chances to be better slip away because he felt he didn't deserve them.
<ul><li> This is turned on its head in Nick Spencer's first issue of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards everything after that - Peter is exposed as a plagiarist when it's revealed that a paper Otto wrote to get his diploma in Empire State University was similar to what Otto actually wrote (in <em>Superior</em>, a man caught note of what "Peter" had done, but Otto stops him by using one of his old devices to pretend Otto had convinced him to accept it). After he's fired from the <em>Daily Bugle</em>, laughed at by Mary Jane and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">brushed off by Aunt May</a>, Peter comes to realize that he screwed up big time - he should have dumped everything Otto had built up (he even admits the paper Otto wrote was on a subject <em>he knew about just as well</em>) and by taking in everything Otto built, he wasn't taking responsibility for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Then it's subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">Secret Wars (2015)</a></em> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows">Renew Your Vows</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Peter gives up being Spider-Man to protect MJ and their daughter Annie, making him the last superhero alive in a world ruled by the mysterious Regent.

That's <strong>inane</strong>. Most people in life don't <strong>have</strong> great power, and the few that do are almost never responsible with it.

Spidey attempts to psyche up Franklin Richards, who is afraid his power isn't enough to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the storyline, using his motto, but the Thing, annoyed Spidey's going this route, grabs him by the back of his shirt, lifts him aside, and psyches up his godchild his own way.
</li><li> Deconstructed in the storyline <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hunted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hunted">Hunted</a></em> as Curt Conners tells him that while Spidey does understand the idea of that, he doesn't understand it from the eyes of a parent, which is why he's willing to let loose the Lizard to save his son.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderManNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderManNoir">Spider-Man: Noir</a></em> has its own turn on the concept with a lesson Peter learned from his Uncle Ben, who was a pilot in WWI:
<div class="indent"><em>If those in <strong>power</strong> cannot be trusted, it is the <strong>responsibility</strong> of the people to remove them.</em>
</div></li><li> Nick Spencers run deconstructed this, pointing out that for all his talk, Spideys never really been responsible at all.
</li><li> Naturally this comes up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManPS4">Spider-Man (PS4)</a></em>, but with a cruel subversion at the end of the game; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's a mentally corrupted and freshly-defeated Otto Octavius, having gone mad with vengeance and infected Manhattan with a deadly bioweapon, declaring that he and Peter Parker have a responsibility to do what's best for people in an attempt to get Peter to help him. At first Otto seems to be describing this very trope, but he perverts the very concept right after by proclaiming it's to do it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSupremacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSupremacist">"those beneath us, whether they understand it or not."</a> Peter, already beside himself in grief over his father-figure and mentor in this continuity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">becoming such a twisted man</a>, immediately flips his lid.</span>
</li><li> Aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">first film</a> having the words said as in the comic book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> has Otto Octavius telling Peter that "Intelligence is not a privilege; it's a gift. And you use it for the good of mankind." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the climax, Peter echoes these words to him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHimByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHimByTalking">Break Him By Talking</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Somewhat deconstructed:
<div class="indent"><strong>Uncle Ben:</strong> You're a lot like your father. You really are, Peter, and that's a good thing. But your father lived by a philosophy, a principle really. He believed that... that if you could do good things for other people, you had a moral obligation to do those things. That's what at stake here. Not a choice, responsibility. <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> That is nice. That's really... that's great. That's all well and good, so where is he? <br/><strong>Uncle Ben:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> Where is he? Where's my dad? He didn't think it was his responsibility to be here and tell me this himself? <br/><strong>Uncle Ben:</strong> Oh, come on! How dare you? <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> How dare <em>I</em>? How dare <em>you</em>?!
</div></li><li> This theme is explored in the parallel between Spidey and the Lizard. Both believe in this, but they disagree on what their responsibility is. Peter believes that his responsibility is to help other people and to take care of Aunt May. Connors believes that his responsibility is to give everyone else his powers.
</li><li> More explored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro">Max</a> uses all of his power as Electro to try to make everyone else feel as powerless as he once felt before getting his powers. Harry Osborn also refuses to accept any responsibility for his actions or for his condition. In reality, there <em>is</em> no one to blame for Harry's disease, but Harry blames Spider-Man and Menken for his crappy life, especially after he becomes the Goblin. Specifically, Menken had in fact framed Harry for Electro's creation so he can take over Oscorp, which still isn't a good way to handle responsibility of running a company, but Spider-Man's case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his apparent refusal to help him</span> was only using his own responsibility to protect his friends and family, including Harry.

<div class="indent">"When you can do the things that I can, but you don't... and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you."
</div></li><li> This is a main theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>: after Peter nearly gets an entire ferry filled with people killed, Tony Stark reads him the riot act and demands his suit back. When Peter claims that he's nothing without the suit, Tony tells him that if he needs the suit to be a hero and a better person, then he shouldn't have it to begin with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em> revisits the idea as Peter finds himself being thrust into the spotlight as Tony Stark's successor. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Feeling that the responsibility is too great for him to wield the power of EDITH, Tony's posthumous gift to him, Peter relinquishes it to Quinton Beck. Unfortunately, Beck proceeds to use that power to endanger the lives of everyone in London (including his classmates), forcing Peter to take responsibility for Beck misusing such power.</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> Thank you, Spectre. You have taught me a great lesson here  and I won't forget it! Fate has granted us great power  But power for power's sake is utterly worthless! Power is meaningless... until it is tempered with conscience!
</div></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSuperman">All-Star Superman</a></em>, although not spelled out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> gains Superman's powers at the end and goes on a rampage, stopping every so often as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> give him new insights on the universe. Just as his powers run out, he declares that life is beautiful and everyone needs to stick together - implying that anybody with Superman's godlike perspective would naturally choose to become an altruist. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

If anything it's a combination of Superman's godlike perspective and being raised well that makes Clark Kent who he is.</span>
</li><li> Superman isn't above using his powers to get a good news story if doing so doesn't interfere with fighting evil. In one of the earliest comics he scooped Lois on a story about a dam bursting by outrunning her train, stopping the flood, and phoning the story in. Sort of justified in that his heroing makes his job more difficult far more often than it makes it easier  like Peter Parker, the guy deserves a break.
</li></ul></li><li> Occasionally averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> when a mutant is shown using their powers to aid in doing their day job. For example, Colossus used his superhuman strength and endurance to work as a farmer (in the comics) and a construction worker (on the TV series) before joining the team. While he is using his powers to do productive work for society, it is clear that he <em>is</em> getting paid for it.
<ul><li> This was (and still is) a common trait of Communist superheroes (and supervillains!) in comics. Most if not all of them are on the government payroll. It's superhumans from non-autocratic countries who have the <em>freedom</em> to use their powers as they choose.
</li><li> This was also demonstrated in the 1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker">Sleepwalker</a></em> comics with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> Spectra. Her initial criminal schemes give her amazing superhuman powers and transform her into a supervillain, and she seems ready to become a criminal, but by the next time Sleepwalker runs into her she's using her light-projecting abilities to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">make a living working for a glassware manufacturer</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Various versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> usually wrestle with this - Tony Stark's fortune is built on his engineering genius, but in the film, Tony decides to get his company out of the munitions business after seeing that his weapons were being sold in dirty deals to terrorists and criminals. In the comics, Stark quit selling weapons years ago, but he still frets about villains stealing and abusing his armor designs, sometimes to the level of paranoia that he manipulates, deceives and attacks his own friends.
</li><li> A bit of a subversion and Aesop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Rita Farr's</a> inability to control her size-changing abilities ended her film career. The only movie she made after it was a knockoff of "The Incredible Shrinking Woman." Likewise, her adopted son (Gar "Beast Boy" Logan) also went into acting, and had a good run on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> knockoff, using his shapechanging ability to play an alien...however, neither of them were able to find more acting work, since their reputations as "freaks" made them un-castable in anything else. Other DCU examples were Victor "Cyborg" Stone and Cliff "Robot Man" Steele. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Emergency Transformations</a> enhanced them, but also rendered them ineligible to participate in the athletic abilities they loved because their cybernetics were considered cheating. For all of the above, it's arguable that they're in the hero business because they <em>can't</em> do anything else.

She is reluctant to use it for her personal gain from an ethical standpoint, but in a more practical sense, she knows that abusing this ability might make it go away, since it's tied to her character and reputation.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode "Cool Hand Peter", Peter, Joe, Quagmire, and (a visiting) Cleveland decide to take a roadtrip down south to get away from their wives for a bit.

When it looks like their stay in prison may be indefinite, the gang opts to escape on their own, back to Quahog. When they arrive, it turns out the police force followed them, only for Joe to reveal that he anticipated this and called in Quahog's police force.

One possible future that he created by cheating on an ersatz SAT led to his friends and family being killed in an extremely unlikely accident... because his English teacher wanted to make a point. Danny himself being the sole survivor, he wound up having his ghost half turned into a monster who killed his human half and began a ten year reign of terror. Half-averted with Vlad Masters/Vlad Plasmius who used his powers to amass a fortune through clearly unethical means... and half-played staight in that he's a lonely and bitter man who wants to be loved. Well, that's what he says as he tries to repeatedly kill Jack Fenton and endangers innocent people on a regular basis. You would think Vlad alone would be enough of an example to not need the other Aesops, but Danny can be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> on occasion.

A few minutes after doing so, their powers are stripped away by a side-effect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Stone of Threbe's</a> presence, and they spend the rest of the episode wishing they'd used their powers more responsibly. The loss of the girls' powers isn't directly related to their misuse, but it seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">Karma chose to bite them in the butt</a>.

Karma does pay them back at the end when Blunk <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> rolls into a car wash and gets clean</span>.

<ul><li> Also in "H is for Hunted" they transform to decorate their gym for the farewell party of one of their teachers and mostly get away with it, though they do come close to getting caught. The more realistic Aesop ("Don't neglect your responsibilities") is mixed in with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> fairly well and the Astral Drops are not used at all for the rest of the season, though more likely because of Nerissa's ability instead of the girls actually learning their lesson.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire">Voltaire</a> actually came up with the quote, making him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> in spite of the iconic usage of the quote in <em>Spider-Man</em> being far more well-known. This mantra is often used on forums to explain how its leaders should act.
</li><li> The doctrine of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige">noblesse oblige<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> teaches that the wealthy and powerful are expected to hold themselves to a higher standard and contribute more to society than those in less powerful or less fortunate positions.
</li><li> The philosophy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Objectivism">Objectivism</a> devised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> specifically defies this trope. Objectivism defines the pursuit of one's own material self-interest (without ever resorting to "force, fraud, or coercion") as morally good, and defines things which prevent people from doing so (such as the "oppressive" idea that you should act to save the lives of others when you do not want to do that) as evil. To an Objectivist, one's degree of power does not alter this fundamental moral principle: with power, comes no responsibility to do anything but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">advance your own material greed</a> without resorting to "force, fraud, or coercion": <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">"I swear ... that I will never live for the sake of another man, *nor ask another man to live for mine*"</a> establishes that <em>everyone</em> has the same and no greater responsibility than to seek their own self-interest without violating the rights of others.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EconomicTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EconomicTheories">political-economic doctrine</a> of Social Darwinism also defies this trope, saying that when everyone acts selfishly and government does not force the powerful to help the weak (through taxing them to provide public education, road works, healthcare etc) and allows the powerful to prey upon the weak (through charging them rents for housing, utilities, transport, etc), the 'Invisible Hand' of 'The Free Market' perfectly ensures that the objectively 'valuable' and hardworking people in society become powerful/rich and the 'worthless' and lazy become weak/poor. In other words, Social Darwinism claims that when 'government gets out of the market' then the world operates according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a> is evil in the eyes of Social Darwinism because there is no such thing as "the undeserving poor": the 'Invisible Hand' perfectly allocates wealth, so poor people are poor because they are morally bankrupt and/or objectively worthless to the economy. Preventing the so-called "needy" from dying only hurts the economy and society as a whole.
</li><li> US Christianity has the so-called "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology">Prosperity Theology<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> movement which maintains that health and wealth are perfectly allocated to people in accordance with God's will. Consequently, Prosperity Theology defies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a> because helping the sick or poor literally goes against God's will. Other schools of US Christian theology, and most foreign ones, regard this message as inimical to the core values of Christianity (which they believe plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a> straight) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">and we're going to leave it at that.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> was credited with the saying "The price of greatness is responsibility", which is close enough to the Spider-Man line to make one wonder if Stan Lee might not have come across that quote when creating Spider-Man.
</li><li> Soldiers, police officers, judges, and others in similar positions are often required to swear oaths to never abuse their powers. This does not prevent said powers from being abused either with or without official sanction. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">We don't need specific examples.</a>
</li><li> Any weapons or combat sport class will drill into their students' heads that they have an obligation to use their skills and tools in a safe and responsible manner. As noted in the <em>Literature</em> folder above, martial artists are trained from Day 1 to only use their powers in self-defense and defense of others, and the Eastern martial arts especially place great value on discipline and honorable actions. As with the example above, however, that's not to say that there aren't unfortunate instances of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a> in real life.
</li><li> The opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Kimble v. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Entertainment, LLC</a></em>, 576 U.S. ___ (2015), invalidating a licensing agreement related to a Spider-Man toy since the underlying patent expired, quoted the line word for word in its conclusion:
<div class="indent">What we can decide, we can undecide. But <em>stare decisis</em> teaches that we should exercise that authority sparingly. Cf. S. Lee and S. Ditko, Amazing Fantasy No. 15: "Spider-Man," p. 13 (1962) ("[I]n this world, with great power there must also come—great responsibility").
</div></li><li> Parenting is a mundane but common expression of this. You made (or adopted) a kid - that's great! You have a HUGE degree of power over this younger, smaller person. However, with all that power comes a responsibility to make sure their physical and psychological needs are met and that they develop into an independent, capable, socially functional and morally upstanding person capable of taking care of themselves and being considerate of others over the course of the next (at least) twenty years: In effect, you have <em>the responsibility to develop your child into the best person you can make him be</em>.
</li><li> Adulthood itself is another mundane example. Yes you have the freedom to do a lot of things you can't do as a kid, but for the vast majority of people you need to hold down a job to pay to do these fun things. Or even for the basic things like electricity, food, or to keep a roof over your head - a large part of adults spend their time working just to pay for things taken for granted. You can gorge yourself on junk food as much as you want, but you have to be aware of the risks to health by repeatedly doing so. Failing to meet one's responsibilities can lead to serious financial, legal, or health issues.
</li><li> Used as a quote in an official U.S. Department of Justice press release by Manny Muriel, the Special Agent in Charge of the IRS' Criminal Division, when announcing the 5.5-year prison sentence of former Detroit-area trash hauling CEO Charles B. Rizzo on conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud charges.
<div class="indent">With power comes great responsibility. When you willingly choose to use your power to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars and commit bribery, know that IRS-CI will be there to hold you accountable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">IRS - CI Special Agents will comb through any rubbish to find evidence of a crime</a> - in this case, shell companies and phony legal settlement agreements, especially one as egregious and offensive as this.
