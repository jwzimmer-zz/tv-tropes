</p><p>Games, of various types, are about rules. They may have intricate backstories, multi-layered plots and other such. But in the end, they're about rules. Rules define what are legal moves and what aren't (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball">Calvinball</a>, which just doesn't have the <em>same</em> rules all the time). Rules create fun.
</p><p>Sometimes, rules can interact in ways that developers didn't intend, allowing players to play the game in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">ways the designers did not intend</a>. This is called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay">Emergent Gameplay</a>" and is typically considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">a good thing</a>. But at other times, it leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayDerailment">Gameplay Derailment</a> in the <em>bad</em> sense.
</p><p>The obvious answer is to change the original rules, but this isn't always possible. Say your game is two weeks from shipping. One of your testers has just come to you with a horrifically game-breaking scenario, a way for a player to game the rules so that their powers spiral out of control and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> everything in their path. And the rule interaction is very complicated; you can't just tweak a few things to bring this back into balance. In order to truly fix the problem, you would need to rebuild a number of rules, test those rules and so forth... and miss your ship deadline. What do you do?

Thousands, maybe millions of people are playing and enjoying it. Then some Power Gamer figures out how to game the system and auto-win with some horrific combination of moves. You certainly can't "uncreate" the game once it's out there, nor can you radically modify the rules so that particular combo doesn't work, because that would fundamentally change the game and honk off millions of customers. What do you do?
</p><p>Make an Obvious Rule Patch. That is, create a completely arbitrary rule that forcibly prevents the particular interaction from happening, while having as little effect on other rules as possible. Doesn't matter if it sticks out like a sore thumb even to someone who hasn't played the previous version.
</p><p>Note that issuing an Obvious Rule Patch for a competitive multiplayer game too soon can damage the evolving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a>, which can often bring potential Game Breakers back into balance. And just so we're clear, "Obvious Rule Patch" refers to the rule that obviously exists solely to patch up something rather than the something that "obviously" needs a rule patch. "Rule" here is a simple adjective - the Patch is the focus, and the Obviousness is what makes it this trope. For the obviously needed patches, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw">There Should Be a Law</a>. Sort of.

<ul><li> Almost as soon as pinball was invented, players shook, jostled, and even lifted the machines to score more points. Hence, the now-famous tilt mechanism was invented to penalize players who were too rough on the machines. Pinball machines nowadays weigh up to a quarter of a ton, so a grade above that, a "slam" or "slam tilt," was created later to more severely punish a player who plays so vigorously that it could harm the machine or bystanders (including the player). On most machines, a slam tilt is triggered by hitting the front of the machine or coin box area too hard, or lifting the machine off the ground (on purpose or otherwise).
</li><li> The <em>bang back</em> is a technique to prevent outlane drains by holding one flipper up and banging on the underside of the machine. Doing it right causes the ball to pass back up through the gap created by the raised flippers, allowing the player to continue the game. On older machines a mild push would do this, but modern machines are much heavier, which could lead players to perform full blown body-checks on the machines, possibly lifting them right off the floor or crashing the backbox into the wall behind the machine in the process (see "slam tilt" above). Manufacturers responded by installing metal brackets under the flippers, but this only encouraged people to thump <em>harder</em> in the hope the ball would jump the brackets. Some operators went further and installed nails at the bottom of the machine to give anyone who tried this a nasty and bloody surprise, although safety regulations now prevent this. This technique is one of the few that will immediately disqualify a player in all major tournaments (the other one being a "death save", which is a very similar but slightly different move). Oddly, pinball <em>simulators</em> often actively support and encourage bang backs, presumably because there is no per-game cost and no risk of injury or damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanStern">Pirates of the Caribbean (Stern)</a></em>, the pirate ship and Kraken on the playfield are surrounded by two large transparent plastic shields (dubbed "sneeze guards" by some players) to prevent airborne pinballs from landing in the mechanisms.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/KissStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/KissStern">KISS (Stern)</a></em>, the ball rolling out of Gene Simmons's head is designed to drop out in a random direction, with some horizontal spin. There were so many complaints when the game first came out about the ball taking an unpredictably curved path into a drain that the game was patched to return the ball to the plunger with no consequences if the ball drains in the next three seconds after coming out of Gene's mouth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAvengersStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAvengersStern">The Avengers (Stern)</a></em>, the Black Widow ramp makes a steep incline, then a sharp 90-degree turn to the left at the start. Getting the pinball through this turn was soon discovered to be an amazingly difficult task, as the ball was far more likely to bounce back down instead of making the turn. In 2016, Stern distributed a patch that made it such that simply triggering the switch at the beginning of the ramp counts as making the full ramp.
</li><li> People playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarTrekStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarTrekStern">Star Trek (Stern)</a></em> were letting the timer run out in the timed modes, due to how the game counts a timed mode as being complete when time runs out, even if the player does absolutely nothing the entire time. A patch in 2014 made two changes to discourage stopping and waiting: First, the timer would freeze if there has been no attempt to score for five seconds, then unfreeze when the ball gets moving again; and secondly, the game now has a medal system, where bronze, silver, and gold medals are given out with the player's third, sixth, and ninth successful shot for each mode, with a large point award given out for each medal after the ball drains. Additionally, any medals earned will have significant scoring implications for the game's wizard modes, encouraging players to actually attempt to play the modes out to reap their dividends later.
</li><li> The original code of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em> allowed ghosts to be collected during Mass Hysteria multiball, which is awarded at 100 ghosts. Also, some machines shipped with a defect that made accumulating ghosts relatively easy. Mass Hysteria could then be restarted <em>within itself</em>, as well as Loopin' Supers and PKE Frenzy, which are huge scoring modes themselves. This lead to having minutes' worth of multiball ballsavers, and scores that could easily exceed 10 billion. The very next patch simply decided to stop allowing ghost progression during Mass Hysteria.
</li><li> Tournaments sanctioned by PAPA (Professional &amp; Amateur Pinball Association) have point values given to the top finishers, with the people with the most given invitations to the World Championships. Initially, each event provided a fixed point value for the winner, the runner-up, and so forth, with anyone getting sanctioning as long as they had machines to play them on and the organizers filled out the paperwork. But there were some places, most notably in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland">Portland</a>, Oregon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington, where pinball can be found in multitudes of public locations, some of which hold weekly and even semi-weekly tournaments, all of them PAPA-sanctioned. This meant someone could enter dozens upon dozens of tournaments through the year and get an invitation even though they might only be the best players at the local level. Through 2014 and 2015, there was a big overhaul of the PAPA points system, one of which was that points would be given out directly proportionally to the number of players in the tournament. This meant someone could be the best in their neighborhood, but they had to seek out a major event, like Pinburgh or MAGfest, where the world's greatest players would be, and go toe-to-toe with them to get the big points.
</li><li> All machines made in the past 50 years have the "three-switch rule": If your ball drains before hitting the third switch, the machine will spit out another ball and pretend the previous one didn't happen. Over time, some players have discovered that these first two switches can be used to progress towards modes, point awards, and multiballs on certain machines, and by letting the ball drain, they can keep doing this until they get what they want. In response, manufacturers, starting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, have released software patches that add exceptions to the three-switch rule if it can be exploited to play risk-free like that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StarWarsStern">Star Wars (Stern)</a></em>, the end-of-ball bonus includes all modes that the player has completed — but it also counts modes that the player automatically gets credit for at the start of the game (which differ by character). This caused end-of-ball bonuses to be disproportionately huge, especially if the player had a poor ball otherwise. It wasn't uncommon for a poor (~10 million) point ball to be rewarded with a bonus of nearly 100 million. A later update stopped counting these "freebie" modes, making bonuses more reasonable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb">Hadron Enforcer</a> originally was able to collect various important jackpots (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode">Wizard Mode</a>s Super Jackpot, or the hurry-up that both starts Orb Multiball and determines how much every subsequent jackpot is worth). Version 0.95 removed both of these.
</li><li> Early versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>' code required the player to finish battles against the Demogorgon by shooting the ball into the corresponding toy's mouth. After it became clear that this was far more difficult than intended, it was changed so that the Demogorgon had a health bar that decreased if the ball hit any part of it, with the mouth shot becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> method of doing so that was quicker and more valuable.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>
<ul><li> Limits on how many Roadblocks a racer could perform were instituted after Season 5, after the three women who made the Final 3 that year performed a total of three Roadblocks combined.
</li><li> In Season 1, teams were only allowed to buy one set of plane tickets, and weren't allowed to switch, even if they found a faster flight or their original flight was delayed. This was changed on the very next season, and multiple flight bookings has become an important part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> ever since.
</li><li> The first two seasons had no rules in place for when a team's car broke down. These were instigated in Season 3 after several time credits were issued in Season 2 (including one that saved Blake and Paige from an elimination, which they received after Paige threatened to sue).
</li><li> After Season 3, it became standard on selling tasks, where teams had to reach a certain amount of money made, for each individual item to have a minimum amount it could be sold for. This was after Ken &amp; Gerard completed such a task by selling massive amounts of fruit for what would average out to be very low prices, and repeatedly going back to the stall to get more to sell.
</li><li> After All-Stars, where two teams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">horribly exploited the ability to take locals along on the leg with you to help with navigation and other tasks</a>, bringing locals along in your vehicle was made against the rules.
</li><li> Up through Season 15, the penalty for not completing either side of the Detour was 24 hours (which pretty much ensured elimination). But when Maria and Tiffany were physically unable to complete either end of the detour, it was shortened to 6 hours in Season 16.
</li><li> After Nat &amp; Kat on Season 17 took detailed notes throughout the race in anticipation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale">Final Exam Finale</a>, Season 19's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale">Final Exam Finale</a> instructions specifically forbade the use of notes. (There was no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamFinale">Final Exam Finale</a> in Season 18.)
</li><li> Other minor changes were made to keep teams from taking advantage of loopholes, such as buying cellphones from locals (which Rob &amp; Brennan did in Season 1) or switching their damaged car for another team's car at the Pit Stop (Dustin &amp; Kandice in Season 10).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>:
<ul><li> The hidden immunity idol mechanics were changed. First making it so that you could play it after the vote. Then, putting the limitation that you couldn't use it beyond the final six because it more or less gave Yul a free ride to the final three, since everyone was afraid to cast a vote against him for fear of the idol being played. Then, changing how the clues were hidden due to Russell's obsessive idol hunting. (Except they appeared to have forgotten it in <em>Redemption Island</em> and later; or later players were just <em>that</em> good to have found them in the first couple episodes.)
</li><li> After "Purple" Kelly and NaOnka quit in <em>Nicaragua</em>, the rules were amended so that quitters can be banned from sitting on the jury if production felt it was appropriate. And typically, you can guess that unless you're trying to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a> or are having a severe physical or mental breakdown, that'll probably be...never.
</li><li> Reducing the eligible age to 18. (Although this hasn't really affected gameplay; several contestants have been below 21 in the game since <em>China</em>.)
</li><li> Not using the "purple rock" tiebreaker (where, in the event of unresolved tie, elimination is by random chance with everyone <em>but</em> those voted for at risk and those with immunity) in the final four, because the one time it was used in <em>Marquesas</em>, Paschal was eliminated without having a single vote cast for him in the entire game.
<ul><li> Tiebreakers in general; although the spectre of drawing rocks (<em>Blood vs. Water</em> confirmed that they <em>do</em> still use it outside the final four) causing people to betray their alliances to avoid it. You'll notice that for some reason, people are <em>quite</em> afraid of forcing a tie outside of the final four that can't be solved by a simple re-vote (such as John changing his vote for Laura in <em>Samoa</em>, Russell being voted out first from his tribe in <em>Redemption Island</em>, and Cochran turning on his tribe in <em>South Pacific</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Supposedly, someone smuggled something into the game in their luxury item (or used their luxury item in a rather creative way) to have fire.
</li><li> In Season 2, <em>Australia</em>, contestants could bring a personal item. Colby brought a Texas flag that doubled as a tarp... It, along with all the other shelter items, got snatched mid-season.
<ul><li> Although this was more their food was gone and they traded it for food.
</li></ul></li><li> The Final Two became the Final Three. While not all fans like this, Probst says that this was so people would have to face a competitor and not just drag <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> into the finals. Chances are, everyone's thoughts towards Courtney in <em>Exile Island</em> (intending to bring her to the finals because everyone <em>hated</em> her) made the producers think. Probst has pointed out there have been plenty of seasons where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">everyone complained the final two was a wash anyways</a>, one of them conveniently being <em>Exile Island</em>. This didn't stop Earl from claiming the first unanimous victory against two disliked players in <em>Fiji</em> and Boston Rob from pulling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">two dumbest and laziest players</a> to the finals in <em>Redemption Island</em>, but most other seasons have had closer votes in the final three.
<ul><li> This was also done as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> complaining about "Blowout" final twos because people had on <em>many</em> different seasons said that the winner was pretty obvious, nobody would've voted for [insert second place winner here], and the final tribal council was essentially just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> because it was obvious that [insert winner here] had it. Or people just pulling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonBadass">What Measure Is a Non-Badass?</a> when the fan favorite or most likely winner finished fifth-third place and a person deemed "undeserving" won.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em>:
<ul><li> During Seasons 2 and 3, after houseguests were evicted they would be released back into the real world and were able to watch the show. In addition, every evicted houseguest would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">return for the finale</a> and cast a vote for who they wanted to win. However, this changed after season 3 and it's Final 2 of Danielle and Lisa. Danielle was well-liked, widely regarded as the better game-player of the two, and by all accounts would have won the series. The only issue was, Danielle had said horrible things about her fellow houseguests in the Diary Room, and these comments were shown on the show several times. The evicted houseguests were angry at what Danielle had said about them, and come finale night voted 9-1 for Lisa to win. Ever since, the 7 houseguests evicted before final 2 have been sequestered after their evictions and form a "jury" that votes on the winner.
<ul><li> Starting with Season 15, the jury size was changed from 7 people to 9 people, to accommodate the increasing cast sizes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Power of Veto was made into the Golden Power of Veto <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0a9du');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0a9du" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0a9du');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">you can use it on yourself to avoid being evicted</span> permanently after Season 3.
</li><li> In season 5, the houseguests realized that you had to pick the veto players yourself so you had full control over the players in the competition. So in order to get rid of Jase, the houseguests made up a plan and nominated two people who would have used the veto on themselves, or their other alliance members who'd have used the veto anyways. They then proceeded to pick players for the veto who would use the veto on their friends or were in on the plan and would use it anyways and evicted Jase without even letting him have a chance. The rule change was that Houseguests actually had to draw names out of a bag and only if they picked a "Houseguest's Choice" Token could they choose themselves.
<ul><li> This has been changed again as of Season 15. Houseguests now pick players out of a box instead of a bag, presumably after Frank was accused of intentionally dropping the bag of chips &amp; palming the "Houseguest's Choice" Token in Season 14.
</li></ul></li><li> This happened with Season 15's big twist. The idea of the twist was that each week, the public could vote for one person in the house to become the "MVP" for the week and have the special power to nominate a third person for eviction. In theory, this was a great idea that would lend itself to drama, the only problem was that one of the houseguests was the sister of a former fan favorite. After the sister was voted to have the MVP title 3 weeks in a row, and the twist was changed so that the audience was now the MVP and they would choose the third nominee.
<ul><li> This led to an amusing situation during Week 4 where the sister was nominated by the public because fans didn't realize the rules had changed, and kept voting for her.
</li><li> By the time Season 18 rolled around, the producers seemed to have learned their lesson. This season had a similar twist where each week the audience could vote to give one person an advantage. However, once one person had been given an advantage they were no longer eligible to be voted for, presumably to prevent a fan favorite from being rewarded week after week.
</li></ul></li><li> A very subtle example, but notice that the houseguests are cutting with plastic knives. This was because of a Season 2 incident where Justin held a knife to another houseguest's throat and said "Would you mind if I killed you?"
</li><li> If someone is expelled or leaves when evicted players go to the jury, their vote at the end is given to the viewers and is used as a tiebreaker.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopShot">Top Shot</a></em>, if one team has more contestants than the other team due to eliminations, the weaker team can choose who to bench from the stronger team. This inevitably leads to the stronger team's perceived best shooter being benched. There's a rule that the same shooter cannot be benched twice in a row specifically to avoid making a strong shooter sit out most of the series.
<ul><li> In one season, one team was losing so badly, they had to alter the rules to ensure the game was still equitable, because one team outnumbered the other 2:1 before the green team revamp was scheduled.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a>:
<ul><li> For the first 3 seasons of the show, Ru would pick the winner from the season's Top 2 queens. During Season 3, however, Perez Hilton learned who the winner was ahead of time and leaked it on his website, something Ru was <em>not</em> happy about. This led to the tradition of Ru selecting a winner from the Top 3 rather than the Top 2, and filming all 3 queens being crowned so that only Ru and a select few editors knew the true winner before the airing of the finale.
</li><li> Seasons 5 and 6 had Coco Montrese and Trinity K Bonet, respectively, both queens whose main strength was their lip syncing ability. Problem is, the only time a queen is required to lip sync on the show is when they're in the bottom 2. Because of this, the two struggled on the show, rarely placed high in a challenge (combined, they only had one challenge win), but ended up going far in the competition simply because nobody could beat them in a lip sync. Starting with Season 7, every season has had one challenge involving a group lip sync performance simply to give similar "lip sync assassins" a chance to prove themselves on the show.
</li><li> Starting with Season 6, immunity from the following week's elimination is no longer given out as a reward for winning a challenge. This was after several instances in Season 5 where a queen would have likely been up for elimination if they weren't immune.
</li><li> Season 9 had a <em>finale</em> patch. After several subpar lip sync performances throughout the season (Charlie standing in place, Nina giving up, Valentina and the mask), Ru announced that rather than the regular finale, where Ru picks a winner from the remaining Top 3 queens based on their performance throughout the season, there would be a Top 4 going into finale night, where the winner would be decided through a bracket-style lip sync tournament. An effective, if extreme message on the importance of lip syncing in the show.
</li><li> On <em>All Stars 3</em>, Bebe notoriously refused to reveal who she had chosen to eliminate, "out of respect" for the just-eliminated contestant. Trixie revealed on social media later that the queen who didn't win the lip sync was still required by the producers to show who they chose to eliminate. Presumably this change carried over to <em>All Stars 4</em> as well.

However, Goku manages to save himself from "loss by ringout" because he gets Flying Nimbus to save him at the last moment. This causes a problem because Giran, of course, claims this was an unfair move, and the referee is having trouble deciding whether or not this should be allowed. The referee consults with the overseers of the rules off-screen, and the referee returns and finally says...since clouds are a natural part of the environment, it wasn't illegal for Goku to use one to stop his own ring-out. <em>However</em>, Goku is forbidden to use the cloud <em>again</em> (and the implication is that this is now a new rule; no future fighters can use clouds to stop being thrown out of the ring). Giran is disappointed at not being immediately given the victory, but upon learning Goku can't use the cloud a second time, he smirks and says, "That sounds good. I can live with that."

It is stated in-universe that the complete list of fouls is kept private to prevent people from "getting ideas". <em>Quidditch Through The Ages</em> also lists patches onto Quidditch, including the introduction of a standardized scoring hoop size. This was because the hoops replaced wicker baskets, which were tricky to standardize and led to teams deliberately putting grape-sized baskets on one end and "great wicker caves" on the other, or setting the baskets on fire.

This rule has been in the charter since 1850 and noone thought to ammend it to fit with the changing nature of the sheriff's department. In 2020 most sheriff's deputies do not know how to ride a horse and the closest to a mounted posse is the mounted division which is a secondary department that uses horses to patrol the rough rural areas of the county. So the job of acting sheriff goes to Bill Hollister who is the longest serving member of the division because he is very unpopular with his superiors and has been permamently exiled there. The county government is bound by the charter so Hollister gets to serve as sheriff till the next election and the charter is then going to be changed so something like this never happens again.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> a rule given a few times is "do not boil a baby goat in its mother's milk", which otherwise doesn't violate any of the dietary rules. Apparently this was an issue, but nobody really remembers why. The most likely explanation was that it was some kind of pagan ritual, but the only direct evidence of such a practice is a single Ugaritic text that may have been mistranslated. Other suggestions include consideration for the lactose-intolerant and a simple judgment that boiling an animal in its mother's milk is cruel and unnecessary. Whatever the reason, observant Jews generally avoid mixing <em>any</em> (land-based) meat (so you can poach salmon in milk, but not chicken, even though neither animal produces milk at all) and <em>any</em> dairy (so a beef hamburger with cheese is also impermissible, even though there is no boiling going on), just in case.
</li><li> According to St. Thomas Aquinas, this is the explanation for the differences between the Nicene Creed and the older, shorter Apostles Creed. The Nicene Fathers added lines to the Apostles Creed to specifically address the heresies that the Council of Nicea had been convened to address. For example, the phrase "for us men and for our salvation" was added to address Origen of Alexandria's belief that Christ died to save Satan and demons as well; the phrase "he came down from heaven" was added to address Photinus' belief that Christ was merely man who became divine by living a good life.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Zero III himself states</a> that the fact that the Secondary Chromatic Doors can't be unlocked until after the Primary ones close serves solely to prevent easy cheating.
</li><li> Anyone can go through Chromatic Doors back and forth, but first they must escape from the puzzle room that's beyond the CDs. This prevents the nine players from returning to the warehouse empty-handed: the AB games would be pointless if no one had the keycard to enter the rooms.
</li><li> Zero III forces all nine players to play the AB game in the first round, but later on you find out that you can in fact not participate, which will make your vote default to ally. So if everyone just threw away their AB cards and didn't vote, the whole group would be out in 3 rounds, and there'd be no worry about trust because you could just <em>see</em> that your opponent(s) never entered their AB room. Which is why there's <em>also</em> a rule that if no member of a triad votes, all three of them die immediately.
</li><li> Anyone who has 9 BP or more can open the number nine door. So if you haven't enough BP, you just have to sneak out when someone else opens it, right? Wrong. If you cross the door and you have less than 9 BP, you die. So only people who have 9 BP or more can actually escape safely. This scenario is specifically addressed in-game.

</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> has strict rules and criteria on a potential candidate from the start, more than once they momentarily added new rules after a couple of hassles in the cleanup thread.
<ul><li> After a few tropers proposed their own works as a Complete Monster candidate (which due to the creator's bias, makes the candidate suggestion rather uncertain), the cleanup thread quickly added a new rule by disallowing other tropers from proposing their own creations unless another troper does it in their stead.
</li><li> Additionally, tropers often try to bring up other fan-made websites as proof that the candidate deserves the trope despite the fact that other websites often have different perception on what counts as Complete Monster. The thread eventually added a new rule by disallowing them from bringing up other sites to back their claims up.
</li><li> A couple of tropers tried to bring in candidates from pointless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorturePorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorturePorn">Torture Porn</a> movies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">make even</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">Nightmare Fetishist</a>s wet their pants in terror such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHumanCentipede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHumanCentipede">The Human Centipede</a></em> &amp; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASerbianFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASerbianFilm">A Serbian Film</a></em>, or grimdark fan fics that are dark for the sake of being dark when the original media itself is lighthearted in comparison. Soon after, a new rule was added that disallows "pointless grimdark" content.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, there is a sport called pro-bending, in which two teams made up of one waterbender, one earthbender, and one firebender compete (there aren't enough Airbenders in the world to be included in the rules). Korra, as the Avatar, is the <em>only living person</em> capable of bending more than one element. When she joins a pro-bending tournament as a waterbender but reflexively earthbends to block a shot, the referee calls "Foul!... I think." After a brief recess, the officials apply the patch: the Avatar can compete, but may only bend one element.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode has the group play a game that Otto thought up. Otto repeatedly makes up rules on the fly, eventually causing Reggie to snap and call him out in front of everyone else. This also shows the downside to this trope, because eventually everyone else stops playing because of the "rules" and eventually leaves Otto and Reggie basically trying to play "HORSE", which she uses as a distraction while making Otto do a complicated move to piss off and go surfing with Twister and Sam.
</li><li> Another episode involved the school principal catching Otto, Reggie, and Twister playing street hockey on school grounds and plans on punishing them. Sam (who was the hall monitor in the episode) comes to the rescue by showing that the rulebook has a specific list of activities not allowed on school grounds, but that hockey is not on the list. After the principal realizes Sam's in the right, he lets the kids go, but says that the next day the rule would be rewritten to include hockey.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> has at least two examples of this:
<ul><li> In the first Christmas episode, Timmy wishes that everyday was Christmas, which eventually messes things up since fairies lend their power to Santa for the holiday. Once everything is fixed, a new rule is added to Da Rules that forbids an "Everyday Christmas wish" from ever being granted again.
</li><li> In <em>Fairly Odd Baby</em>, it's discovered that fairies are no longer allowed to have children after Cosmo was born (since Jorgen Von Strangle feared there being another idiot like Cosmo). Timmy decides to wish that Cosmo and Wanda would have a child. Jorgen intervenes in order to stop the wish, but as it turns out Da Rules doesn't have a rule forbidding wishing for fairies to have a baby. Jorgen allows the wish to be granted, but from that day forward Da Rules now states that such a wish can no longer be granted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wayside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wayside">Wayside</a></em>: In "He Is It", Todd learns the hard way that Myron <em>cannot</em> be tagged "it" during recess. Because this is Wayside, whoever becomes "it" becomes ruler of the school, and everyone knows Myron goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">mad with power</a> whenever he is tagged.
</li><li> Done by Twilight Sparkle at the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "School Daze" to get around the rule that "<em>all</em> schools in Equestria must meet EEA guidelines." Because she can't get accredited by Chancellor Neighsay (due to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">legitimate</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racial</a> reasons), she instead creates a new rule that simply declares "<em>friendship</em> schools are exempt from this rule".
