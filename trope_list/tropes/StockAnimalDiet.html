</p><p>Which food the animal character loves is determined mostly by the character's species and is usually universal across series, companies, and even media. Sometimes these diets are true.

Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell">bats are creepy</a>, expect bats in fiction to be of the bloodsucking type (and, if they speak, speaking with an eastern European accent, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireVords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireVords">Vampire Vords</a>), despite those being a minority in the bat order (3 species out of 1,240) and mostly exclusive to Latin America.

The sole exception is in documentaries and educational series, in which case you can likely expect real facts and sometimes even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about bats being important to nature — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BearInTheBigBlueHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BearInTheBigBlueHouse">Bear in the Big Blue House</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues">Blue's Clues</a></em> have all done this.

When Batman hears a report about this he grumbles to himself that Langstrom couldn't have used fruits bat for his experiments. Granted, Langstrom's motivation was to be feared as the "ultimate" bat, so he likely chose vampire bats on purpose.
</li><li> <em>The Butterfly Ball</em>: The Brown Bat is accurately portrayed as an insectovore ... which still comes under "bats are creepy", given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">many of the characters are insects</a>.

Honey. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">This one is actually true</a>. Bears go mad over honey and will raid hives when they find them. The crunchy bee larvae are a protein-packed bonus. In fact, some languages' word for "bear" actually translates to "honey-eater"; <em>see</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianLanguage">Russian</a> медведь <em>medvédʹ</em>. Bears go absolutely gaga over <em>any</em> sweet food; it's genetic. Condensed milk is a perennial favorite of polar bears, who hardly ever have anything sweet in their normal diet. Aside from honey, fish, berries, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">contents of pick-a-nic baskets</a> are the only things bears will typically eat in fiction. However, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Bears Are Bad News</a> is in play, you can expect them to also eat humans, which real life bears hardly ever do, and when they do it's normally because they're sick or starving. Bears are omnivores, after all, and campers in bear territory have to store their food where hungry and curious ursines can't get at them (usually, this means a tree branch high and strong enough to carry the pack, but inaccessible to even the most determined bear).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lcsl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lcsl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lcsl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Really, bears are remarkably humanlike, what with the omnivory, relative intelligence, somewhat similar walking, and even occasional bipedalism; it's no wonder people are so fascinated by them.</span> Anthropomorphic bears might also be seen eating porridge as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">reference</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeBears">The Three Bears</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em>. No bears appear, but the hero's name means "bear". Or rather, it's a kenning for it, because what it literally means is "bee-wolf" — the animal that acts like a wolf toward bees.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBerenstainBears">The Berenstain Bears</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">the bears are basically humans in the books' world</a>, so they pretty much eat anything else that's edible. It's pretty fitting since, as noted above, bears are omnivores (like humans). Still, they especially love honey, berries and fish. For example, in <em>...No Girls Allowed</em>, Mama and Papa lure the boys to the girls' clubhouse with a lunch of barbecued honeycomb and salmon, and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode">Thanksgiving Episode</a> <em>...Give Thanks,</em> after Sister becomes attached to the live turkey who was supposed to be their dinner, they end up having a honey-baked salmon instead.

Unfortunately, this becomes one of the first instances of her mother succumbing to the bear's instincts. In the previous scene, Merida wakes up to find that Elinor has gathered a meal of berries — though this probably isn't <em>too</em> linked to her bear instincts, as Merida has to inform her the berries are poisonous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrotherBear">Brother Bear</a></em>: Fish is depicted as the main diet of the movie's bears. The sequel also has berries, which is another thing that bears eat.

Fish, meat, mice/rats, and/or birds. Cats, ambush predators who went after pretty much any animal smaller than them, were originally domesticated to hunt mice and other animals that infest grain stores. Of course, with fictional cats, actually <em>catching</em> mice or birds is very rare. They can have better luck with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish">fish</a> though, at least sometimes; for many pet owners, tuna fish is like cocaine to their cats. Unfortunate too, as due to the mercury content in an unfortunate amount of tuna, it's not good for them in large amounts. Milk is also a popular treat for fictional cats, despite the fact that many cats can end up being lactose intolerant in real life. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ub2y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ub2y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ub2y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> As with humans, though, feline lactose intolerance doesn't mean that it can't still be a highly desired foodstuff. One just does not want to be a bystander when it hits the other end (if it has a chance to).</span> In the dairy vein, cats generally <em>love</em> cheese, especially ones that have been aged a bit (as those have more of the lactose fermented away). Despite media sensationalism of cats eating dead owners, this behavior is actually much more common amongst <em>dogs</em> than it is cats. Cats are very picky about eating already dead meat (ever wonder why your cat would prefer to catch a mangy bird off your balcony than eat the expensive food you buy for him? This is why) and so generally only eat carrion as a last resort, while dogs are scavengers who will eat just about anything they can find, carrion or no. Catnip is sometimes portrayed, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighOnCatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighOnCatnip">treated like a narcotic</a>. In reality, catnip is not addictive despite the cats who are affected by it seeming "high".

Bones, most commonly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFemurBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFemurBone">Stock Femur Bones</a>. This is only partly true because dogs love <em>chewing</em> on bones, since the act of chewing relieves stress and boredom. Actually <em>eating</em> bones isn't the point, and can lead to throwing them back up if their stomach gets irritated from the bone shards. Many dog-owning tropers can attest to the fact that dogs will chew almost anything they're given.

Please. Sharp bone shards are a recipe for sky-high vet bills and/or a dead dog.</span> They may be after the marrow <em>inside</em> the bones as well, or the connective-tissue coating (periosteum) that fresh bones have on their surfaces. Also sausages, and a common gag in cartoons is a dog running along with a sausage link, possibly being chased. In British comics, back in the days when butcher's shops were more common, dogs loving meat products, longingly looking at a butcher's shop window with their tongues hanging out and trying to steal strings of sausages from butchers making deliveries was almost as frequent as depicting dogs eating bones. Other commonly depicted, safer doggy delicacies include steak, bacon, cheese, and peanut butter; in darker works they also enjoy corpses, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> due to most canines being part-time scavengers (in fact, there are reports of dogs eating toes or sometimes even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">testicles</a></em> off of their apparently-dead owners, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">when the owners are still alive</a></em>).

Most works of fiction (and documentaries) tend to depict dromaeosaurs hunting down animals much larger than themselves. While they certainly were capable of taking down large animals, it wasn't nearly as common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. It's now believed that "raptors" prefered to hunt down smaller to medium-sized prey while only taking down larger prey during opportune moments (IE: very old, sick, or injured individuals that would be easier to take down). Likewise, there was a limit to the size of prey they could take down. Expect fiction to forget this and feature <em>Velociraptor</em> taking down a dinosaur that would've been much too big for it in reality. Let's also not forget that <em>Velociraptor</em> was the size of a turkey at best; the person-sized species that matched the profile of the traditional raptor was <em>Deinonychus</em>. There were also a few larger (grizzly-sized) species such as <em>Utahraptor</em>, <em>Dakotaraptor</em>, or <em>Achillobator</em>.
<hr/><ul><li> <em>Deinonychus</em> will almost always be depicted taking down a <em>Tenontosaurus</em>. While there is some debate over whether they could take down a full-grown <em>Tenontosaurus</em>, they were certainly capable of hunting juveniles.
</li><li> <em>Velociraptor</em>:
<ul><li> Many works of fiction and documentaries depict <em>Velociraptor</em> hunting <em>Protoceratops</em>, inspired by the discovery of a fossil of a <em>Velociraptor</em> and a <em>Protoceratops</em> locked in combat before they were presumably being buried in a landslide.
</li><li> If humans are featured, expect <em>Velociraptor</em> to immediately put them on the menu. While it probably would take more than one <em>Velociraptor</em> to take down an adult human, the situation would likely be more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> in reality since humans would be quite capable of hunting dromaeosaurs (especially <em>Velociraptor</em>, which, again, were poultry-sized) as a food source, and (given that dromaeosaurs are maniraptors and very close cousins to modern birds) probably think they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken">taste like chicken</a>.

Or for that matter, just don't — wildlife officials generally urge not to feed at all, as it causes the wildlife to lose its healthy fear of humans, turning them into pest animals.

Peanuts and buns (UK). The peanut concept is a result of gullible circus audiences being persuaded to buy overpriced peanuts to eat for themselves or to feed to the animals. After the show, the elephants go back to their pens and eat hay. In real life, elephants can only digest about 40% of what they eat, so in one day they need approximately 400 to 600 pounds of food. Needless to say, if they go for peanuts exclusively, they're dead. The real "nut" that elephants are crazy about is <em>coco</em>nuts, which they love so much they'll eat it with its shell. They also eat coconut palm tree leaves on a regular basis. Elephants also have a love for chocolate more than peanuts and also a hankering for sugarcane, even robbing sugar cane trucks in Thailand. Elephants apparently also love watermelon; an Animal Planet show shows them eating it enthusiastically. Probably justified, since it's sweet (which often means a high-energy food) and extremely juicy (it's not called a <em>water</em>melon for nothing). They also like bananas. Buns are partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; elephants in captivity do enjoy eating bread, and the buns would also have been sugary, and partially British zoos' equivalent of the peanuts (in the days before there were signs saying "Do not feed the animals" — the erratic behaviour that led to London Zoo selling Jumbo is now believed to be due to tooth problems caused by this diet).

Captive primates do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">go ape</a> for bananas, though bananas cultivated for humans are too sugary for some species and it's basically like giving them candy, and should not be a staple (and anyway, they love grapes even more); at least one zoo actually had to stop giving bananas to their monkeys because they had too much sugar, causing their teeth to rot. Sometimes primates are shown just liking fruit in general, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for most primates, though many of them are omnivores. Concerning the great apes, gorillas mostly eat either roughage or fruit depending on the species (fruits aren't widely available in most gorilla habitats); in fact, when given bananas, they usually prefer to eat the pith (the white stringy stuff in the peel) instead of the flesh. Meanwhile, chimpanzees are mostly herbivores but well known for fishing for termites and hunting small animals like monkeys, antelope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies">infants of rival troops</a>, while orangutans are the biggest frugivores of the apes, preferring the much-dreaded durian, a giant spiky fruit said to smell like gym socks (they have been observed eating the meat of small mammals like squirrels and lorises, but they dont actively hunt like chimpanzees do and researchers believe they're primarily opportunistic scavengers, i.e. the animals they eat are already dead). Primates may also be seen eating nuts.

Humans, or anything else in the ocean (including fish, which is true). Seals and sea lions in more accurate works, with different species having different preferences. This one is especially unfair, given the relative rarity of someone being attacked by a shark, let alone actually being <em>eaten</em>. Sharks can and do bite with deadly results, but it's because biting is their way of figuring out what something is. It isn't their fault humans are so fragile. Additionally, they may simply assume that the figure swimming on the surface is a seal or a sea lion and take a chomp—the unlucky human survives if the shark realizes their mistake and loses interest before said human can bleed to death. Notably, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> that the scent of blood can throw sharks into a feeding frenzy. This is actually used by tour guides for people who want to swim with sharks. First, some fish is cut up and thrown in front of the sharks, while the divers lay low. When the sharks have sated their appetite and calmed down, the divers can swim among them in relative safety.

<ul><li> Green iguanas can and usually do subsist on plants only. But they will actually eat meat if it's easily available and doesn't require too much biting. Moreover, pet iguanas go gaga for chafer grubs. Also, the iguana can make the tip of its tongue slightly sticky — simply by flexing the tongue the right way.
</li><li> A variation on this is that frogs — amphibians, not lizards, but regardless — will <em>always</em> be seen eating houseflies <em>exclusively</em>, when in reality they're much less picky about what they do eat. Most species of frogs and toads will eat anything that is smaller than themselves and doesn't have a good defense like a noxious taste, including smaller conspecifics, and in some cases they will even take on larger prey.
</li></ul></li><li> A few lesser known examples: Alligators love chicken, Crocodiles enjoy rats, and Caimans primarily subsist on fish. A fairly obscure extension for alligators is that they absolutely adore marshmallows. It's obviously not something they can live on, but they'll also eat fruit as part of enrichment. Like <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/9xVwIuB-Xm4">watermelon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Porcupines are salt addicts, due to the lack of sodium in their normal diet (tree bark &amp; leaves). This is why you should never leave wood- or leather-handled tools or unwashed socks outdoors overnight in porcupine country, as they'll gnaw on sweaty grips or eat fabric for the sweat that permeates it. Avi did his research, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromDimwoodForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromDimwoodForest">Poppy</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear">Grumpy Bear</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> porcupine friend, Ereth, have a literal addiction to salt (especially salt lick; Poppy and her mouse family get him him for his birthday in the novel <em>Ereth's Birthday</em>).
</li><li> Songbirds and worms. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife">Occasionally</a> they will eat insects. Or breadcrumbs, if the focus is on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomelessPigeonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomelessPigeonPerson">friendly Bird Woman</a>.

</li><li> Although they don't encounter it in nature, elephants LOVE chocolate. One episode of "Inside Nature's Giants" had a team of biologists determining the inner contents of an enclosure elephant's digestive system by feeding it a recording device with a chocolate outer coating.
</li><li> If you have a pet rabbit, they will eat all sorts of things, including human food. However, none of it is good for their delicate digestive systems, except romaine lettuce.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC03dc5Pgms">this YouTube video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a squirrel eating a BIRD!

</li></ul></li><li> Asian palm civets, known as <em>luwak</em>, eats (among other things) coffee fruit.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note81wwl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note81wwl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note81wwl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The civet, contrary to what some may assert, does eat a wide variety of other things, particularly small mammals and fruit. It wouldn't make sense if it only ate coffee beans; coffee is native to Ethiopia and Yemen and was only introduced to Indonesia by the Dutch about 300 years ago—hardly long enough for an animal to evolve to have such an exclusive diet.</span> After passing through the animal's digestive system, the beans are then turned into the most expensive brand of coffee in the world... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation">TMI</a>?
<ul><li> It's unclear whether the coffee's flavor is changed by the digestive juices or if the civet is simply able to detect the best beans. It's probably a combination of both.
</li></ul></li><li> Cats love ham and pork. Bacon is often too salty, but cooked pork and ham are safe to feed as a treat. They also adore cheese, even if they aren't interested in regular milk. Some like to lick (or even eat) watermelon and/or cucumbers.
</li><li> Rats eat virtually anything people do, which is why they thrive in our cities, but they're especially fond of scrambled eggs.
</li><li> People usually think of monkeys and apes as vegetarians, but chimps and baboons will readily kill and eat small animals, including small monkeys. Chimps also love termites, using spit-moistened twigs or blades of grass to get them.
</li><li> Big cats:
<ul><li> Lions are invariably shown as predators of zebras, wildebeest, antelopes, and buffaloes.
</li><li> Tigers hunt water buffalo, deer, and wild boar.
</li><li> Cheetahs prefer gazelles.
</li><li> Leopards are generally shown to be hunting antelopes and monkeys.
</li><li> Jaguars are usually portrayed as predators of tapirs, caimans, capybaras, and turtles.
</li></ul></li><li> In nonfiction, grey wolf packs are typically shown preying on moose, elk, caribou, and bison.
</li><li> Giraffes are commonly described eating acacia leaves.
</li><li> Dinosaurs:
<ul><li> In older dinosaur books, <em>Baryonyx</em> will always be mentioned as a fish-eating dinosaur (with maybe <a class="urllink" href="http://chasmosaurs.blogspot.ca/2012/02/vintage-dinosaur-art-collins-gem.html">one exception<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), although this is probably true for spinosaurids as a whole.
</li><li> Also in older dinosaur books, <em>Coelophysis</em> will typically be eating its own young, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">bones once attributed to juvenile coelophysoids more likely came from nondinosaurian reptiles</a>.
</li><li> Also in older dinosaur books, <em>Oviraptor</em> tends to eat the eggs of other dinosaurs. In fact, it was <em>named</em> "Egg Thief" because its fossil was found next to a clutch of eggs. However, this may be a subversion and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> due to studies showing that those eggs were its own, and was trying to take care of them instead! Its current diet is something of a mystery, but science leans towards most likely omnivore (this of course means eggs are still potentially on the table, just unlikely to be its primary source of food).
</li><li> Much like <em>Oviraptor</em>, ornithomimids and <em>Troodon</em> often take roles as nest-raiders as well. Although the latter usually goes after hatchlings rather than eggs and its victim usually being <em>Maiasaura</em>. However, for ornithomimids this has fallen out of practice as of late and nowadays they are portrayed as omnivores with a slight herbivore leaning.
</li><li> Therizinosaurs were once considered piscivores or insectivores, but these days, they'll invariably be mentioned as unusual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianCarnivore">herbivorous theropods</a>. In really, really old works when they were still paleontological enigmas, they were portrayed as ferocious carnivores that used their massive claws to eviscerate other dinosaurs (this is where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis">Dino Crisis</a></em> got their portrayal).
</li><li> <em>Allosaurus</em> is generally shown as the mortal enemy of <em>Stegosaurus</em> and the various sauropods of the Jurassic period (<em>Diplodocus</em>, <em>Brachiosaurus</em>, <em>Apatosaurus</em>). Definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for the former as fossils of <em>Stegosaurus</em> and <em>Allosaurus</em> with grievous injuries from each other exist. The latter is a subject of debate among dino-buffs though. Juveniles might have been more preferable. Lesser known in popular fiction, but universally accepted amongst scientists is that the <em>Iguanodon</em>-like <em>Camptosaurus</em> was a big part of <em>Allosaurus</em>' diet.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Gastornis</em> (aka <em>Diatryma</em>), the large flightless bird, was traditionally portrayed as a hunter of small horse-like ungulates such as <em>Hyracotherium</em>. This is now a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, as isotope analysis have shown it was actually a herbivore that used its powerful beak to crack open nuts or snap branches (though this has yet to catch on in popular media, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">for fairly obvious reasons</a>).
</li><li> The standard fictional pterosaur is an eagle-like carnivore capable of carrying off a man, but in more realistic portrayals of pterosaurs, they're almost always depicted as fish-eaters based on the behavior of the most famous pterosaurs <em>Pteranodon</em> and <em>Rhamphorhynchus</em>. Real pterosaurs ran the gamut of dietary preferences though.
<ul><li> The gigantic <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em> was frequently depicted as a vulture-like scavenger in early paleoart, due to living in more terrestrial areas than the coastal <em>Pteranodon</em> and based on its anatomy being adept at soaring flight. The most common invocation of this was usually depicting flocks of <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CirclingVultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CirclingVultures">circling</a> over herds of migrating dinosaurs, waiting for one of them to keel over from exhaustion so they can swoop down and eat the remains. Later findings suggest that <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em> would have been a more active hunter like a giant stork, striding or even galloping along to snatch up small animals with their long toothless beaks; nowadays, it seems <em>Quetzalcoatlus</em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a> has become live baby sauropods. And sometimes live baby <em>T. rexes</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>other</em> famous non-dinosaurs, marine reptiles (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, pliosaurs), are typically depicted eating fish, turtles, cephalopods, or seabirds, all of which are consistent with the fossil record. The large mosasaurs, like <em>Tylosaurus</em>, also tend to be depicted with a particular fondness for eating <em>Pteranodons</em> that they snatch out of the sky midflight (no fossil evidence exists for this behavior—barring <em>Pteranodon</em> and <em>Tylosaurus</em> living in the same environment—and even if it did occur, the mosasaur would almost certainly have attacked the flying reptile while it was <em>in</em> the water rather than flying over it). Sometimes, the sea reptiles are also shown going for each other, which is not out of the question for large mosasaurs and pliosaurs.
</li><li> Harlequin shrimp eat starfish and nothing but.
</li><li> Sperm whales are typically mentioned as predators of giant squid (they compromise 80% of its diet!). Baleen whales are, of course, plankton and krill eaters.
</li><li> Rays are usually shellfish-eaters, although manta rays are plankton-skimming filter feeders.
</li><li> Starfish are commonly portrayed as predators of clams and mussels.
</li><li> Octopus and squid are typically portrayed as predators of fishes and crabs, which does apply for most species. The bigger ones are usually shown as man-eaters, despite there being no actual reports of this happening.
</li><li> Harpy eagles are known for being predators of monkeys and sloths, which form about half their diet, but they'll take on any sorts of prey such as macaws and even deer.
<ul><li> The Philippine eagle is also often shown eating monkeys in books and documentaries, and was even known as the monkey-eating eagle at one point. However, the name was changed due to the discovery that monkeys are <em>not</em> its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>— it prefers to feed on flying lemurs and cloud rats.
</li></ul></li><li> Flamingos are often said to be shrimp-eaters, but this is a generalization (the greater flamingo does eat crustaceans, but the lesser flamingo mostly feeds on algae).
</li><li> Parrots and toucans are often thought of as frugivores or at least herbivores, but they will occasionally eat smaller animals such as insects, frogs, rodents, and even other birds.
</li><li> Pelicans are famous for their affinity for fish, and indeed are specialized for feeding on such meals. Occasionally, however, they've been known to go after smaller birds, though the reason behind this is not known.
</li><li> Storks, at least in Eastern Europe, are stereotypically associated with eating frogs (and thus appear as villains or menaces in stories about frogs).
</li><li> <em>Smilodon</em>, the saber-tooth tiger, is generally shown hunting mammoths, giant ground sloths, and early humans. Scientists believe that the North American populations preferred bison, camels<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note965is');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note965is" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note965is');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Prehistoric camels were far more widespread and diverse than today's desert dwellers</span>, and horses, though it wouldn't pass up a mastodon stuck in a tar pit, given that <em>Smilodon</em> is the most common carnivore found in the La Brea Tar Pits. Woolly mammoths were not part of their diet as they didn't share the same habitat (the massive Columbian mammoths, on the other hand), but other species of sabertooths (like <em>Homotherium</em>) might have hunted juveniles. For ground sloths, they would have gone after smaller bear-sized species like <em>Megalonyx</em> or <em>Paramylodon</em>, while large ones like <em>Megatherium</em> or <em>Eremotherium</em> were off-limits. South American <em>Smilodons</em> hunted the local unique herbivores, such as hippo-like <em>Toxodon</em> or <em>Macrauchenia</em>, which resembled a humpless camel mixed with a elephant, as well as horses, deer, and llamas (and maybe the heavily armored glyptodonts if they felt lucky). They also co-existed with the elephant-like gomphotheres, such as <em>Notiomastodon</em>, though they most likely preferred to go after the calves. They never hunted humans as far as we know, but we do know that the aforementioned <em>Homotherium</em> was a contemporary of European cavemen, so it's not out of the realm of possibility.
</li><li> Giant ground sloths are often portrayed as omnivorous in fiction based on a controversial theory that they may have supplemented their diet with meat. It's more likely they were purely herbivorous, but when portrayed as meat-eaters, expect it to be carrion stolen from a sabertooth cat. Some go a little further to have them using their massive claws to tear prey to pieces!
<ul><li> Other depictions of giant ground sloths show them eating avocados, based on a hypothesis that avocados coevolved with ground sloths and other prehistoric South American megafauna. The idea is that avocados look like fruits ready to be eaten whole by a large animal, with the pit being pooped out ready to sprout, but no animal currently alive in the region where avocados are from is big enough to eat an avocado whole. Quetzal birds, by the way, can eat avocados whole and disperse their seeds that way. Humans, the theory goes, basically saved avocados from extinction by taking the effort to cultivate them. Humans still cant swallow avocado seeds though.
