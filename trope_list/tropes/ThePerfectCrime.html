<ul><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, Johan Liebert, is pretty good at this. It takes around half of the seventy-four episode series for Tenma to prove that Johan even <em>exists.</em> And even then, the police <em>still</em> don't believe him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> could probably be seen as deconstruction: when it comes to committing crimes without leaving evidence, it doesn't get much better than giving people fatal heart attacks by writing their names in a magical notebook, right? Well, enter "L", the world's greatest detective, who in one bold maneuver narrows the field of search from the entire world to a small part of Japan and comes up with some pretty good insights into the background and character of Kira based on who died when and how.
</li><li> A number of murderers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> intentionally arrange to have "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meitantei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meitantei">Meitantei</a>" Mouri Kogoro witness their crime, so confident are they that they can have the "Great Detective" himself provide them with a foolproof alibi. (And usually, they would be right too, even with Conan on the job, save for some completely coincidental bit of bad luck that provides the crucial evidence necessary to link them to it.)
</li><li> Every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro">Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro</a></em> is about some killer who pulls off either a ridiculously intricate murder or a ridiculously intricate alibi. Or both, or both at once. Neuro only manages to solve the cases because of his "777 Underworld Tools."
</li><li> In-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>: The latest of Ashirogi Muto's manga is about kids who pull off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime">perfect crimes</a>, though they're mostly anonymous pranks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is a big plot point in the third arc. Keiichi tries to figure out how to commit one by talking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByTelevision">his mom</a> with whose help he decides that the perfect crime is one that was never committed (or leaves no trace of being committed). He then attempts to do this and murders Satoko's uncle, although the method he actually uses - burying the body in the woods - is pretty shoddy. It winds up working anyway, but only because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of Sonozaki intervention</span> that really only winds up screwing him up even worse than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">he already was</a>.
</li><li> In a broader sense <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">every single arc ends in a perfect crime except the last one. It turns out that military Special Forces, with the full backing of the government, are even better at covering up crimes than Yakuza are. It isn't until Rika remembers the face of her killer in the final arc that the 'chain of mysterious deaths' is finally solved.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in pretty much every case of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> Manga. Every single chapter has the prosecution present a case that generally seems absolutely watertight, but Phoenix always manages to turn the case on its head and reveal that it's really just an example of this trope. <br/><br/>One of the main examples of this happens in "Turnabout Gallows". A murder occurs on an estate (where the victim was "struck with lethal force") and everyone but the defendant has a completely, 100% airtight alibi for the moment of the murder that even Phoenix himself can confirm, seeing as how he was there at the time. AKA; There was no one who was away from Phoenix's line of sight during the time of the victim's death apart from the defendant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The real killer actually set up a "timed murder"...and was able to kill the victim without actually having to be anywhere near him at the time, or without having to instate the killing blow. In reality, he set up a complex murder plot that made it so that, when the main breaker was shut off and the electricity went out, it would kill the victim.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> <em>Second Gig</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gouda</span> thought he'd figured out a loophole that would make him immune to prosecution for his crimes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was correct, but what he didn't anticipate was the Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">declaring his genius a national asset</a>, authorizing Section Nine to kill him when he tried to defect</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurokochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurokochi">Kurokochi</a></em> involves the famous 300 million yen robbery case, during which the eponymous sum of money was stolen by an unknown young man in a police uniform. In real life, it has yet to be solved, but in the manga, Kurokochi and Seike discover that the culprit <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hideto Kiritani was rapidly caught by the Public Security Investigation Agency. However, they kept silent about it because Kiritani was the son of a police commissioner, threatening to cause a scandal that would destroy the organization. Moreover, the Agency also wanted to keep the money to themselves</span>.

<ul><li> One issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> starred a mostly-retired villain who was seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">Laughably Evil</a> by the hero community. He ends up committing a series of bank robberies and gets away with it, baffling the city's heroes. No one suspected him so he got away with it completely. The only way he gets caught is when he gets frustrated at not having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">proper credit</a> so he tries to commit the crime a second time and purposefully gets captured so he could explain how he did it in court and rub it in the faces of the heroes and legal system. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He also had pre-planned his escape from the courthouse... and possibly the country.</span>
</li><li> In <em>X-Men Noir</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jean Grey kills Anne-Marie Rankin with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">Wolverine Claws</a> to frame her old pal Captain Logan. She then cuts up all distinguishing facial features and dyes both her and the body's hair, assuming Rankin's identity. The police decide to not investigate the murder when they see an X-Man tattoo on the body, thinking it's not worth taxpayer money to figure out which of "Jean"'s gangland boyfriends got tired of her first. This leaves Jean to wait out the years until "Rankin" turns 21 so she can collect on her trust fund. Oh, and one last thing; Rankin had the unique talent to absorb the personality traits of whoever was around her at the time. Meaning Jean was now impersonating someone with no fixed personality; she's just <em>that</em> good an actress. Robert Halloway figures it for the perfect crime... at least until he and his brother got involved and screwed it all up for her. One detail of such is that the body has apparently shrunk since it died, exposing the roots of its hair. That, or the cops didn't look closely at the body.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Bookhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Bookhunter">Bookhunter</a></em>, when agents Bay, Walker, and Finch figure out how "Kettle Stitch" stole a valuable book, Bay states that it <em>would</em> have been the perfect crime... if the M.O. didn't result in a missing library circulation card, which they were able to track down to discover Kettle Stitch's true identity.

</li><li> A made-for-television movie, <em>Guilty Conscience</em> starring Anthony Hopkins and Blythe Danner, has Hopkins as a defense attorney daydreaming various murder schemes to kill Danner to avoid a messy divorce. The twist is that, because he's a skilled lawyer, he pokes holes into his own proposed alibis - imagining himself on the docket - to where he's convinced himself he can never pull off "the perfect murder". Subverted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danner was plotting to kill him - with the help of his unhappy mistress! - and she simply shoots him, not burdening herself with any doubt of if she could pull it off.</span>
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em> had the first half of the episode as the criminal explaining his plan for the perfect murder followed by the actual murder where nothing went to plan. Despite this, the reason Sloan caught onto him wasn't because of the numerous mistakes but because of the "mountain of evidence" he had planted to frame someone else. It was the first case Sloan had where the suspect was so obvious that he thought it was suspicious.

It turned out that it was a cover for the murderer to obtain dog liver, to extract poison in the form of a "beef" tea. When they eventually catch him, after he has killed one wife, terminally injured his latest, and almost poisoned <em>Jack</em>, he declares it to have been a perfect crime due to it taking over thirty years to catch him.

The man is a genius and flaunts it, easily evading the questions in interrogation and basically mocking Jake and Holt on how they'll never be able to prove anything. Jake finally brings up the murder scene and how an award was smashed. He thus theorizes the man killed his partner in a fit of rage and managed to catch a break by the death taking place in a sterile room and further breaks to cover it up. Just as Jake figured, the idea that his brilliantly planned murder will be written off as nothing but dumb luck so outrages the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> that he confesses to how he planned out every detail and even how he got rid of the murder weapon.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>. Finn Abernathy is an intern who escaped from an abusive family, at around the same time his father disappeared mysteriously. Everyone is convinced that he killed his father and that he studied forensic pathology in order to see how he could get away with it. When Dr. Brennan confronts him directly on this, Finn states that he seriously thought about murdering his father, but his studies showed that Dr. Brennan was so expert at her job that she would find a way to prove that he did it, and so he never went through with it. Therefore, he didn't commit the perfect crime because he knew there was no such thing.

He's not exactly sane. And in chapter 5, he delivers on his plan. Details as follows: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He shuts himself in a building and ties himself up in a way that still allows for a little movement. He also stabs himself multiple times and sets up a spear hanging from the roof that will impale him if he lets go of the rope he's holding. Meanwhile, he kept the rest of the class distracted by sending them on a wild goose chase looking for bombs he had hidden, which turned out to just be fireworks that looked like bombs. After they go off, he had a video automatically play telling the class to meet him in the building he was tied up in. When they opened the door, it triggered a domino effect of Monokuma cardboard cutouts that tipped over a lighter and set a curtain on fire, causing everyone to run into the nearby factory for its fire extinguishing supplies. However, he had removed all of it except the fire extinguishing grenades. Since that was all that was available, everyone grabbed the grenades and tossed them onto the flame... and here's the masterstroke: <em>Nagito poisoned one of the grenades.</em> The poison would kill Nagito (making him let go of the spear) and dissipate before harming anyone else, his savagely injured and now spear-impaled body suggests that someone had tortured him for information about where the bombs were hidden and then killed him with the spear when he wouldn't talk, but the one who killed him is the one who threw the poisoned grenade. The result is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a> where the students can't help but vote incorrectly no matter how much of the crime they can figure out. At face value, they would believe someone tortured and killed him, but there's no evidence who did it and they obviously aren't admitting to it, so the class has to blindly guess who the culprit is, most likely getting it wrong. If they figured out his injuries were all self-inflicted, they would then believe it was a suicide and vote for him as the culprit, which is also wrong. If they figured out his entire plan to make someone else poison him, there's no way to know who did it, because even the <em>culprit</em> doesn't know they did it, again forcing them to blindly guess</span>. The evidence that found the killer is best described as a "hunch". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His actual goal was to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">the traitor</a> kill him because he found out that the rest of the class including himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">were members of Ultimate Despair</a> and thus he decided that the traitor was the only one who deserved to live. He didn't know who the traitor was but trusted his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Ultimate Luck</a> to deliver the poisoned grenade to the traitor's hands.

One episode was even titled "The Perfect Score" and had an FBI agent admitting that the crime was perfect. There were only a few clues that went straight to dead ends. The only reason the criminal was caught was that he tried to pull it off again, and the FBI noticed how similar the second (failed) crime was.
</li><li> It was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_and_Loeb">Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s goal to commit the perfect crime when they murdered fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks. They were bright young things who thought they might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Ubermenschen</a>. They made about a frillion mistakes. Just to demonstrate how far from perfect this attempt was, some of the more notable ones are: Leaving the body right by railroad tracks, where it was quickly discovered. Leaving a pair of eyeglasses belonging to one of them with an unusual hinge mechanism that had been bought by <em>three</em> people in the area. And on questioning, claiming that they had been out in their car, even though their <em>chauffeur</em> was repairing the car that night. Being seen together in their rented car at the time and place the kidnapping had occurred. Yeah, Moriarty these guys were not.
</li><li> In an early HBO special, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a> joked about what he considered the perfect crime; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">you pick up one person and use them to beat another person to death</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">They both die and there's no murder weapon</a>!
<div class="indent"><strong>"Cop":</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">Seems like a pedestrian accident to me. Must've been moving at quite a clip.</a>
</div></li><li> Two Malaysian men escaped hanging for drug trafficking because they were <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7876221.stm">twin brothers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the courts couldn't distinguish between the guilty brother and the innocent brother.
<ul><li> In the same vein, at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConjoinedTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConjoinedTwins">conjoined twin</a> once got away with murder because he couldn't be imprisoned without also imprisoning his innocent brother. When you think about it, conjoined twins may be The Perfect Criminals.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in Real Life according to David Simon's book, <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em>. Rule #10 in Homicide: There is such a thing as a perfect murder. Always has been, and anyone who tries to prove otherwise merely proves himself naive, romantic, and a fool who is ignorant of the first nine rules.
</li><li> Just look at Wikipedia's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_deaths">list of unsolved deaths<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which includes a huge amount of murders where the perpetrator was never found or even identified.
</li><li> There's actually a very popular argument that the perfect crime is one where nobody ever realizes a crime was committed. Take murder for example. If everyone (police, M.E., relatives, everyone) believe the victim died of natural causes, or in a tragic accident, then there is no murder to be investigated. The perfect crime. Thus, by definition, we will never know if the perfect crime has been committed because we never know that it occurred in the first place. To put it in perspective, there were 126,438 deaths in 2010 in the USA that were the result of accidental injury. If 1% of them were murders that were never recognized, that would be 1264 murders that were never identified as such or an 8.5% increase in the listed number of murders for that year.
</li><li> Laws that are struck down by courts remain on the books because legislators generally don't bother repealing them, so in a sense breaking them is the perfect crime. The law is unenforceable, so if caught you can never be convicted.
</li><li> The "Unabomber" was notorious partly because his attacks, successful or not, were practically devoid of useful clues. The bombs were made of atypical scrap parts and hand-carved wood, never contained any fingerprints (though one contained <em>someone else's</em> fingerprint), and were sent to a nearly-random series of people. The FBI didn't get much farther than "he's probably an academic who's obsessed with wood." He was only caught because he published a "manifesto" and his brother and sister-in-law recognized his writing style.
</li><li> Either played straight or subverted by legendary airline hijacker D.B. Cooper, depending on who you ask. On the one hand, he's the only person who ever successfully hijacked an airplane and escaped custody. On the other hand, many experts believe that this is because he died after jumping out of the plane in the dark over a remote stretch of Washington wilderness while wearing shoes and clothing that weren't suitable for the terrain or weather, which indicates a lack of skydiving and wilderness survival experience.
</li><li> It's been speculated that the small section of Yellowstone National Park that lies in the state of Idaho<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1d7wm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1d7wm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1d7wm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most of the park is in Wyoming, with some in Montana.</span> might be the perfect place to commit a murder. The theory is that it will be impossible to impanel a qualified jury because there are no persons who reside within both the State of Idaho and the judicial district that contains the park. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicinage_Clause#The_perfect_crime.3F">details<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even beyond that, the area is a wilderness — there are no paved roads in that part of the park — meaning that people don't go there very often, making it less likely the body would be found. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">Jurisdiction Friction</a> is also quite possible.
</li><li> Joseph Deangelo <em>almost</em> got away with the perfect crime for 44 years. He had raped 50 women, robbed over 100 homes, and killed 12 people as the East Area Rapist/Golden State Killer. <em>No one</em> saw his face, he wore gloves to deny police his fingerprints, he would call from phone booths or stay on the line for a short time so no one could trace his location. But there was one misstep in his crime spree, his DNA was found <em>everywhere</em> and for 4 decades his DNA sat quietly in Police laboratories until <em>finally</em> he was captured after matching his DNA with familial DNA on a website.
</li><li> A case of brazen criminal, ingenious loophole was that of former French courtesan and mistress of Edward VIII, Marguerite Marie Alibert. She shot and murdered her husband Ali Kamel Fahmy Bey in 1923, but because she had kept some highly incriminating letters sent to her by Edward VIII and threatened to reveal their scandalous liaison, she was acquitted. The remaining incriminating letters were found and destroyed after her death in 1971.
