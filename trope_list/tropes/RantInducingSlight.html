</p><p>This is sometimes what happens to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Pollyanna</a> character when something finally gets through their armor. Often, the ranting character is told to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan">get a hold of themselves</a>. Bonus points if the ranting character is in a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>. More points for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a>.

Also, occasionally, this is one result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">Science-Related Memetic Disorder</a> or other such syndromes, where ranting in this way is par for the course.

</p><p>If the others are feeling particularly jerkish, then then they may deliberately do such things to push the character over the edge, then stand back and watch said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass">character get lectured for the ensuring explosion.</a>
This can be an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Everyone's had a really bad day at some point and has had to struggle (often unsuccessfully) against exploding over something fairly minor. Both in real life and fiction, the target of the resulting explosion of anger is often someone completely innocent. In these cases, the person had nothing to do with the rest of the stuff that ticked the person off, they just happened to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, setting off a powderkeg of pent up stress and emotion. They may have given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">Unwanted Assistance</a> after seeing they've had a bad day. This particular version tends to result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment as the ranter calms down and realizes they chewed out an innocent or even extremely well-meaning person (who is now, understandably, extremely hurt). Of course, the person who provokes the rant-inducing slight may also have been the one who was <em>provoking</em> the ranter in the first place, with the ranter resorting to this after subtle hints have proven ineffective.

<ul><li> Minoru Shiraishi elevates this trope to epic status in one of the final episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>. The abuse heaped upon him by Akira-sama throughout the <em>entire series</em> at long last proves too much when she flings a bottle of water in his face - water he trekked into the mountains and fought with wild animals to obtain for her.
</li><li> Every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> has the eponymous character come across a certain something that leads to him going into full-on ranting mode before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">declaring he's in despair</a> because of it.
</li><li> Jagi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>. "Your ears look like my brother's. DIE!"

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a>: Canada is the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">woobie</a>, since nobody ever sees him and if they do, they think he's his brother America. Finally, when he gets into an argument with America, he explodes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> for <em>three hours</em>, reducing America to tears. He probably would have continued on if England hadn't taken pity on America and stopped him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Uryuu has natural talent at sewing, and he takes his skill in it very seriously. He has a natural flair for clothing design and an uncontrollable creative need to "improve" (re: feminise) any clothing he can get his hands on, which tends to please women and horrify men, who think he should stick to women's fashion. However, buttons are an issue for Uryuu... a big, big issue.
</li><li> Captain-Commander Yamamoto remained cool and composed for virtually the entire series, even when he was on the verge of killing his two finest students or giving up an arm in a bid to defeat Aizen. But the instant three of his captains return from battle having lost their captain's haoris, he loses it and begins ranting at them. Their casual dismissal of the haoris as useless (Kenpachi), cheap (Byakuya), and not stylish (Shunsui) makes things worse.
</li></ul></li><li> Rei's attempt to give Asuka advice on synching up with her mech has this effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, prompting Asuka to rant about how much she hates everything in her life, especially Rei.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro">Hamtaro</a></em>, the Ham-Hams get stuck on a frozen desert island and put all the pressure on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Maxwell</a> to come up with an escape plan, which drives him to this.
<div class="indent"><strong>Maxwell!</strong> I CAN'T THINK!!! <br/><strong>Oxnard:</strong> He's mad... <br/><strong>Howdy:</strong> Like a hornet... <br/><strong>Maxwell:</strong> Why can't you ever just rely on yourselves?! I'm just like you, just another Ham-Ham and maybe I'd like <em>you</em> to give <em>me</em> the answers sometimes! I can't <em>always</em> come up with solutions! I've got my off days too, you know! But instead, you guys act thick as logs and leave everything to me!
</div></li><li> In the second episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Pretty Sammy</a></em> OAV, Tenchi politely declined Bif Standard's offer for a free copy of his SynchroniCity operating system, saying that it's slow. This causes Bif to go into a rant on how standardization, among other things, is more important than speed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WhenSupernaturalBattlesBecameCommonplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WhenSupernaturalBattlesBecameCommonplace">When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace</a></em>, Hatoko has been friends with Jurai for years but has always been perplexed by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination">chuunibyou behaviour</a>, a fact that Jurai has been visibly disappointed by in the past. She manages to put on a happy face about it until she questions him about a clandestine meeting he had with one of their other friends and he responds with his usual line, "You wouldn't understand." Hatoko breaks down into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">now-famous</a> rant.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HisoneAndMasotan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HisoneAndMasotan">Hisone and Masotan</a></em>, after Hisone backs out of flying Masotan at the last moment, Kakiyasu tells her if she felt like that she should have spoken up sooner. This sets Hisone off, starting with pointing out that, as a matter of fact, she <em>did</em> speak up fifteen times before and was summarily ignored. She then goes on to compare Nao to a grade schooler, complete with attitude, and finishes off with the fact she likes orange yogurt, not the strawberry she was given.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko">Aggretsuko</a></em> naturally. It's a lot more common in the TBS shorts though. At one point, just failing to scrape the price tag off a vase is enough to send her into rage mode.
</li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bam saving Rachel from Hoh by using a technique he just saw pushes the latter off the far end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Realizing that he will never be able to achieve his dream (it's a long story), he begins to rant against Bam how just by his innate talent he was getting in the way of those who did not have as much power as he did and was thus crushing the dreams and lives of others. He says that in face of that his attempts of trying to be friends are just belittling and claims to have never seen Bam as a friend. He then commits suicide.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rachel was really having doubts about killing Bam, but those quickly vanished when he one-shotted the bull and showed her how far beyond her reach he was.</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Steve Rogers:</strong> I'll be honest with you, I might not be the best person to ask. I'm Bucky's best friend. It's like asking a wife to testify against her husband. You can't help but remember all the ways that person was good for you and all the reasons why you cared about them. And that can mess with your judgment. But I'll try and stick with the facts: the fact is that a man has been brainwashed for decades by an organization that we know has a history of murder, espionage, discrimination, persecution, and God knows how many other crimes. I'd also like you to consider Barnes's distinguished military career up until his supposed death while in action. If the kind of person like Barnes, with his venerated, untarnished career, is suddenly a killer for an organization like HYDRA, one that we know uses brainwashing techniques, wouldn't that make you think twice about persecuting him at the very least? And why — I'm sorry, why are we even discussing the death penalty? Why is this still a thing in our country, when — when we claim to be better than others while doing the same things that they do, that's where we start to lose our way. I think Buck — that Barnes, is a convenient patsy for the media. He's the big, scary assassin that everyone can blame. It's why Natasha Romanoff is still on trial after being the one to release the HYDRA files in the first place and risking her life repeatedly for the sake of this country: she's a convenient patsy. The government and the public likes to have a boogeyman to hate. If the government was truly interested in being fair, they would finish decoding and sorting all of the released HYDRA files before starting a manhunt. And where's the manhunt for Brock Rumlow? He publicly stated that he was for HYDRA, and he doesn't even get a blip on the radar. Barnes shouldn't be Public Enemy #1. The people at the top who gave him his orders and snuck into S.H.I.E.L.D. through the back door are the ones we should be going after. <em>[realizes he's gone on a bit of a rant and that everyone looks a bit taken aback]</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">I'm sorry, it's just... this hits a bit close to home, y'know?</a>

<ul><li> In "Dark Victory", Frasier has remained resolutely cheerful on his father's birthday despite a city-wide blackout and the fact that the others, who are all consumed with their own problems, seem determined to be miserable and have absolutely no fun at all. When he finally manages to get everyone cheered up, they're so pleased that they decide to go to a party downstairs instead of stay at the party he's organized, and it's only when someone (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">somewhat hypocritically</a>) tells him not to be a 'party-pooper' because he doesn't want to go that Frasier finally unleashes the rant that has been building up all episode.
</li><li> A later double-episode sees Niles' ex-wife arrested for murdering her boyfriend; she begins to badger Niles incessantly for his help. This displeases Daphne, who being pregnant at that point is exceptionally hormonal to begin with; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledToTheCouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledToTheCouch">she eventually forces him to sleep on the sofa</a>. Furthermore, Frasier has given a press-conference in which he's accidentally implied that Niles is an <em>accomplice</em>, so the media are circling them like vultures. All of which Niles accepts with almost Zen-like calm... until he goes to buy a coffee at his regular haunt to find that they've given away <em>the last straw</em>. After Niles has recovered from the following breakdown, which sees him strip naked in public, he takes great delight in telling his ex to get stuffed, but he then gets carried away and tells the rest of his family that they've been as much help to him in this extremely difficult time as a hole in his head. (Although one could argue they were asking for it)
</li><li> In one episode, it seems that Niles has adjusted to his new apartment, but when Martin says its the kind of place he'd live in, Niles tearfully shouts "Get me out of this hellhole!".
</li><li> In "Father of the Bride", Frasier is put in charge of Daphne and Donnie's wedding; unfortunately, it goes to his head and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">he ignores all of Daphne's ideas</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">tries to turn their wedding into his ideal wedding</a>. Daphne is too meek to tell Frasier to stop, that is until Frasier tells her "You'll thank me later," which is something Daphne's controlling mother use to say to get her way. This causes Daphne to snap and tell Frasier that she's doing HER wedding HER way.
</li><li> Not to mention "The Last Time I Saw Maris". First, Maris does the latest in a long line of inconsiderate things to Niles, which he dismisses as "eccentricities". Frasier tells him that he's repressing his emotions and asks him to let out his anger, causing him to yell, "I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble!" Later in the same episode, Niles is leaving Maris' house, having been perfectly cheerful through the entire process. Finally, as he is leaving, this happens...

What makes it not funny is that it happens at the beginning of the episode, so there was nothing strenuous going on; therefore, the scene shows the audience another part of Carrie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> nature.
<ul><li> A better comedic example of this is in the ep "Art House" where Doug tears Arthur a new one over how Arthur basically couldn't live on his own and wanted Doug to support him instead of coming back home.
</li><li> She gets another one in the episode "Steve Moscow". This time, the reason is more understandable (the lazy Russian mold removers were driving her crazy), and Doug makes a very good comeback: "Wow. Either you're mad about something else or I think I want a divorce."

Arthur is being stubborn and wants to fake a trip so he can hang out in Camelot in disguise, so Merlin finds a place for him to stay. While he's hiding with Gwen (and being a bit of a jerk to her, Merlin's best friend), he still makes Merlin do all his work. And Merlin has to work double for Gaius since "Arthur's gone". And Merlin has to help Arthur keep his cover, and... and... But he takes it all well. Until Gaius walks in on him having fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion mid-chore and tells him that he can't sit around and do nothing. Merlin explodes. (It's partly comedic because throughout his long rant Merlin has one small piece of hair sticking up adorably.)

This was also basically how the MST3K writers reacted to the scene when they first saw it.
<ul><li> It's important to note that it isn't simply a matter of the movie having stock footage; the stock footage was being used to pad-out the running time, so this involved them using the SAME stock footage every five minutes or so.

Throughout the first part, Joe is trying to do his normal responsibilities while dealing with assorted frustrations: Brian complaining about the current state of his sex life, Helen constantly talking about her current beau, Faye protesting a cemetery relocating one of her husbands, Roy incessantly playing his new radio ad, Lowell working on a motorcycle in the hangar, and a passenger complaining about a lost suitcase. Joe keeps it all bottled up, but when he finds and returns the suitcase after great difficulty, the passenger complains about a slight scratch. Joe responds by throwing the suitcase through his office window and proceeds to denounce everyone for what he's had to put up with all day. He then takes off on Lowell's motorcycle. Part 2 deals with the fallout of this, as Brian recognizes running the business really is too much for one man and Joe needs to balance work and relaxation. The status quo even changes, as the two become equal partners.

</li><li> He has another one after reading an email from someone claiming that the only reason he had put <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare3">Modern Warfare 3</a></em> at the top of his Worst List for the year was because he "just didn't like shooters". Seeing as he loves single-player shooters (except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">every game following in its footsteps</a>) he begins the rant "You ignorant little bastards!", and ends the rant by branding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">CoD</a>-style FPS games, which he doesn't consider to be true shooters, "spunk-gargle-weewee".
</li><li> His entire review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaneAndLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KaneAndLynch">Kane &amp; Lynch</a>: Dog Days</em> has shades of this, as he genuinely hates the game and is disgusted that it even exists, that he had to play it, and that he then had to talk about it.
</li><li> He actually does an ironic joke review to this effect with his first review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemForever">Duke Nukem Forever</a></em> (when it hadn't been released yet), all because he was pissed about the fact that they kept releasing trailers and screenshots for the game without even a guesstimate on the release date.
</li><li> And while the series <em>is</em> titled "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Zero Punctuation</a></em>" to reflect his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a> tendencies, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> X: Legacy</em> (or rather its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialDifficulty">Artificial Difficulty</a> in some instances) takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/vQs1uTTjTAM?t=4m15s">a sequence that has to be seen to be believed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Over the course of the series, he takes offense at politicians who publicly condemn him, a news anchor who wasn't flattering enough when doing a segment on Joker's origins, a casino owner who used his likeness as a mascot, judges at a comedy club who didn't like his old act... but Joker usually doesn't stop at rants.
