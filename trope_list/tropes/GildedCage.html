<ul><li> In the <em>Frozen Teardrop</em> novels, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Relena's great-aunt Sabrina</span> was locked away in a suite of her family's mansion, with her pet cat as her only companion.
</li></ul></li><li> Amuro Ray in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> has been living in a very nice mansion in the midwest USA since the end of the One Year War. However, he's effectively under house arrest there, with his movements constantly monitored by the Federation government. This occurs despite his war hero status because the Federation is terrified by the existence of Newtypes, and Amuro is one of the most powerful known Newtypes as well as an ace MS pilot, and they are worried he might revolt against them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Which he ends up doing, in part because of their treatment of him.</a>
<ul><li> It's revealed that some of the other surviving White Base crew also suffered the same fate. In Bright's case, it's being given the "privilege" of being a glorified chaffeur for the Federation's elite while his wife Mirai and their children Hathaway and Cheimin are forced to live in Jaburo as "hostages" to keep him in line. As with Amuro, this backfires: he soon joins the AEUG, and some time later Amuro and his allies rescue Bright's family and take them to actual safety.
</li></ul></li><li> The makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em> designed Nunnally's garden aboard the airship with this in mind. The garden is incredibly nice and well cared for, but it's also surrounded by a deep, empty moat, with only a single narrow bridge leading to the rest of the ship. Since Nunnally is blind and confined to a wheelchair, this makes it extremely difficult/dangerous for her to leave the garden without assistance. This ends up again prominent in a subtle fashion come the finale battle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nunnally is officially set to be the Empress of Britannia over her older brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Lelouch</a> supported by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Schneizel</a> and his forces, with a nuke armed floating fortress called "Damocles" as her new palace. However, the garden she's in this time puts her on a platform...which <em>only has stairs</em> leading off it, showing that she truly would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet Empress</a> if Schneizel won.</span>
<ul><li> Lelouch is also put in one of these at Ashford Academy. It's a nice school, and many of his friends are there, but in R2 he's constantly being monitored by government agents looking for signs that he's regained his lost memories and become the terrorist leader Zero again. However, once his memories are back thanks to C.C's sort-of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfLife">Kiss of Life</a> ... by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">Blackmail</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">emotional manipulation</a> on the agents sent to watch him, he soon turns the Gilded Cage into the Gilded Base For His Terrorist Operations.
</li><li> This was also the case for Empress Tianzi, who lived, well, like an empress in the Vermilion Forbidden City, but whose greatest desire was to leave and see the world. Luckily for her, she once spared a young officer from execution — and said officer, Li Xingke, swore to make Tianzi's wish come true. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He succeeded.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Clover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Clover">Clover</a></em>, the "greenhouse" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">Suu</a> was kept in. It's quite beautiful, but Suu has to live in complete isolation from the rest of the world, as she is powerful enough to defeat the government officials, and they "don't want that power to fall into the wrong hands."
</li><li> Rea in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sankarea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sankarea">Sankarea</a></em>. She is restricted from ever leaving her estate by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverProtectiveDad">Over Protective Dad</a> to where she is barely even allowed to go out to school to the point she sneaks off at night to scream into an abandon well of how she wish she wasn't born a Sanka. And when she starts to talk to a boy, her father even takes school away from her to be home schooled and orders that the boy she was hanging out with to be castrated. After this, she drinks a chemical that contains poisons plants in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">attempt to kill herself</a>. Though it instead did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">something else</a>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> when Zagato tells the Magic Knights that Emeraude has to "spend her whole life locked up in a cage" as a result of being Pillar. As Pillar, Emeraude was the most powerful person in Cephiro- but she had no freedom, at least not to have what she wished for the most <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (to be with the one she loved, Zagato, that is)</span>. Later echoed by the Magic Knights when the invaders wanted to take over Cephiro- especially when Aska wanted to be beautiful, and is told "but for who?", since the Pillar could not fall in love with anyone, lest their thoughts and wishes won't be for Cephiro anymore and it will start falling apart around them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>, Luctiana kidnaps Saito and Tiffania and takes them to her home in an oasis. They are allowed to roam around the paradise. Since they are in the middle of a desert, they can't possibly leave without a dragon or vehicle to ride.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, this is Eren's opinion of the last human city, although the conditions are somewhat worse than most of them (for example, there's so little farmland, meat is essentially a luxury item), with the only true advantage being relative safety from the Titans. Most of humanity is content to live in the walls indefinitely but Eren repeatedly calls it a bird cage and is determined to see the outside world.
</li><li> Deconstructed in the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, where a woman in this situation begs Wolfwood to free her and he is not inclined to help. He points out a starving bird and comments on how much it would like to have a life like hers. Since the setting is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>, freedom is not all it's cracked up to be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, when Sasuke is taken by Orochimaru he is given better living conditions in Orochimaru's compound than most of the test subjects. Subverted in that Sasuke is not an <em>unwilling</em> prisoner.
</li><li> A first season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">James</a> ran away from home and joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">Team Rocket</a> partially to get out of one of these and partially to avoid an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">girl</a> he hated.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCollector">Jirarudan</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Pokémon 2000</a></em> is confined to his luxurious airship, essentially a floating art museum, and it's distinctly implied that he has almost no contact with the outside world. Unlike many other examples, this seems to be self-imposed, and he doesn't consider it a prison (although the way it cuts him off from identifying with anything outside his ship qualifies it as such).
</li></ul></li><li> In the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Homura steals Madoka's godlike powers and resets the world so everybody else is normal and nobody remembers how the world used to be. This is all so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">Madoka can be safe and happy</a>. The problem is that when Madoka and Sayaka remember how the world used to be, they consider what Homura did to be wrong and want to break out, so Homura simply erases their memories, presumably every time they regain them.</span> Note the school which was very white in the anime, especially the roof with its lovely gothic cage. It is now literally gold-toned.
</li><li> During the Alfheim Online (ALO) Arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, Asuna's cage fits this description. It is a roomy, literally gilded birdcage, with a canopy bed, table setting, and gorgeous surroundings.

</div></li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, Lord Vetinari has a special section of his palace set aside for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Da Vinci, the dangerously brilliant Leonard of Quirm, separated from the rest of the palace by a secret passage full of potentially lethal traps. The twist is that Leonard doesn't actually mind it, or even consider himself to be imprisoned, since his particular cage is filled with enough paper and ink and bits of things to keep his mind occupied the whole time. In fact, the first time he was allowed out, a few days later he returned and locked himself back <em>in</em>, so that people who would turn his designs into terrible weapons could not get to him.
<ul><li> It is strongly implied that this is not, technically, a prison, as Leonard of Quirm can apparently leave it at will, having designed most of the traps. It is not made quite clear whether Vetinari knows this, nor whether either of them consider it a prison or just let everyone else think that.
</li><li> Vetinari seems to have this as something of a policy; he claims that you should never build a dungeon you wouldn't want to spend the night in because if you are overthrown the usurper will have you tossed in it. It's not exactly luxurious, but it <em>is</em> clean, airy, and free of any of the snakes and scorpions that his predecessor employed. There <em>are</em> rats, but only because Vetinari taught them how to eliminate the snakes and scorpions, and in gratitude they act as servants. There's also a hidden key, and the door can be bolted only <em>on the inside</em>. The man really thought this through.
</li><li> <em>Another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Vetinari</a> example: Moist von Lipwig finds his new life as Postmaster General to be this. He can go where he wants and do what he pleases... but he's under the watchful eye of a parole officer. Said officer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golem</a> who never sleeps, never stops working, is almost indestructible, and can sense Moist's location wherever he goes. He may be able to move around, but Moist is all too aware that he's still a prisoner.

</li><li> It's implied that the five-star housing of the victors is also like this. Once they've won the game, they're celebrities around Panem and are treated like it. However, the Capitol keeps a close eye on them, <em>because</em> they are now potentially influential celebrities.
</li><li> The wealthier districts have better living conditions but more brutal and fanatical Peacekeepers.

Fortunately, the Vigilantes and the Big Five eventually realized that they were stuck in these, and got out of them. <em>Deja Vu</em> reveals that Jellicoe put a reporter named Virgil Anders in one, because Virgil was writing a book about Jellicoe titled "Man, Myth, Monster", and Jellicoe objected to the "monster" part.

In theory, his father wouldn't act up again, knowing if he did his son would be killed. While Theon had all of the comforts of a highlord, he was still a prisoner and reminded of it frequently.

The journey to her new husband's castle takes well over a week, and by the time the woman gets there, she learns that the king has died from an unspecified natural cause. The King's Regent decides that the woman still has an obligation to fulfill and engages her to the deceased king's young son (estimated to be around 8-11 years old), with a warning that should she try to escape before marrying the prince, there will be <em>severe</em> consequences.

The mages get access to better and better quarters as they rise in rank, they have access to all of the resources a student of magic could ever desire, and they get all of their needs provided for them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">The Tranquil even make use of their talent for alchemy to brew fine ale</a>. Too bad they can't ever <em>leave</em> the Tower except on official Circle business unless they want to risk Death by Templar. The same Templars never let them out of their sight — always watching. Some mages learn to appreciate the benefits and opportunities the Circle provides and come to accept their restricted lives. Others... don't.
<ul><li> The restrictions aren't incredibly harsh in the Ferelden Circle, at least. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Awakening</a></em> you can run into a Circle mage doing research on alchemical plants, in the middle of nowhere without any kind of supervision, implicitly for weeks at a time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that the Knight-Commander in Ferelden is considered almost excessively liberal because he's willing to allow mages to leave the tower as long as they arrange it through proper channels.
</li><li> Zevran considers being an Antivan Crow to be this. You can be wealthy, respected and desired - provided you follow orders and never quite forget that you're expendable. Not to mention it involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> starting at a very young age.

In Act 2 there's a rather nasty point in which Ser Alrik is implied to be making mages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Tranquil</a> so he can use them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex slaves</a>. By Act 3, mages aren't even permitted to leave their cells. The Circle is even housed in a former prison complex, so the gilding was somewhat limited in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, Cassandra Pentaghast confides that her life before becoming a Seeker was very much like this. She's a distant cousin to Nevarra's royal family and descended from dragonslayers, although she's probably the only living member of the clan who has actually <em>killed</em> a dragon; as a child, she was the ward of her uncle, who didn't really have much to do with her, and she says that all she knew of Nevarra for a long time was what she saw through the window. She describes her state in the family as being like a porcelain doll, occasionally brought out to be shown off but generally just kept aside.

She was never able to go anywhere or have any real friends, mostly due to her family's status (her father was an extremely high-ranking noble, almost a king in his way) and the fact that her parents were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daedra worshipers who eventually became vampires, and forced her to become one as well</span>.

She's still in her lavish childhood home, the interior of which remains untouched by the scourge of Twilight, and although she seems to prefer to remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlInTheTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlInTheTower">in her tower</a>, there's nothing to suggest she can't visit other parts of the building as well.

The game compares them to jewels preserved in a glass case. However, as "perfect" the day might seem, some young folks like the Luckless Sister actively loathe the monotony of their life in Perdurance. Too bad they can't leave unless their parents displease Her Renewed Majesty.

It's suggested that the family who bought the land built the room as a place for Victini to hide in so it would be safe from those who would exploit its powers. After the player catches it, everyone agrees that it's safer in your hands.
</li><li> N's childhood room is another example. He grew up in a huge room, complete with a <em>half-pipe</em>... but that was the extent of his contact with the world until the events of the game.

The others range from ambivalent to (in the case of Veronica) enjoying living in relative luxury.
<ul><li> The Sierra Madre Casino became this when its security systems activated during the nuclear war, trapping the Gala Event guests inside to either starve to death or be killed by the Security Holograms.
</li><li> Vault 101 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> is another example. Providing you are willing to obey the Overseer, the dictator who runs the place, and never leave, life is dull but comfortable. Meanwhile, people in the wasteland outside are free but have to contend with raiders, mutants and fascist militias trying to kill them at every turn.
</li><li> The vaults in general were advertised as this in the event of a nuclear apocalypse, however in reality most of them were designed as experiments and the majority who entered them often suffered rather unfortunate ends.

Shepard's even given an upper deck for use as his/her private quarters, complete with a king-sized bed, an office space, an en-suite bathroom, a massive fishtank, and a display case for model ships. In spite of all these benefits, it's still a gilded cage: the entire ship has been bugged and most of the crew are loyal Cerberus operatives, so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Illusive Man</a> is notified of whatever happens on-board; in spite of all the leeway Shepard is given, s/he's still firmly under the Illusive Man's thumb for most of the game.

However, Elizabeth is completely unaware that there's a huge scientific facility built around her chambers, and a team of amoral researchers keeps her under almost constant surveillance via a series of one-way mirrors.

And this is actually a game mechanic - Rogue Servitors house any non-robotic species in "Organic Sanctuary" structures, and the greater the ratio of these "bio-trophies" to robots, the happier and more productive those robots are.

Also, some spy-defectors were also confined to mansions (at least in the UK, maybe the US as well) while the genuine-ness of their defection was being determined.
<ul><li> This was also done to high-ranking German officers who'd been captured. After their initial interrogation they'd be kept with fellow officers in a mansion with waiters and other amenities, unaware that this was simply to get their guard down as all their conversations were being taped.
</li><li> Field Marshal Paulus of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Wehrmacht</a> was put into one of these when he surrendered to the Soviet Union. The other German POWs? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">Not so much</a>.
</li><li> In the U.S., the Geneva convention was followed to the letter. In exchange for not escaping, Wehrmacht officers were put in luxurious accommodations as afforded for their rank, with one camp even being nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">"the Fritz Ritz"</a>, after the luxury hotel chain. Enlisted personnel were allowed free classes if they wanted, allowed to play sports within the camps, and paid a reasonable wage if they worked, under heavy guard, outside the P.O.W. camps. Ironically, the food served in these camps is said to have been of much better quality than that given to G.I.s'. In camps within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeepSouth">The Deep South</a></em>, German prisoners could visit, with strict supervision, businesses that were labeled "whites only."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Epsilon">Farm Hall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a British country manor used to house captured German nuclear physicists. The place was heavily bugged, and conversations were monitored and transcribed to determine the progress of the German nuclear program (which turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">very little</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> first became the prisoner of her cousin Elizabeth, she was kept in one of these. The later portion of her prison term was spent in a considerably less gilded cage.
</li><li> Sun King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> of France's Versailles was like this, as a very comfortable prison for a few months of the year for all the nobles, including plays specifically written for them by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere">Molière</a> and Goldoni, more than 1,400 fountains, and more.
<ul><li> The living spaces were infamously small for the grand majority of them, however, and the quality of the lavatories was abhorrent. Most of the fancy courtiers lived in rooms that made the modern student boxes seem huge, and shared the lousy toilets with dozens of their fellows.
</li></ul></li><li> The Doge ("Duke" in the Venetian dialect) of Venice was rarely allowed to leave the lavish Palazzo Ducale. The nobles were keen on maintaining executive power and preventing the establishment of a hereditary monarchy (something which was repeatedly attempted in the 8th century). The real power resided with the Council of Ten, a body which was technically reserved for times of crisis, but in the end were the biggest decision-makers in the entire republic from the 13th century up to the destruction of the republic at the hands of Napoleon.
</li><li> Despite its sinister reputation, the pre-Revolutionary Bastille largely fit this trope. It mostly housed political prisoners, and mentally ill nobles, and it was perfectly possible for a prisoner from the Bastille to get out and rise to a prestigious position in the court again, so the wardens knew well enough not to antagonize any of them. The prisoners got good food and decent wine, received an allowance, as well as anything their families donated them, and could use the money to buy anything they wanted from shops within the fortress that had as good a selection as in Paris outside. In fact, the only thing of which the prisoners were deprived was dessert with their meals and they accepted that, as prisoners, they had to be deprived of <em>something</em> to remind them that they were being punished. It was also quite a sizable building for its usual population of 20-50 detainees.
</li><li> Minimum security prisons are sort of like being on house arrest at a resort, except you're required to do community service and the like. Granted, the people who go here tend to be white collar offenders.
</li><li> In the minds of Western Orientalists Ottoman harems were this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">not so much in real life</a>. Life in a Turkish harem tended to be monastic in nature, and only a few residents were actually expected to have sexual encounters with the Sultan, while others lived in perfect chastity. The few high-ranking members of the harem, who usually included the Sultan's mother (<em>Valide Sultan</em>) and her handmaidens, did live a life of luxury, but they were hardly confined in the way Orientalists imagined, either — a great many Sultans found themselves ruling under their mother's strict thumb.
<ul><li> The average expected lifespan of a new concubine was five years. The harem was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">true snake pit</a> with the various concubines plotting against each other and against their children whilst competing of the favour of the Sultan, and eunuchs were used to execute or assassinate too ambitious concubines. A favoured way to get rid of an undesired concubine was to stuff her in a bag and throw her to sea. Sometimes an unwanted concubine could be given to a sultan's favourite - but that involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">making her infertile</a> by inserting a red-hot poker in her vagina, destroying her womb (and making her incapable of producing competitors to the throne).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafes">kafes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> of the later Ottoman Turkey. While the early Sultans resolved the inheritance issues by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">simply murdering, assassinating or executing all brothers and half-brothers</a>, this left the Osmanli family line on the verge of extinction several times. The later Sultans resolved the problem by locking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">brothers</a> to a confined part of the Palace. Some inmates of the Kafes grew old and died there before having the opportunity to succeed to the throne. Confinement in the Kafes had a great impact on the personalities of the captives in the Kafes and many of them developed psychological disorders. At least one deposed sultan and one heir to the throne committed suicide in the Kafes. The last Ottoman sultan, Mehmet VI Vahidettin (191822) was aged 56 when he came to the throne and had been either in the harem or the Kafes his whole life. He was confined to the Kafes by his uncle (Abdülaziz) and had stayed there during the reigns of his three older brothers. It was the longest and last confinement of a sultan by his predecessors.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Islands">Prince Islands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> outside Constantinople (Istanbul) served the same purpose - a gilded cage for the princes.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the guiding philosophy of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1986002,00.html">Norway's prison system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — treat inmates well, with a plush environment, in order to rehabilitate them and reduce recidivism rates.
</li><li> In the Soviet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">Gulag</a>, there were special prisons known as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharashka">sharashki,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> where inmates, usually those with some talent useful to the state like scientists or engineers, were given comfortable accommodations and high-quality food, allowed to wear their own clothing, and given a good deal of autonomy in return for working on science projects like the early space program <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev#Imprisonment">(Sergei "The Chief Designer" Korolev began his career in one.)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> After Napoleon's first defeat, he was exiled in the island of Elba, where he was given sovereignty over the island and had his own personal guard of six hundred men. The island was guarded by the British Navy, but that didn't stop him from escaping.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethBathory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethBathory">Elizabeth Báthory</a> was sentenced to a lifetime of house arrest for the many heinous crimes she committed against the peasants of her country and the surrounding countries, only being allowed company long enough to have food and drink delivered. Even though the bit about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">bathing in blood</a> is probably myth, it's certain she was vain, so leaving her alive to grow old and ugly without allowing anyone to see her while she was still youthful may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">A Fate Worse Than Death</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, the practice of exchanging hostages throughout history generally involves treating them very comfortably, though they were still prisoners that their captors could execute at any time should the other party break the deals with them.
</li><li> Similar to the Bastille example, the Tower of London was used as a prison at various points in its history, but it was originally built and used as a royal residence and fortress, and when it was used for prisoners, it was almost always for nobles or other high-ranking persons. As such, the accommodations were generally typical of what a nobleman could expect outside the tower, and a prisoner could buy various luxuries. Of course, some prisoners were subject to torture while there, so it wasn't that gilded.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> sometimes turn their homes into this, belittling their children into believing that they cannot survive outside the home, or bribing them with gifts so they feel guilty if they complain or want to move out.
</li><li> First Lady Michelle Obama, after moving into the White House, claimed that "The White House is like a prison. Though it's a really nice prison."
<ul><li> And she wasn't the first First Lady to voice that: Martha Washington noted that she and George felt like "children out of school" after his presidency was over and it was before the White House was completely built.
</li></ul></li><li> Brazilian former Judge Nicolau dos Santos Neto, who was arrested and convicted for embezzling funds from the building of a courtroom, is occasionally transferred from prison to house arrest on the pretense of treating a depression case.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GalileoGalilei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GalileoGalilei">Galileo Galilei</a> chose to illegally publish his work rather than frame it as a theory (The Church refused to make his solar-centric universe part of her dogma), he was put on house arrest. Fortunately, his line of work didn't require leaving the house at all, and they didn't take away his telescope, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">he just went on doing the exact same thing he was doing before.</a> Whoops?
</li><li> In Japan this was enforced during the reign of the Tokugawa Shogunate with the <em>sankin-kōtai</em>, or "alternate attendance" system. The regional daimyo (and a host of their warriors and servants) were required to spend every other year or so in the capital of Edo, where they would lounge about in luxurious estates and socialize with other feudal lords, but otherwise couldn't leave the city. This served numerous purposes: the regular processions to and from the capital required the construction and maintenance of roads that also facilitated trade, culture and innovations got spread throughout the country, the cost of these trips and the capital residences kept the daimyo too poor to cause trouble, and their time in the capital made it easy for the shogun to keep an eye on them - especially since their wives and heirs were kept there permanently as hostages.
</li><li> What being a foreign tourist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> (if you could even do so thanks to strict travel guidelines) entails to. As you are taken on a strict path that consists of only the capital city of Pyongyang, you are constantly supervised and only left alone in a hotel only made for foreigners, even at said hotel you are not allowed to leave, and you are only shown what is heavily staged to you to show that North Korea is a socialist paradise compared to capitalist wastelands while you are being shielded from images of poverty and famine.
