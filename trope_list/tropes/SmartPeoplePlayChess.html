A variation is having a pair of idiots play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Checkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Checkers">draughts</a> with a chess set.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Other strategy games</a> can be substituted depending on the setting (for example, Japanese media generally show cerebral types playing Go, whereas more "hand-on" characters will play Shogi). To make it easier for the audience to identify with this trope, these games will be shown as very similar to chess, either by visual cues (checkerboard designs, chess-like pieces) or described outright as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariantChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariantChess">&lt;X&gt;-chess</a>" (Wizard chess, Vulcan chess, etc.).

</p><p>This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to a degree, as the game relies heavily on strategy and forethought, so it tends to attract people who like an intellectual challenge. However, this is hardly a determiner, because as in most games, one's skill at it comes mostly from training and experience instead of raw natural intelligence. In fact, the sheer amount of concentration required could make it difficult for the highest of IQs if they happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">have focus problems</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">are not invested enough in the game</a>.

Needless to say, he is the second smartest person in the entire world of the series. <em>The</em> smartest guy in the world is a brilliant chess player, too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Don't look too closely at how they play, though; it's been outright admitted that the people who made the show at best only have a cursory knowledge of how the game works (enough to get the pieces right and that's about it).</a>
<ul><li> Usually the details of the gameplay are left in the background, but when they're not, well...in one game, Lelouch's opponent moves his king onto a square adjacent to Lelouch's king (an illegal move, since you can't move your king into check), and thus <em>declares checkmate</em> even though he doesn't think he has won. He did this to goad Lelouch into taking his king with his <em>own</em> king, but Lelouch doesn't do it because a pawn is guarding the enemy king; the nonsensical things here are too numerous to enumerate.
<ul><li> The nonsense of the move was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Odysseus, who rolls his eyes and says "Oh come on. That's just too much of a farce!"

Gozaburo, on the other hand, was a Grandmaster, and not all-too smart at all. When he later confronts Kaiba at Duel Monsters, few fans would deny that his deck strategy was very poor.
<ul><li> In the manga version, Mokuba claims that he cheated. Still, that's hardly a reason to say Seto isn't smarter than Gozuburo. (Gozaburo based his whole life on cheating and lying; Seto was likely just better at it.)
</li><li> The above is in of itself strange since there isn't a conventional way to cheat at chess. In the English dub, Seto beat Gozaburo by studying all of Gozaburo's past matches and moves, allowing him to know the best way to defeat him. While Gozaburo did adopt Seto and Mokuba as agreed, Seto's planning and execution of moves impressed Gozaburo to where he made Seto his heir to the Kaiba Corporation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, a heated match ended in 1 win for Mustang, 97 losses to Grumman, and 15 draws.

<ul><li> Lord Vetinari has an elegant Thud board in his main viewing room, and plays it remotely with a friend in Uberwald.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>, the Thud board is also used to contrast Reacher Gilt and Lord Vetinari's ways of thinking, as well as Crispin Horsefry's ignorance.
</li><li> The Assassin's Guild are also said to play "Stealth Chess", a chess variant with an additional "assassin" piece. Vetinari is a grandmaster of this game.
</li><li> Lord Hong from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em> measures the intelligence and tactical minds of his colleagues and rivals by what exceedingly long length of time they'd spend analyzing a chess board before making their move. He gives Vetinari a rather high honor by suspecting the time between moves would last for days. Whether intentional or not, this is brought up again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>. While discussing a communications breakdown, Vetinari mentions that in a way he's pleased by it, as it gives him a few more days to consider his next move in the aforementioned long-distance Thud game.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Samuel Vimes</a> can't <em>stand</em> chess; he doesn't understand why the pawns don't team up with the rooks, overthrow the kings and set up a republic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">much like</a> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingslayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingslayer">famous and reviled ancestor, Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes</a>.

</li><li> A running joke is that Death hates playing chess because he can never remember how the 'little horse-shaped one' moves. It doesn't matter anyway, given Death never loses a game unless he wants to.
</li><li> Granny Weatherwax, one of the smartest people in the series, also stated she can't stand chess; when she finds herself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath">Chess with Death</a> situation they both quickly agree to play cards instead.

As for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Colon and Nobby</a>, they did terribly. (Although this might not be <em>entirely</em> because they're stupid; at one point Colon freaks out trying to think of a word he can use that <em>doesn't</em> give him a higher score than Vetinari.)

Joram MacRorie and Rhys Thuryn are playing it when the short story "Catalyst" begins, and young Alaric Morgan gets a set as a gift. Both Alaric and Joram excel at such tactical games.
</li><li> Generally subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books. In Wizarding Chess, strategic mastery knowledge of Chess is generally less imporatant than gaining the loyalty of your sentient chess pieces such that they'll actually do what you tell them.
<ul><li> Ron is noted as being notably skilled at chess despite not being particularly bright otherwise. In the first book he successfully beats a magically powered sentient chess set, set up by one of the Hogwarts professers, in what Dumbledore describes as "the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in years." Outside his chess competence Ron is an average to below average student, despite fans often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalDumbass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalDumbass">viewing him as a complete idiot.</a>
</li><li> Hermione is by far the most intelligent of the group, but is not very good at chess and doesn't like the concept of it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBlood">Dragon Blood</a></em>, the imprisoned prince Kellen plays chess with his visitors. The fact makes it clear to the reader that Kellen does not belong into the insane asylum that, ironically enough, was built specially to imprison him, by his brother, the king.
</li><li> Played with in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModestyBlaise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModestyBlaise">Modesty Blaise</a> novel <em>The Night of Morningstar</em>. The evil mastermind Golitsyn is shown playing chess while waiting for news on the outcome of a mission — and playing dirty, distracting his opponent with insults while he makes a key move, because he's not confident of winning fairly and has too much ego to accept losing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFinalReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFinalReflection">The Final Reflection</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord">John M. Ford</a>, reveals that Klingon military strategy is the province of military "thought admirals", who hone their skills in <em>klin zha</em> (Klingon chess). The (Klingon) protagonist's father, who is a thought admiral, also studies other races' equivalents of <em>klin zha</em>, including the Human game "chess", to gain insight into the races that play them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheBraveAndTheBold">Star Trek: The Brave and the Bold</a></em>, Captain Robert Desoto of the <em>Hood</em>, Riker's former commanding officer, is a champion-level Go player. His reputation is such that he could never find anyone to play him, so he resorted to teaching some of his naive staff the game...including Riker, a "brash young lieutenant who didn't like games where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">couldn't bluff</a>", and his current first officer, which he regretted as she went from the standard handicap to regularly <em>beating</em> him inside of a year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyEnemyMyAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyEnemyMyAlly">My Enemy, My Ally</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a>, introduces the idea of <em>four-dimensional</em> chess. The board is cube-shaped (the pieces are controlled by a special transporter system to keep them from falling off) and players can remove a piece entirely to use it later. They may later change when a piece reappears, although every time a player does that, the other player gets to make an extra move. At the beginning of the book, Kirk is about to lose to Spock. Bones takes over for Kirk and beats Spock. Kirk was in a bad way because he tried one of his "scream-and-leap" offensives, which occasionally succeeds in rattling Spock with its sheer bloody-minded enthusiasm, but Spock wasn't falling for it this time. Kirk is smart, but unless he can nab a psychological advantage over Spock early in the game, he'll lose more often than not. But the real crowner here goes to the Romulan Commander Ael t'Rllaillieu, who soundly beats McCoy at a round of 4D chess. . . <em>minutes after learning of the existence of any form of chess</em>.

(Although he's never seen playing an actual game because that would presuppose that he had friends to play with.)
</li><li> Sort of played with in the first of Jacques Futrelle's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThinkingMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThinkingMachine">The Thinking Machine</a></em> mysteries. The title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective">Great Detective</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, has never played chess before and doesn't have a high opinion of it. He learns the basic rules of the game, then applies his intelligence to defeat a chess grandmaster on his first try. Of course, his brainpower includes, as the rest of his adventures show, Sagan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> for chess of "strategy, foresight, analytical powers, and the ability to cross-correlate large numbers of variables and learn from experience".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> novel <em>Liberty's Crusade</em> shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Arcturus Mengsk</a> as an avid chess player, complete with a chess set in his command center.

Tabori is very interested in playing, exclaiming audibly about lessons he learned, and Takagishi, who is a master player, secures himself and advantage at the beginning of every game, then allows Tabori to erode it out of consideration for his friend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bella classified Eric as a "chess nerd". This is frustrating for anti-fans, because a) Bella is judging Eric by his looks, and b) never, at any point in the series, do we see Eric playing chess.
</li><li> Alice and Edward play chess together, because, you know, Edward being a telepath, another psychic is the only opponent who can give him a good game.
</li></ul></li><li> Lord Loss, from Darren Shan's <em>The Demonata</em> series, is exceptionally intelligent and very manipulative. Chess is his second favourite pastime (after torturing humans)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em> book has Forrest learning to play chess rather well, going up against various masters of the game.
</li><li> Smart people play Chess is a frequently recurring motif in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s work, usually taking one of two forms: a four-year-old child playing chess against adults, or two characters passing the time in a stressful situation by playing without a board. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixthColumn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixthColumn">Sixth Column</a></em>, Major Aardmore shows his superiority over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by offering the solution to a chess problem. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> can't figure out how it works; months later, after his defeat, he asks Aardmore about it. Aardmore admits that he had no solution and was simply bluffing. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> either kills himself in disgrace or dies of apoplexy or frustration; it's not clear which.

At first, all we know is that Theo's opponent is sneaky, not necessarily smart. However, an eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> move by Theo's opponent reveals to Judge Ford that the other player is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the brilliant Sam Westing, who isn't dead after all</span> because she's seen that same tactic before. Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grown-up Turtle</span> beats Theo's opponent in a chess game, which makes sense because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she turned out to be the only one smart enough to solve the Westing Game as well</span>.
</li><li> Cluny the Scourge, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>, makes a vow to himself to learn to play chess while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> is falling into place, going by the logic that since his real-life tactics work so well he'll be unbeatable. He never does get the chance to try, though.
</li><li> Several really smart characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> are fond of the chesslike game <em>ludus</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Tavi</a> learned to play from Ambassador Varg (one of several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> types), and also plays against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">Nasaug</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">in the middle of a battle between their armies</a>. Tavi even later includes beating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nasuag</span> at Ludus in extended boast about his seemingly impossible successes and victories.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Market Forces</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardMorgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardMorgan">Richard Morgan</a>, a 2004 sci-fi novel in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> types battle for promotion by fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a>-style road duels. The protagonist Chris Faulkner has been manipulated into a fatal road duel with his friend Mike Bryant (a more skilled driver) in order to eliminate them both as potential rivals. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">Just Between You and Me</a> moment, the antagonist derides Faulkner and Bryant's chess hobby, pointing out that its restricted field and strict rules make the game useless training for real life.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Peacebreakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Peacebreakers">Peacebreakers</a></em> by Mindy Mackay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Isabella Sordeno</a> is shown playing chess, as is her brother and two of her minions.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHSchmitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHSchmitz">James H. Schmitz</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TelzeyAmberdon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TelzeyAmberdon">Telzey Amberdon</a> is a superpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> telepath, introduced in one story, playing in the planetary championship games.
</li><li> In Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Empire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Empire">Empire</a></em> trilogy, characters who are good at chess are inevitably good tacticians, especially the lords of House Anasati, and their utterly unbeatable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> genius advisor.
</li><li> "Stones" (a fictional game that bears a resemblance to the Chinese board game Go) fulfills this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>. Morgase Trakan, Pedron Niall, and Thom Merillin are all master Stones players and excellent strategists and politicians, and often make observations about other characters based on their ability at the game. Matrim Cauthon is a strategic whizz and rather a good Stones player, but too impatient to beat the best players. The villainous Moridin is described at a master not just of Stones but of every game of skill he's ever bothered to learn and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster">Chess Master</a> that he is, tends to visualize his entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> as a vast boardgame where he controls all the pieces on both sides.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goddaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goddaughter">The Goddaughter Duet</a></em>, not only does Daphne Whitford play chess, when she's informed that George liked chess already, Daphne upgraded it to <em>speed</em> chess.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a>'s covers was a chess prodigy. The guard, also a chessmaster (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">that kind</a>), didn't believe it and challenged him to a game. Artemis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">beat him in six moves</a>.

</li><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> novels have a drow variant of chess called sava, where there is an extra component: a pair of dice. A player can opt to not move their own pieces in favor of rolling the dice. If they get a double spider, they can move one of their <em>opponent's</em> pieces. This is supposed to represent the drow tendency for treachery.

Reynard wins most of the time, in spite of Isengrim having played since childhood. As Reynard himself points out, this is because Isengrim tries to defend everything, and ends up defending nothing, while Reynard is willing to sacrifice his pieces for the ultimate victory . . .

Good players include the extremely clever Tyrion Lannister, the scholar Haldon Halfmaester, the quite intelligent princess Myrcella, and the good tactician Brown Ben Plumm. Doran Martell is a subversion; he never plays any game he could potentially lose.

</li><li> Characters in K. J. Parker novels are usually very intelligent and this tends to entail being skilled chess players as well:
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoldingKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoldingKnife">The Folding Knife</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> protagonist Basso is a very skilled chess player, so good in fact that after his wife notices he's letting her win, he challenges himself to lose on purpose in a way that obscures this.

One person brought into Wolfe's office is uncomfortable confiding in him without having first played a chess game with him. Wolfe (who does not enjoy chess) responds, "Very well. I have no board or pieces." Only a few moves later, his opponent notes Wolfe's last move was commonly known as inferior to a specific alternative... and is then forced to agree with Wolfe that unlike the conventional play he'd of course rehearsed the counter to, he can no longer keep track of the game in his head and concedes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse">Second Apocalypse</a></em> subverts this trope with benjuka, a board game where the rules change after every move, much like life, creating a game of baffling complexity and poetic subtlety. In contrast to games with fixed rules, it cannot be intellectually mastered. It is said to challenge one's spirit rather than intellect. As such, the highly intelligent Achamian usually loses to his regular game partner because he stubbornly tries to force a victory through sheer cunning.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon">Sidney Sheldon</a>'s book <em>If Tomorrow Comes</em> the con-woman protagonist outsmarts two rival chess grandmasters by betting (and getting very high odds) that if she plays them both simultaneously she can either beat one of them or force them both to a draw. What she does is repeat each player's previous move so that they are actually playing each other, but they don't realise because they are in different rooms.

He gains respect for Lady Barbara when she proves to be an excellent player, and it's another mark in favor of the Comte de Gracy and his daughter-in-law Marie. Bush is <em>not</em> very good at it because he's not mathematical or especially imaginative in spite of his expertise at seamanship. Nor is the bullying Jack Simpson, who completely bungles a game with Hornblower and accuses him of cheating in one of the <em>Midshipman</em> stories.

He teaches his also quite smart ward and protege Rafe Sadler, and early on they lament that they need to find other opponents because they know each other's game so well they always wind up in stalemates. Cromwell also pulls off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCheckmate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCheckmate">Surprise Checkmate</a> against Tom Seymour, although Seymour isn't as intelligent as Cromwell is.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a>,</em> where Harry Dresden mentions that his preferred method of judging a being's intelligence is to play a game of <em><strong>checkers</strong></em> with them.

Him playing the strategic game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TollTheHounds">Toll the Hounds</a></em> is the first hint the reader gets that Spinnock is not just dumb muscle.
</li><li> <em>Between Silk and Cyanide</em>. SOE agent Violette Szabo gives Leo Marks a chess set she'd won in a shooting competition, under the wrongful assumption that as a codebreaker he must play chess. Marks later informs Szabo that he's never lost a game on her chess set, not mentioning that he's never used the set at all.

He ends up beating all but one. The last one, he gets over-excited and makes a mistake, losing his advantage. The opponent immediately offers him a tie, and Elektronic accepts.

</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClublandHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClublandHeroes">Clubland Heroes</a>", the child genius boasts, "Do you play chess? I can beat anyone, without looking at the board." It's not put to the test, though, because the last thing the protagonist wants is a reason to spend more time in his company.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Middlegame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Middlegame">Middlegame</a></em>: Dodger is a genius who both publishes prizewinning mathematical proofs and does a tour as a competitive chess champion before her teens.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseOfKyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseOfKyoshi">The Rise of Kyoshi</a></em>: Most of the movers and shakers of the world play pai sho, and skill in the game is often equated to political acumen, with Avatar Kuruk's friend, Jianzhu, being both a skilled player apt to think in pai sho metaphors while he keeps thinking up and laying down a series of desperate plays to keep hold on the power he's accumulated since Kuruk's death, which is threatened by Kyoshi's refusal to be subjected to his authority after she watched him kill two of the people she loves most. Avatar Kuruk himself was an avid player, which is constantly drawn attention to as the game is supposedly the one thing he took seriously. This turns out to be foreshadowing for the reveal that Kuruk, while still the fun-loving, 'go-with-flow' Avatar he describes himself as in the series, was actually a very intelligent, dedicated hunter of dark spirits who threatened to endanger the humans in the material world, and he was shielding his friends from this knowledge to prevent them from damaging their own spirits by joining him in these incredibly draining fights. It's his friends, Jianzhu and Kelsang, who end up identifying Yun as Kuruk's reincarnation based on the fact that they watched him execute all of the intricate plays that Kuruk thought up and only ever confided to them, and Yun is constantly lauded as being a much better diplomat and politician the distracted Kuruk was. Meanwhile, Kyoshi, Kuruk's actual reincarnation, does <em>not</em> play pai sho, and this demonstrates her complete lack of political skill. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOfKyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOfKyoshi">the sequel</a>, she's rather annoyed that everyone is constantly asking her if she plays.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Spock would often play 3-D chess when off duty (usually against Captain Kirk). One episode has Spock discovering that the ship's computer was tampered with when he managed to beat it at the game several times in a row. (Spock's reasoning was that because <em>he</em> was the one who programmed the computer to play chess, it would be unlikely that he could manage anything better than a stalemate while playing against it.)
</li><li> Subverted in the 1st season episode "The Corbomite Maneuver", which has Spock making chess references left and right, trying to use it as an analogue for the situation the ship finds itself in. Kirk eventually realizes that the best game analogue should actually be poker, and proceeds to bluff the alien ship about what would happen if he fired on the Enterprise. The alien buys it (or is at least intrigued enough by the bluff to play along).
</li><li> In "Whom Gods Destroy" Kirk orders the bridge to present a chess problem to anyone - himself included - who desires to be let onboard, and to not let the individual onboard unless he states the correct counter-move, which only he, Scotty and Spock know. (This proves clever foresight on his part, as the villain of the episode does indeed try to board the ship disguised as him.)
</li><li> Used in a fairly ridiculous way in the second pilot. Kirk defeats Spock by using an "illogical" tactic which catches him off guard. What makes it silly is that the tactic is simply sacrificing a piece, which leads to checkmate in the next turn. How this very basic part of the game is illogical is never explained.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first of episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scorpion">Scorpion</a></em>, the team realize that Ralph is a budding genius when he beats Sylvester, a chess Grand Master; by the time Paige is alerted to what's going on, Ralph has Sylvester in checkmate in eight moves. <em>Using sugar packets on a non-checkerboard counter top.</em>
<ul><li> Mark Collins is also mentioned to be good at chess, but not so much because of being good at playing the game as because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">he's good at mind games and forcing people into playing badly</a>.

</li><li> In another episode, Troi beats Data at 3-D chess. (To anyone who understands chess strategy or game theory, this scene (mentioned in more detail on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Straw Vulcan</a> page) takes clear artistic liberties, as Troi extols the virtues of "intuition" in a game that is fundamentally brutally mathematical, and at which Data would likely have an unfair advantage, but it's also a nod to the original series which used the excuse that Kirk was capable of defeating Spock at chess precisely because of emotional illogic rather than strategy and mathematics.)
</li><li> In yet another episode, Barclay gains super-intelligence from an alien probe. When this is reversed at the end of the episode, Barclay discovers that he has retained the ability to play chess as a residual effect.
<ul><li> Or else he has discovered a sense of humour and social confidence he lacked before, and announces a long-range checkmate in someone else's game simply for the amusement of watching them react as if he were still a super-genius. It is never established whether he was <em>right</em> or merely bluffing.
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically, the game of choice for the Enterprise-D's crew is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a>, which requires a different sort of strategy based on statistical analysis and, frequently, cold reading. Even more ironic is that Troi doesn't seem to have any advantage at <em>this</em> game even though intuition would make much more of a difference (and her superpower). At the beginning of the series, Data had little understanding of the various subtleties involved in poker (Riker had to outright explain what a bluff actually was). However, as the series progressed, Data gained an understanding of the game, and used the fact that he didn't have emotions to create the <em>perfect</em> poker face.
<ul><li> It could very well be the case however that Troi simply refrains from using her empathic abilities during poker because she feels that doing so would constitute cheating. Likewise, the crew trusts Geordi to not use his visor to cheat, and Data to not count cards (Data having cheated at gambling, poker included, several times in the series to get the crew out of a jam). Whatever the case, somehow Riker often manages to win. Worf also does surprisingly well, especially considering his boast that "Klingons never bluff."

It was played by Tuvok, Harry Kim, Icheb, and simulations of Socrates and T'Pau. Harry once called it "Vulcan chess", a comment which Tuvok dismissed, claiming that "Kal-toh is to chess as chess is to tic-tac-toe."

</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "Superstar", Jonathan has made a spell to turn himself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHoleSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHoleSue">Black Hole Sue</a>. One of the first things we see the new suave Jonathan doing is beating Giles at chess while simultaneously teaching slaying strategy to the rest of the Scoobies.
</li><li> Chessboards appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, though they are rarely prominent in the plot. Topher, the Los Angeles Dollhouse's resident programmer and genius, usually has a board in his office, and has an improvised, chalk-drawn one beside the sleeping pod where he holes up after losing his mind in the dystopia of "Epitaph One." Also, "Getting Closer" includes a scene in which Bennett and Echo while away the hours with chess while repairing the hard drive containing Echo's original personality, Caroline. (Though the real Caroline was smart but no genius, Echo — thanks to the repeated personality imprints on her brain — by then has 40 minds to draw upon and might well be a match at chess for Bennett <em>or</em> Topher.)
<ul><li> In the unaired pilot, Topher is shown playing chess on three different boards (against himself, presumably).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, President Bartlet plays chess. At one point he plays several games simultaneously while solving a crisis related to Taiwan. When Leo insists that Charlie organize a weekly chess match for the President, Charlie assumes it's just a way to unwind, and can be assigned a low priority. Leo points out, with deadly seriousness, that it's a way to make sure his multiple sclerosis isn't starting to impact his cognitive functions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em>, faced with a choice between a game of chess or Buckaroo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">manchild</a> Dougal predictably goes with the less cerebral option, prompting Ted to roll his eyes and say "Buckaroo: the sport of kings."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, the highly-advanced AI Holly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IQTesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IQTesting">with an official IQ of 6000</a>, plays chess — but not very well. (Although the only time we've actually seen the outcome of one of his games, it subsequently turned out that he'd been playing to lose, and against himself.)
<ul><li> Before the 3 million year narrative jump, Holly was playing chess by correspondence with a computer named Gordon, who had an IQ of 8000. In "Better Than Life", the crew intercepts a load of mail from 3 million years ago, which includes a video of Gordon declaring the first move, then having trouble turning off the recording device.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1995">The Outer Limits (1995)</a></em> episode "I, Robot", Leonard Nimoy's character, a retired lawyer, plays chess a lot. He comes out of retirement because it bores him.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CheersS5E15" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CheersS5E15">Spellbound</a>". Frasier the egghead plays resident numbskull Woody at chess, and Woody beats him every time. Frasier suggests that he is an <em>idiot savant</em> (although Woody does not know what that means).
</li><li> Similarly, the cold open of an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings">Wings</a></em> comes upon Lowell and Roy in the middle of a game. When a frustrated Roy demands that Lowell make a move, as they've been sitting there for 30 minutes, a confused Lowell says, "I thought it was <em>your</em> turn!". An even more annoyed Roy snaps at him to move. . .and sure enough, Lowell instantly checkmates him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> episode "Chess Pains", Frasier invites Martin to play him at chess. Since his father's far less educated and erudite than him, he expects little challenge, and becomes frustrated when he can't win a single match. Martin points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">thirty years as a cop</a> taught him a few things about strategy. Frasier being Frasier, he diagnoses himself with previously-unnoticed daddy issues causing him to subconsciously throw the game rather than admit Martin's better than him (although given his near-breakdown when he actually wins one he may have had something of a point).
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> has a prodigy chess player as a patient who plays a game with Dr. House. He would have lost, but he bluffs House out, which results in him technically winning.
</li><li> It isn't enough that Charlie Eppes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> could multiply four-digit numbers in his head when he was three, graduated from high school and entered Princeton at 13, completed his bachelors degree in three years and is a multiple Ph.D. No, just so we'll know he's <em>really</em> smart, he regularly beats his father and his former academic advisor (both portrayed as above average intelligence) at chess, too. (But he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Not Too Perfect</a>: he doesn't do so well at Scrabble.)
</li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, Locke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unlocks a secret message</span> by beating a computer game of chess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>:
<ul><li> They do this doubly so in one scene; Artie is pondering over a game of chess with himself and says that it's White's move and White's about to lose, while Lena tells him that Claudia's not such a bad kid. Claudia then walks by, moves a piece, announces checkmate, and walks off.
<div class="indent"><strong>Artie (astounded):</strong> "I'll be damned."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Claudia:</strong> "Well, maybe, but I'm not one to judge."
</div></li><li> And then averted/subverted in a later episode: Artie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot">trapped in the warehouse by an advanced A.I. program</a>. He challenges the A.I. to a game of...Battleship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Artie wins, by cheating, which ends up being key to figuring out what's going on in the episode.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A different version of this trope is seen with war games (the kind played on a board). Two examples include a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> movie in which the killer used the playing of the game as an alibi (he'd actually set up the game hours beforehand) and an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEqualizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEqualizer">The Equalizer</a></em> where a former general set up a complicated revenge against McCall's client. In both examples the villain becomes unstuck due to the game — the misplacement of a single soldier exposes the false alibi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em>. The general, once his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> has failed, plans to kill the Equalizer and his client with the cannons (rigged to fire poisoned darts) on his model of Pickett's Charge. Only a single cannon fires though — at the general, as McCall has got at the model beforehand. The dying general is impressed, and concedes the game to his opponent. For the record, Columbo himself seems to subvert the trope; he's a mastermind police detective who hides his genius under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> facade, and yet he seems to prefer checkers. In the episode in question, while the killer and victim were antagonizing each other over chess pieces, we soon cut to Columbo and his dentist heavily engrossed in a checkers game.
</li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> episode "Make it Happen", the Russo's kids have to choose an alternate career in the case of they don't become wizards. Justin's first idea is to make money by travelling the world defeating robots at chess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> frequently depicts Neal and Mozzie playing chess. An oddly organized pursuit for anarchistic Mozz.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>:
<ul><li> Crichton plays the game against Harvey (the neural clone in his head). They appeared to be relatively evenly matched, with the outcome being appropriate to the larger situation they were in.
</li><li> Sikozu also once brought the game to Scorpius (whose intelligence was the only one on board she saw as on par to her own) so they could play.
</li></ul></li><li> Occasionally pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Eleventh Doctor claimed that chess was originally a Time Lord game.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor would often be seen playing chess against his robot dog K-9. And would often lose.
</li><li> As fitting the Seventh Doctor's status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>, this would pop up from time to time in his era. He's participating in a chess game against an unseen opponent in "Silver Nemesis", and the climax of "The Curse of Fenric" hinges on whether the Doctor is able to flummox his opponent with a chess puzzle.
</li><li> Eleven is seen playing an agent of the Silence at 'Live Chess', a variant where moving a piece too many times causes it to give an electric shock to the player if touched. He forces his opponent to continually move his queen until the shock the piece harbors is lethal, then concedes the game, sparing his opponent from death, in exchange for information.
</li><li> Eleven challenges the Cyber-Planner "Mr. Clever" to a game of chess in "Nightmare in Silver", with the stakes being that whoever wins takes control of the Doctor's body. They both cheat.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor finds the immortal Ashildr/Me waiting for him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastManHeardAKnock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastManHeardAKnock">at the death of the Universe</a>, having taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a>. She has a second chair and a chess table set up (though neither get used). According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, having lived longer than even the Doctor, Me has long since surpassed him in knowledge and wisdom.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em>. A flashback scene shows Sarah Connor entering a South American guerilla camp; sitting in a jungle clearing is her son playing chess with their commander.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, Samantha Carter is playing chess with Cassandra. Cassandra mentions O'Neill, and states that he's not as dumb as he pretends to be. The example she gives of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> is that he insists on calling the knight pieces "horses."
<ul><li> In a later episode, O'Neill is shown playing chess with General Landry. O'Neill wins. This makes perfect sense, given that he's a general in the Air Force with a background in special forces, and as such knows a lot about strategy.
</li></ul></li><li> One scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnAdams">John Adams</a></em> shows Benjamin Franklin playing chess... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">in a bathtub with Madame Helvétius.</a>
</li><li> On an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, D'Angelo Barksdale finds his lieutenants Poot and Bodie playing checkers with a chess set. He teaches them the rudiments of the proper game and sets it up as a brilliant extended metaphor for the Barksdale drug organization. Bodie recalls it <em>three seasons later</em>, shortly before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's killed</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, child psychic Gibson Praise is first seen playing an adult in a chess tournament. Subverted because it's not a proof of his great intelligence, but the fact that he can read minds and has alien DNA.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>, Spencer Reid is seen playing chess...against himself. Throughout the first two seasons, he and Gideon played frequently with Gideon beating Reid almost every time. Gideon claimed that to win and be a good profiler, he needed to learn to think outside the box.
<ul><li> In one episode, Prentiss recognizes that Gideon was about to checkmate Reid before he does, highlighting her intelligence.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteriousWays">Mysterious Ways</a></em> episode "The Big Picture," Declan asks Miranda (his assistant and a very intelligent physics grad student) to play chess with him. She replies that last time she beat him in nine moves.
</li><li> A non-chess example. One one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> has a cameo to answer one of Jon's questions. Someone handed him a Rubik's Cube as a prop just before he walked onto the set. He solved it <em>while answering the question</em> and dropped it on the desk before he walked off set.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/v-urVIOVJ9w?t=3m40s">Also from the Daily Show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: Trevor Noah ("because I'm white. I'll go first") played pawn to D4, and Jon Stewart ("I guess 'cos I'm Jewish, I'll go second") replied by dropping a small plastic washing basket on the pawn and shouted "Oh snap! Mousetrap! Checkmate! USA! USA!".

Maddie is smart and London is really, really dumb, yet Maddie can't beat London at chess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck">The Suite Life on Deck</a></em> had an example similar to the Zack and Cody one. After losing an arm wrestle to Bailey's redneck boyfriend, Cody suggests that he's probably not so good at more intellectual endeavors such as chess. Wrong.
</li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>, Jane plays a game of chess with one of the world's top puzzle experts. They don't bother to use a board.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>, book smart Tobias Beecher teaches street smart thug Chris Keller how to play chess; Keller has no patience for it, but goes along with it as part of his and Vern Schillinger's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>. Later, he and Schillinger are seen playing chess; it's hinted that Keller already knew how to play.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em>, Steven, tired of losing at chess to Alex, studies the game copiously and finally manages to beat him. However, Alex is out of the room when Steven checkmates him and Steven accidentally knocks over the board in celebration.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS03E01TheEmptyHearse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS03E01TheEmptyHearse">The Empty Hearse</a>" has a scene cleverly subverting this: a scene opens with Sherlock and Mycroft clearly playing chess, and they proceed to banter for an entire scene while still clearly playing chess. The end of the scene zooms the camera out, revealing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepthDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepthDeception">the chess board was on the other side of the room</a>, and they were actually playing the kid's game Operation.
</li><li> In the "Strange Fruit" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em>, a white suburban housewife is initially infuriated to find a strange black boy (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a>) in her house (mistakenly assuming that he's cavorting with the housekeeper) until she looks at the chess board she has set up and instantly realizes from the move that he made that he's a terrific player. It kicks off an very unusual friendship. . .which unfortunately sets in motion a chain of events that lead to his murder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBorgias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBorgias">The Borgias</a></em>, Cesare, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, is often seen playing chess. The trope is also played with in one episode, when a relative of Lucrezia's husband teaches her to play chess and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">doesn't seem to be that good at it</a>, but ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">outsmarting him in real life</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>.
<ul><li> When Harold Finch goes to visit Elias in prison, the only thing the city's most powerful mob boss asks for in return for his help is for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> to play chess.

</li><li> A flashback scene in another episode shows Finch teaching chess to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Machine</a>, although Finch cautions the Machine against thinking of people as chess pieces who can be casually sacrificed. The Machine spends hours pondering its first move because it's unable to make a decision when the possibilities of success are so uncertain, until Finch convinces it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">just go ahead anyway</a>.
</li><li> John Reese is shown playing <em>Xiangqi</em> in the park, a Chinese version of chess. Although he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBrawn">'brawn' part of Team Machine</a>, he's far from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>, being a former CIA assassin who worked internationally.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, this trope is used to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> for both Sheppard and Zelenka.
<ul><li> Sheppard might seem like your average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> surviving solely thanks to his charm, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablePilotingSkills">Improbable Piloting Skills</a> and sheer luck, but he's a better chess player than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">McKay</a>, the top scientist on Atlantis.

<div class="indent"><em>"See, chess doesn't prepare you for this.

<ul><li> Inverted by Norbert Wiener, inventor of Cybernetics, path integrals, and large parts of applied fourier analysis. He would often play chess but was usually beaten after making simple mistakes. On one occasion, a student who didn't know about this tendency spent ten minutes trying to work out what strategy he had thought of that would enable Wiener to checkmate him by sacrificing his queen. He asked Wiener what this was, and Wiener promptly asked to take back his previous move, not having realized he had put his queen in a position to be captured. The reason is that chess requires a lot more than mere intelligence. As the Carl Sagan quote indicates, chess requires "strategy, foresight, analytical powers, and the ability to cross-correlate large numbers of variables and learn from experience". While these traits can accompany high intelligence, they are not guaranteed. And of course, most important of all is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">skill to play chess</a>. It is estimated that it takes 15,000 hours of practice for the average person to reach expert levels in chess.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> liked to play chess and stated in an interview that it was one of the things he treasured in life.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> had a lifelong obsession with chess, saying, "If chess has any relationship to filmmaking, it would be in the way it helps you develop patience and discipline in choosing between alternatives at a time when an impulsive decision seems very attractive."

</li><li> Often partially inverted in real-life chess champions — Kasparov follows some very questionable historical theories, while Bobby Fischer was notoriously self-absorbed and ragingly anti-semitic (despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">being half-Jewish</a>) and early 20th-century chess champion Aleksandr Alekhine was a raving egomaniac with possible Nazi connections.

<ul><li> But then again, you have: Jose Capablanca, who managed to secure a Cuban diplomatic post (even if it was primarily due to his chess skills, some level of social ability is needed to both get and keep a political patronage job); Paul Morphy, a talented attorney (said to have memorized the entire Louisiana legal code) who resented being unable to start a successful law practice because of the attention drawn to his chess ability; Emanuel Lasker, who had a doctorate in mathematics, wrote works of drama and philosophy, and held the world championship for 27 years; Max Euwe, who also held a doctorate in mathematics and, before he became world champion, used mathematics to show that the rules of chess as they then stood did not preclude the possibility of neverending games; Mikhail Botvinnik, who was one of the best electrical engineers in the Soviet Union (he played a key role in developing early chess computers), in addition to being the first world champion after the second World War and winning his title back after it was taken from him by a younger opponent. Twice.

The IBM Markham and Google Mountain View break rooms for software engineers have Go boards (computers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">weren't</a> as good at Go).
</li><li> Since 2011, chess lessons have been made part of the curriculum in every public school in Armenia. Armenia is the first country in the world to make chess mandatory in schools.
</li><li> British chess champion <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conel_Hugh_O%27Donel_Alexander">Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was also a cryptanalyst who contributed to breaking the Enigma code in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring">Alan Turing</a>'s team. According to Turing's biography, He would then spend whatever free time he had hosting a free of charge, open for all beginners class in chess. That is a guy who either loved his work or hated his life.
<ul><li> Turing himself, though, was useless at chess, even though he developed an early algorithm that computers would be able to use once they became advanced enough.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently averted by Victor Serebriakoff, the late chairman of Mensa, who describes himself in <em>The Mensa Puzzle Book</em> as once defeating the captain of the Chess Club who was looking for subtleties in Idiotic Play. Elsewhere in the book he describes whist and bridge as "nasty, calculating" games, and states his preference for more lighthearted card games.
</li><li> On one of his shows, the illusionist/mentalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown">Derren Brown</a> invites a number of grandmasters, FIDE masters, and a high school student to play a simultaneous game of chess with him. He positions all of them in a circle, facing outward, with almost half of them (the number of players is odd) playing white, and the others playing black. After a long game, he ends up with the overall score of 5 wins and 4 losses, especially after claiming to be terrible at chess to the audience (to the players, he said he's decent). How did he do it? Memorization. He remembered the moves made by the whites, then replayed them as the whites on the boards opposite them, then remembered the counter-moves and repeated those on the opposite boards, effectively making the grandmasters and FIDE masters playing one another. This ensured an even result, so he only had to beat the one odd player not being mirrored, which is where the high school student (i.e. the weakest player) came in, whom he beat on his own. This, of course, pales in comparison to Derren somehow predicting the number of white pieces left on each board before the game even started.
</li><li> American Founding Father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> was an avid chess player who popularized the game in America. He wrote The Morals of Chess in 1786 and was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1999.
