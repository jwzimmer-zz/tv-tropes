In the latter, Pride is the "pride and joy" of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Father. At one point Hohenheim addresses Pride, and characterizes his self-love as particularly evil: Pride is utterly incapable of giving value to the life of any other person, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> personified. <br/><br/>Not only is Pride Father's most powerful Homunculus, and not only is Pride the most prideful and arrogant of them all, his very <em>shape</em> is proof of Father's hubris. His true form is basically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Father</em>'s original form as an amorphous shadow in a flask</span> cranked up to eleven and then some.

<ul><li> Vegeta gets his ass handed to him <em>so many</em> times during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> for his stubborn pride, you start to wonder if he likes it. Few are the characters who have done more stupid things for the sake of their pride. Like so many characters on this page though, it is all he has left if you think about it. He's the Prince of a world that no longer exists, all his kin are dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until Trunks is born</span>, and that filthy peasant Kakarot just keeps getting further ahead of him in terms of power. Of course, the whole <em>reason</em> why he has nothing else left is his pride. He killed Nappa because of it, and got Bulma despite it, yet also loses the latter because of it. Good thing for him the Dragon Balls exist, as they allow him to keep trying again until even he gets it right.
</li><li> Most of <em>DBZ</em> villains tend to have this as a major flaw thinking there is no way they can be defeated. Frieza cannot comprehend that a "monkey" could become stronger than him even after he is sliced in half and the world blows up.
</li><li> Android 17 thinks he is the perfect fighting machine and cannot be improved upon. Cell thinks his final form is "perfect" due to having the best qualities of each fighter and cannot be defeated.
</li><li> Even in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series, most villains have this fatal flaw. King Piccolo is so sure of his power that he believes that no one in the world can defeat him, even when Goku was fighting as his equal and he was sealed for centuries by a martial artist.
</li><li> Piccolo Jr, before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, also had this flaw, believing no one but Goku was a threat to him, and even then talked down to Goku and kept underestimating him.
</li><li> Goku has a more subtle case of pride, but it is still noticeable. He refuses to ask for assistance, even when he's being beating up, and doesn't really like outside help. When he was sick fighting Android 19, he refused any help and kept fighting until he was physically knocked down and had his energy sucked. His Saiyan pride also didn't allow him to eat a Senzu to restore his health, although Cell wanted him to eat one, and he didn't like that he needed help to beat Buu or to become a Super Saiyan God since it was a level he couldn't reach on his own. Several characters have actually called Goku out for being too prideful.
</li><li> Gohan has this as well, subtly: whenever he is powerful enough to overcome his opponents with ease, he lets the power get to his head. Despite being powerful enough to end the fight, he'll toy with his opponent and put them into a corner, forcing them to lash out and overcome his power, as both Cell and Super Buu can attest. In Cell's case, this turned out to be a mistake which ended up costing him his father when Cell decided to try to blow up the planet.

<ul><li> Light. Where Light's pride hurt him the most was his underestimating L's abilities. While he was a better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> than L and correctly estimated Mello and Near's <em>individual</em> abilities, several of Light's mistakes can be traced to underestimating L. First was the Lind L. Tailor incident. Then Light changed the time he wrote in the Death Note after L figured the times of death meant Kira was a student, letting L know Kira had a connection to the police. Kira had better chances of not being identified as one of many students than as a family member of the police, but simply did it just to one-up L. Then Light only waited a week after Penbar's investigation of him to kill him, thinking that the lapsed time would be long enough to cool his trail, but picked up the attention of not only L but also Misora. And there really wasn't a good reason to kill Penber at the time anyway. Then he didn't think that L would leave a way for his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">successors to know he had died</span>. Had Light recognized that the detective L was smarter than the criminal Kira, things may have gone differently. <br/><br/>Light's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a> is the most obvious example of this trope in the manga — not just his delusion of godhood, but the very fact that he thinks he has the right to kill whomever he deems fit, and whomever gets in his way. Light's pride is what ultimately proves he's Kira, as he can't help but reveal his identity in the final moment of a tough opponent's life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grinning over Penber and L and outright telling Misora he's Kira just as her sentence to suicide takes effect.</span> If he wasn't so keen on gloating, he may well have survived the final encounter with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Near</span>.

Hercules, while a good guy, has attacked people who he believes insulted him or take attention away from him.

Sooner or later it always come back to bite him.
</li><li> Sinestro has Pride as his defining character trait. The writer for the <em>Sinestro</em> series Cullen Bunn had this to say about him:
<div class="indent">"If Sinestro's motivation could be boiled down to one overriding concept, it would be pride. His pride carries him, often when nothing else will. His pride has also been his undoing from time to time. He's too proud to ever accept that his way is not the right way."

They treated less powerful people with growing contempt, levying more and more tributes on the conquered.

<ul><li> Pride is the defining trait of Lord Voldemort in . He is so in love with himself that he can't stand the idea of ceasing to be, which is what drives his obsession with immortality. He continually underestimates Harry and refuses to countenance the idea that there are powers that he doesn't understand. He repeatedly blames others for mistakes he himself makes and is incapable of viewing others as his equal, ultimately leading to his downfall.
</li><li> Other characters in the series, such as Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy and pretty much anyone with a blood prejudice, has been shown to suffer for their pride as well.
</li><li> Pride is both a virtue and fault of Harry Potter himself. What separates Potter from the other examples, is that he doesn't veer into arrogance, he's well aware of his talents, or lack there of and has some self esteem issues due to knowing he's not as great as his friend and admirers make him out to be. At the same time, his pride refuses to let him roll over for long if he thinks he or anything he cares about is done wrong to. From his earliest memories it frequently leads to him getting beaten up by his much larger cousin and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a> and later in life it makes him an easy target for those in power to goad into breaking their rules so they can punish him but it also contributes to his continued survival because he feels he <em>has</em> to go down fighting.
</li><li> This was both Snape and Dumbledore's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> in their youth, to similarly disastrous results (ie getting a person they loved killed). Snape always wanted to prove himself being a poor half-blood and thought that joining the Death Eaters would be so cool to the girl he liked (Harry's mom Lily) that she would like him back. This didn't work and she finally broke off their friendship when he called her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur">Fantastic Slur</a> and culminated in her having married the man he hated. Pride then caused him to spy on Dumbledore talking to Trewlawney in the middle of her prophecy about how there was a baby destined to kill Voldemort. He thought this would make him one of Voldemort's inner circle if he told him that kid was Lily's (he got kicked out halfway through the prophecy by Dumbledore's brother Aberforth and didn't know there was another kid to whom it could apply). He begged Voldemort to spare her and he was going to uphold his end of the bargain but she wouldn't let him kill Harry so he killed her. Dumbledore was also seduced by the power an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a> could bring as a teen, in his case Grindelwald. His mother died right after he finished Hogwarts and he had to put his gap year plans on hold to take care of his mentally ill sister Ariana while Aberforth finished school. He resented his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">Promotion to Parent</a> and felt like he was wasting his brilliance being the family breadwinner. He wanted to prove himself so much that he agreed to go look for the Deathly Hallows with Grindelwald with Ariana in tow. Aberforth tried to stop them and she got killed in the chaotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">Mêlée à Trois</a> that ensued when Grindelwald attacked Aberforth.

The last two are worst (they incite genocidal wars and run species into extinction just to prove that their tutory strategy is the best one) and they are the ones that get away relatively easy. Huh. And <em>then</em> there are the Humans, who manage to blunder into a disastrous war with the considerably more powerful Minbari purely out of arrogant carelessness.

At the beginning of the series, Chuck is too proud even to let his office make allowances for his debilitating maybe-medical-maybe-psychological sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, and has become a homebound recluse as a result. A more subtle case is his brother Jimmy, the protagonist of the series — Chuck's perfectionism and defensiveness of his professional reputation repeatedly stymie his own attempts to get his brother to go straight, by causing him to insult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Jimmy's own pride</a>. Jimmy outwardly seems an underachieving, unscrupulous and self-hating person (that's certainly Chuck's impression of him), but he does pride himself on his self-determination, and tends to rankle any time his brother expects him to show gratitude or deference, reacting self-destructively. As the series goes on it becomes increasingly clear that Chuck <em>wants</em> Jimmy to fail at the law, as he resents his brother's easy charm and likability and cherishes the one thing he has that Jimmy doesn't.

He'd rather make and sell meth than ask for or accept help for his family or condition. At one point it's revealed that his partner in grad school created a successful biotech company that his ideas helped create.

</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Jaime:</strong> I couldn't care less what anyone thinks of me. <br/><strong>Tywin:</strong> No, <em>that's</em> what you want people to think of you.
</div><ul><li> Tyrion believes that having too much pride is foolish and it's better to wear your flaws openly. Despite this, it does stick him that his father doesn't acknowledge any of his skills and contributions, even denying him the seat of the ancestral house <em>which is his by right</em>. He admits this to Jaime who chides him for his spiel during his trial, noting that there's only so much he can stand up to abuse before snapping.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Tyrion:</strong> Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour, and it can never be used to hurt you.
</div></li><li> Though a good and moral person, this can be a character flaw of Jon's. His confidence in the superiority of his abilities often causes him to lose sight of the bigger picture and complain about the unfairness of his life. Good thing he has Sam and friends to put things in perspective for him.

The man started the series as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a> who is used as a hatchet man by his bosses and never given the recognition he deserves. In America he finds the freedom to pursue his own goals and becomes a founding partner of Sterling-Cooper-Draper-Pryce. He is justifiably proud of his achievements but his pride soon leads him to make questionable decisions. When a business downturn forces the partners to put more money into the company, he commits all his assets to the venture and does not tell anyone about his difficult financial position. More importantly, he fails to pay his British taxes (the US and UK did not yet have a reciprocity treaty), and a year later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">Inland Revenue</a> sends him a menacing letter saying that if he ever wished to return to Britain and not get arrested, he had to make a very large lump payment that would bankrupt him. Don would have been more than happy to lend Lane the money but Lane's pride prevents him from asking for a loan. Instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he forges a check to get an advance on a bonus. When bonuses are canceled, he cannot return the money and Don tells Lane he has to leave when he finds out about the embezzlement. Lane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">hangs himself in his office rather than face the disgrace</a>.</span> Lane was no longer willing to "suffer the little humiliations" that his life was filled with before he became successful and thus was not able to ask for help when he most needed it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, pride is Uther Pendragon's defining characteristic and ultimately his fatal flaw. He's a tyrant and a bigot who routinely causes wide-scale devastation and misery due to his blind hatred of magic, but as he's a King, he never really has to take responsibility or learn from his mistakes. Almost every sorcerer who terrorises Camelot only does so because Uther has wronged them in some unforgivable way, but he <em>always</em> finds a way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">shift the blame</a> and maintain his unshakeable belief in his own goodness. This arrogance, coupled with extreme paranoia, constantly skews his perceptions and leads him to misjudge people and situations, eventually bringing about his downfall.
<ul><li> When his son Arthur is introduced he displays signs of the same overbearing pride - he's brash, impulsive, and elitist, regularly bullying his underlings and throwing tantrums when things don't go his way. Without the positive influence of Merlin and Gwen, both of whom kick his ass when he deserves it and encourage him to be more thoughtful and compassionate, he could easily have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">Uther 2.0</a>. As it is, he gradually overcomes his pride and resembles his father less and less.
</li></ul></li><li> Holden Ford from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mindhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mindhunter">Mindhunter</a></em> increasingly falls victim to pride throughout the series. As an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> he tends to be right fairly often, but on the occasions when he's misguided, or isn't quite seeing the bigger picture, he <em>still</em> tries to aggressively push his own agenda at any cost despite the reasonable objections of others, and doesn't show much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnapologetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnapologetic">in the way of guilt</a> when things go wrong as a result of his reckless actions. His ultimate aims are good, but he pursues those aims with an unhealthy, single-minded obsessiveness and total disregard for protocol or even basic safety. He also basks in the attention his successes bring him, and expects his girlfriend to be thoroughly invested in his work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">despite seeming fairly uninterested in hers</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, it often appears to be the Kryptonians' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">racial hat</a>, having an inflated sense of ego which causes most of the Kryptonian survivors who find themselves on Earth to quickly devolve into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a>. Even Clark isn't exempt from this, with his pride in being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a> frequently colouring his decisions and serving as his fatal flaw. Series 10 turns this into a major plot-thread, as Clark literally <em>cannot</em> defeat Darkseid until he's learnt humility.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, the Tollan are utterly convinced that they are invulnerable, due to their vast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">technological superiority</a> that is even beyond that of the Goa'uld. Their arrogance eventually lead them to being wiped out, since they never considered that the Goa'uld might eventually find some way to circumvent their technology.

<ul><li> This is one of Captain Kirk's major character flaws.

Interestingly, his literary references in both of his appearances indicate that he's completely aware of this flaw; comparing himself to Satan in "Space Seed," and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Captain Ahab</a></em> in Star Trek II.

<ul><li> Do note that to the ancients just about everywhere, believing oneself equal to or superior to a god -was- an act of overwhelming pride.

<ul><li> In the apocryphal book of Enoch, the archangel of the afterlife Ramiel is <em>filled</em> with it, as is Azazel, who gave humans fashion and metal-working in defiance of the Almighty. They were cast out of Heaven and joined Satan in the angelic rebellion because of it.
</li><li> Lucifer is called a man in the book of Isaiah, where the picture quote comes from. He is also described as the king of Babylon- at the time, Nebuchadnezzar, who was indeed filled with this and was humbled as a result.
</li><li> This trope is likely the reason that the New Testament's sole criteria for salvation is "confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead". Someone who can't conceive of a person more virtuous than themselves- in effect, someone who claims that they've never made a mistake at all- is dangerously wrong. Of course, the Bible is full of examples of people who <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">became</a></em> humble despite their pride, because they were invisibly moved by the Spirit of God.

Cyrusian, the domain of Pride, was the largest and most powerful of the seven realms, and its master, Runelord Xanderghul, was the strongest of the runelords, and one of only two to hold his throne from the empire's founding until it was destroyed in the cataclysm known as Earthfall. Xanderghul was a master of illusion magic, which he used to make himself and his realm appear as impressive as possible at all times. He introduced the faith of the mysterious deity known as the Peacock Spirit to Thassilon, and heavily promoted its faith <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because the Peacock Spirit was actually Xanderghul himself, meaning many of his subjects (and not a few subjects of his rival Runelords) were unwittingly deriving their divine spellcasting abilties from him.</span>

<ul><li> Many Space Marine chapters have this problem. The last codex had optional disadvantages to represent this, such as We Stand Alone — essentially preventing them from <em>ever</em> getting Inquisitorial allies because they refuse help from anyone. Additionally, although some fall to Chaos through despair or rage, many (such as Horus himself or the Inquisitors who believe they can control Chaos) enter the claws of the Dark Gods due to pride - Tzeentch's portfolio includes (in addition to the more infamous Hope and Change) Ambition.
</li><li> The Orks have Flash Gitz, who are this trope personified within Ork society, with a fair share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a> to go with it too. Where normal Orks love fighting anything that moves, Flash Gitz are more concerned with getting more teeth (the Ork currency, mind you) while spending as little of it as possible, and showing off their highly customized guns and money to other Orks. They are widely disliked amongst normal Orks due to these facts for being huge showoffs.
</li><li> Then there were the Thousand Sons. Magnus's two big mistakes: thinking he knew more about the Warp than the Emperor, and thinking he was too smart to fall for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. Then, over the course of about a day, the whole thing came crashing down around his ears.
</li><li> The Eldar, as a race, are now on the brink of extinction due to the Fall but are still full of themselves and refuse to get along with other races. The Dark Eldar take this even further, seeing their Craftworld and Exodite cousins as failures to the Eldar legacy despite that legacy having destroyed their race.
</li><li> The birth of the three younger chaos gods, the Horus Heresy and the fall of half the space marines to chaos, and the opening of the eye all pretty much directly resulted from the Emperor's decision to solve the problem by having everyone ignore it until it went away, because he was the only one superior enough to be allowed to know basic facts about (in-universe) science... reducing the millions of people <em>using</em> that science for basic transportation to the position of blindly poking a cosmic bear with a stick with no warning or ability to take precautions.
</li><li> The Tau are convinced that the Tau'va, or "Greater Good", is the best basis for a culture. This has ended badly for them on multiple occasions, as they've misinterpreted aliens fighting for their own reasons as coming to their aid - leading to unfortunate experiences like hiring Dark Eldar mercenaries or trying to throw a thank-you party for the <em>Necrons</em>.

<ul><li> The rest of the clan are also quite prone to this. Indeed, <em>House of Tremere</em> reveals that pride was the Tremere's impetus for agreeing to the transformation: they were so invested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">the superiority of their own magic</a>, that they came to the conclusion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">magic was actually dying</a> simply because their means of immortality were failing them, and vampirism was the only means of continuing the House's existence; in reality, magic was simply <em>changing.</em> This hubris continues even into the 20th century: quite contrary to the clan belief that magic and all its practitioners would soon be extinct, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">the Order of Hermes</a> still exists in the modern nights - but the Tremere will never admit or acknowledge it.
</li><li> Very deep in the back story, Absimiliard, the progenitor of the Nosferatu clan, killed his sire for scarring his (in his opinion) perfect face during his Embrace. In punishment, his grandsire Caine cursed the entire clan with inhuman hideousness. Proving that he didn't learn anything from the punishment, Absimiliard has become so fixated in regaining his lost beauty that he's prepared to hunt down and murder every last childe in his attempts to appease Caine.
</li><li> The Lasombra Clan, dedicated narcissists and self-styled masters of the earth, have never made much secret of their innate belief in their own right to rule: they still gloat how it was <em>their</em> clan who made the first strike against the Antediluvians, and all other members of the Sabbat were merely imitators.

</li><li> Dealing with this involves a final showdown with the Sha of Pride, the fourth boss in Siege of Orgrimmar, the most powerful sha of all, and the only one Emperor Shaohao didn't purge himself of. To even fight against the Sha, you must complete Norushen's trial (the third boss encounter) in order to sufficiently purge yourself of your corruption. The Sha of Pride uses attacks that increase your Pride, all while saying things such as "You are better than your companions" and "You should bow to no king or warchief," with increasingly negative effects until you are ultimately mind controlled; you must defeat the boss before this can happen.

Fittingly enough, it was <em>Garrosh</em> that allowed the Sha of Pride to manifest completely.

<ul><li> Specifically brought up as a trait of Tygra's and tigers in general. Pride is Tygra's defining flaw for much of the series, driving him to constantly try to prove himself as better than Lion-O in almost every aspect, as well as causing him to be the most prejudiced member of the ThunderCats. That he's a royal, albeit adopted, doesn't help much either. Spoiler: this pride proved to be unfounded when in "The Trials of Lion-O", Lion-O is believed to be dead and Tygra has to take over as leader, only to end up getting the entire team caught when his plan fails miserably. He laments in the jail cell that he didn't know what to do, and while he always criticized Lion-O's plans, they always worked out while all he managed to do was get everyone captured.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In "Native Son," we meet the Tiger Clan and Tygra's father Javan, and as it turns out pride was their downfall. The tigers and Tygus were too proud to join Leo when he rebeled against Mumm-Ra and split from them. When a plague was killing them, they were too proud to seek aid from Thundera and sought help from the Ancient Spirits (of Evil) instead. The Spirits agreed to cure everyone if Javan killed Tygra, but when he saved Tygra instead, the spirits cursed the tigers, letting the plague kill them all and forcing them to haunt their home as undead ghosts, only able to pass on if one of them could overcome their pride and show humility. Tygra's father even tries to keep all this a secret and drive Tygra away rather than have to admit what happened when Tygra becomes bitter about being sent away, all out of pride. Even in this case Tygra's pride gets in the way of seeing that his father was trying to save him from the plague, and it's only when he finds out about the curse that he forgives his father, which ends up lifting the curse.

</li><li> On the other side of the Cybertronian Civil War is Sentinel Prime, also in pretty much every incarnation. He usually means well, is at some level a nice guy, and usually has a history of friendship with Optimus Prime (if he isn't Optimus' father figure), but he's also almost always going to end up at least mildly villainous out of sheer ego.
</li><li> Of course there's Megatron who makes sure that he alone is the undisputed leader of the Decepticons, and he won't allow even Unicron to command him.
