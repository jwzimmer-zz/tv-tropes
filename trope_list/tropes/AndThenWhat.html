<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, in episode 8 of R2, when the Black Knights ask Zero what his plan to fight the Britannians' latest move is, he responds, "Fighting, then more fighting... and then what?" The Black Knights are shocked that he would suggest that there's an alternative to fighting, but he points out that fighting isn't the only way - or the most productive way - to get to their goal of liberating Japan. He manages to come up with a plan that moves them towards that goal without wasting lives in the process (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the famous Million Zeroes gambit</span>). In terms of sides, it's an interesting example, since he's replying to his own side, but at this point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their opponent, the Viceroy of Area 11, is Nunnally, Lelouch's beloved sister</span>, so in a way, he's doing this for <em>both</em> sides.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:

Ogremon seems baffled by the question — he'd never actually thought of it, and eventually dismisses it as a pointless question. As far as he's concerned, the two of them are just going to keep fighting, forever coming to standstills. In his defense, the <em>Adventure</em> continuity is one where all dead Digimon are reborn as Digi-Eggs and hatch back into life, so Leomon and Ogremon can beat the snot out of each other as long as they like without needing a long-term plan.

Since losing the World Martial Arts Tournament at the end of <em>Dragon Ball</em> and having his plans for world domination foiled by Goku, Piccolo's goal has been killing Goku in the name of revenge. But after managing to kill both Goku and Raditz, Piccolo reflects that he got no satisfaction from Goku's death given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">the circumstances</a>, and realizes that he has no idea what to do with his life now that Goku's gone. Training Gohan for the next year brings about Piccolo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and a renewed sense of purpose.
</li><li> During the Cell Saga, Cell freely admits to Piccolo that once he obtains his Perfect form, he has no idea what he'll do afterwards. After he does obtain it, when he's asked again, he decides he'll entertain himself by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">wiping out all life in the universe</a>.

A pause, and then Kenichi asks what the point of that is as they won't be in school forever, and they can't be delinquents forever. Tsuji has no response, so he gets frustrated and attacks Kenichi instead.

<ul><li> Once upon a time, an American executive on vacation was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The tourist complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them:
<div class="indent"><strong>Fisherman</strong>: Only a little while. <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: Why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish? <br/><strong>Fisherman</strong>: With this, I have more than enough to support my family's needs. <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: But what do you do with the rest of your time? <br/><strong>Fisherman</strong>: I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life. <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: I can help you. I have an MBA. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you could run your ever-expanding enterprise. <br/><strong>Fisherman</strong>: But, how long will this all take? <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: 15 to 20 years. <br/><strong>Fisherman</strong>: But what then? <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: That's the best part. When the time is right you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions. <br/><strong>Fisherman</strong>: Millions?...Then what? <br/><strong>Executive</strong>: Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.

<ul><li> In season 5, Tyrion Lannister asks this very question to Jorah Mormont about Daenerys Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne, as if she was expecting that would magically fix everything wrong with Westeros. Clearly, Jorah had never thought that far ahead, and neither had Daenerys. He rightly posits that just because her (insane) father sat on the throne doesn't give her that right over anyone else, nor does that automatically make her a good leader, especially as she hadn't even considered what she would do as Queen of Westeros. This was also Robert Baratheon's exact problem. Daenerys has always assumed the common folk would rally behind her, and that would be enough. Tyrion hypothesizes that, even if the smallfolk would support her (which is a very generous assumption), there are few noble houses that would support the Targaryen cause.

He'd been trying and failing to do so for a season and a half at this point, only to find that every possible guardian is dead. Brienne completely disregards the question, and then acts surprised that Arya runs off on her own instead of going with her.

He doesn't just ask The Entity what it plans to do after it achieves its goal, he continues to point out the pointlessness of its own existence, its quest, and the rather unimpressive ending to its goal which just keeps reiterating the question. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This gets so bad, it sends The Entity into an existential crisis where it begins babbling to itself incoherently, unable to comprehend its own worthlessness despite being a god.

The 5th season, taking place 50 years after the show, reveals that Aku has succumbed to ennui and depression. He spent time eliminating every time portal present and hoped Jack would die out with old age. However, Aku's method of sending Jack to the future also rendered the Samurai biologically immortal, meaning they're at a stalemate. Ironically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aku could've killed Jack when he destroyed the last time portal as Jack succumbed to rage and killed the corrupted lambs, thus becoming unworthy of his sword and it vanishing for decades. Granted, Aku does learn about this and goes to confront Jack, though by the time he does, Jack has undergone theraputic growth that makes him worthy of the sword once more. Eventually Aku is slain when Jack saves Ashi, his friend-turned-lover and daughter of Aku, from Aku's corruption and she uses her Aku-based powers to tear open a hole in time and Jack kills Aku in the past.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParallelLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParallelLives">Parallel Lives</a></em> by Plutarch, when Pyrrhus (yeah, the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">the victory</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">is named after</a>) went to war with Rome, his adviser, Cineas, asked him what he would do after that. Pyrrhus said he would conquer another territory. Cineas asked, "and then"... In short, the final answer of the king was "I'll live a good life and have fun". He had no answer to Cineas' reply, which was "But we can do that now." Cineas was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Epicureanism">Epicurean</a>, whose philosophy emphasized enjoying such simple pleasures (in moderation) and avoiding strife or violence.
</li><li> This is an alternate version of an older anecdote where the characters were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> and Diogenes of Sinope. Diogenes' response was a somewhat more snarky "Why don't you save yourself a lot of trouble and just do that now?" Given Alexander's personality type, it's likely the answer to the question would be a sound "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleNo">no</a>." That man could never be happy unless he was conquering someone/thing. Ultimately he had nothing to worry about considering that his lifestyle of constant battle and hedonism killed him at <em>32</em> (it's possible this was due to being poisoned, however, although that could also be a result of such a lifestyle).
</li><li> The end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> counts for the United States and NATO. For almost 50+ years, they had been embroiled in unarmed political subterfuge in a game of international chess with the only other superpower in the world. Entire strategies had been cooked up for end-of-the-world contingencies, as well as shelters built just in case. Armies had been completely built around what was considered an inevitable ground-war bigger and nastier than anything seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. And then, in possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">one of the largest anticlimaxes in history</a>, the USSR self-destructed rather than fight its own people, leaving the USA as the lone superpower in the world. What were we going to do with this massively bloated defense budget now? Find new enemies elsewhere, of course. Mainly spend millions of dollars fighting terrorism, which can be everywhere, spread over countless countries. That said, most of the rest of NATO seems pretty content with the new status quo and has slashed defense spending across the board.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, this was a party game, like other psychology-inspired games and discussions. One person would talk about what they wanted to do, and the other one would permanently ask "And Then What?", nothing more. One biography of Warren Buffett mentions that he also played this game once (he was the asker), and the nice lady who was his game partner was in tears afterwards. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> were strange...
</li><li> This sort of lack of foresight is a common characteristic of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a> as he appears in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
<ul><li> It was especially common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, where most operations had few ultimate objectives beyond 'advance 2km (the maximum range at which field-artillery can use their fire to 'shelter' your troops to), take X terrain feature'. The two times either side made operational breakthroughs (the Russian Southern Front's 1916 'Brusilov' offensive operation, Germany's 1918 'Michael' offensive operation), no exploitation resulted. Neither of the sides had had the logistical capacity (or at least, the logistical organisation) nor the numbers to continue the advance. In <em>Brusilov</em> the whole point was to (together with the Russian northern front offensive and the Franco-British 'Somme' offensive) tie down German troops and distract them from Verdun, so the goal (conduct successful attack, get enemy to reinforce the sector) was fairly simple, though the actions beyond the initial breakthroughs were an open-ended question. Despite better preparation <em>Michael</em> on the other hand was guilty of the crime of having no specific goals whatsoever beyond making the breakthrough itself, and the starving and exhausted German soldiers (whose logistics assets were too beleaguered to feed them and numbers were too few to allow proper rotation and rest of troops) were simply left free to plunder the (mostly evacuated) French and Belgian villages behind the lines while the Entente forces regrouped. By the time Marshal Ludendorff finally settled on Amiens as the main objective, not only was the city partially in German hands, but the soldiers were so far forward that they weren't getting enough food or ammunition and were being pushed back out.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>, which was in so many ways a dress rehearsal for the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Japanese Wars, had plenty of mistakes of this sort, perhaps the most tragic being the Battle of the Crater, led by the notoriously incompetent Gen. Ambrose Burnside during the siege of Petersburg. While Burnside had actually had a good idea for once (undermine the enemy lines and attack around the resulting crater), the execution was botched, in part because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1tx3v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1tx3v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1tx3v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An all-black unit was assigned for the attack, and was specially trained to go <em>around</em> the crater rather than into it, but they were swapped out at the last minute for an all-white unit in case the attack failed, as Burnside didn't want to be accused of sending black soldiers to their deaths. This white unit was untrained, and their commander, James Ledlie, a lazy bum and a drunkard, never bothered to relay Burnside's basic instruction "don't go in the crater," so the troops ran headlong into the crater, where they were trapped and slaughtered.</span> and partly due to lack of supplies (namely scaling ladders for getting people who fell into the crater back out), but mostly because there was no clear objective for what to do if the assault had succeeded. (There was a general plan, "capture Petersburg, secure it, and move on Richmond," but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">nobody took Step One of Burnside's plan--blowing a hole in Petersburg's defenses with underground explosives--seriously</a>, so when that actually worked, people were confused about how exactly to proceed).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleisterCrowley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleisterCrowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, in his <em>Confessions,</em> recalls the standard missionary tactic his father, a member of the evangelical Plymouth Brethren church, used:
<div class="indent"> He would notice somebody cheerfully engaged in some task and ask sympathetically its object. The victim would expand and say that he hoped for such and such a result. He was now in a trap. My father would say, 'And then?' By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenRecord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenRecord">repeating</a> this question, he would ferret out the ambition of his prey to be mayor of his town or what not, and still came the inexorable 'And then?' till the wretched individual thought to cut it short by saying as little as uncomfortably as possible. 'Oh well, by that time I shall be ready to die.' More solemnly than ever came the question, 'And then?' In this way my father would break down the entire chain of causes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">bring his interlocutor to realize</a> the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt">vanity of human effort</a>. The moral was, of course, 'Get right with God.'
</div></li><li> This is often a problem with single-issue political parties. If they succeed in getting their platform through, they're usually left with little-to-nothing to stand for. So, either they adopt new issues, or they collapse altogether. The worst case scenario is falling into a never-ending cycle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">Moving the Goalposts</a> on what counts as an issue, until they alienate even the most devoted of followers, and/or inadvertently create a counter-movement.
<ul><li> Similarly for single-issue charities. If they resolve whatever issue they were created for, they then must find a new goal or dissolve. As an example, the March of Dimes was created to fight polio; after the vaccine was widely distributed, they moved on to researching the prevention of birth defects and premature birth.
