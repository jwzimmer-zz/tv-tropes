<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yagami Light: He wasn't exactly chosen, it was pure luck. But according to Ohba Tsugumi, the creator, Light would have become a great detective and worked side-by-side with L himself on many cases had he not touched the Death Note. Fans even calculated that he would have lived a long life, to somewhere in his eighties. As it was, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he goes batshit insane, gets many people including his own father killed (and his sister became a vegetable, great job Light), and he dies in his early twenties.</span>
</li><li> L qualifies as well. Thanks to his smarts, he's the only one able to threaten Light's killing spree during the first arc, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends up dead.</span> Oops.
</li><li> All of the children at Wammy's. While the orphanage certainly seems like a better choice than some others, they are literally being raised and groomed to succeed a highly intelligent, enigmatic detective.
<ul><li> Near and Mello, L's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> successors.</span> They probably both suffered through the trials that Wammy's put them through to deem them worthy of succeeding the Century's Greatest Detective. Look how they turned out. Mello is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> quite obviously not totally mentally stable, has a <em>massive</em> inferiority complex, and winds up dead.</span> Near is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> completely isolated from society with only his subordinates for company, unable to interact with and understand others (or at least having a lot of trouble with it), in part thanks to his upbringing. He ends up inheriting the mantle of L, and, as a result, having to shoulder the pressure of living up to the world's expectations.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>, being a good guy SUCKS. The world is such a cruel, dark place that the only ones who truly enjoy their lot are the rotten ones, while the heroes must fight their own despair as well as the bad guys. Part of the reasons so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">Tender Tears</a> are shed in the series. In particular, being the chosen heir of Hokuto Shinken dooms you to a life of hardship, and in Kenshiro's time, there are THREE men, including him, worthy of succession.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> shows this in Shinji Ikari, who pretty much hates his role as the savior of Tokyo 3 throughout the series. The few times he does get a little bit cocky about it, he is swiftly and cruelly brought back down to earth.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> are not happy. They have traded their freedom for a lifetime of fighting witches for a single wish, which may not even be worth it anymore. Fighting the witches systematically tears apart their social lives. And if a puella magi dies in the witch's other world, her body never appears in the real world. They're missing. Forever.
<ul><li> To add insult to the injury, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> anyone who becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> is already dead by the time they make the contract. To be precise, a Magical Girl in this universe is essentially a Lich, and only maintains life and normal function through the presence of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Gem</a>, which cannot be farther than 100 meters from her or she will fall into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a> state and eventually start to decompose much like a corpse.</span>
<ul><li> <em>And</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Witches</a> they were fighting this whole time? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie">They used to be magical girls just like them.</a> Turns out that to accept a contract and become a magical girl, you're also <em>damning</em> yourself to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> and be killed by another girl later—there's no way around it, and it is <em>inevitable</em>, unless you die in battle first. Thus, any magical girl killed in action and proclaimed missing is <em>lucky</em> (in fact, its implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">this is why the witches are killing them in the first place</a>). And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot">Kyubey</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor">knows</a></em> this but has been keeping it from the girls it contracts.</span>
</li><li> There's also the fact that Kyubey mentions that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a magical girl's potential strength comes from her hardships (hence why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Madoka's</a> potential baffled him). In practice this means you're taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>, granting them one wish, and <em>then</em> making them suffer horribly.</span>

<ul><li> Jesus, himself, had a pretty terrible situation. As the Metatron points out, he, as The Voice of God, had to tell this 12 year old, who only wanted to play and be like his friends, that <em>he</em> was the Savior of his people, but the very people whom he came to save would be the ones to kill him. And, he couldn't even hear it directly from his own father because his human heart and mind would explode.
<ul><li> Jesus apparently still felt some of this even after growing up and accepting his destiny. Rufus mentions that Jesus often seemed happiest just listening to people talk about all the unimportant little things going on in their lives. Bethany speculates it was because not having anything important to talk about was a luxury Jesus never had.

He is prophesied to be the one to finally kill Morgoth in the final battle, however most readers would probably conclude that it isn't worth it.

You've been given the ability to shape shift into any animal! Sounds like fun, right? Just make sure you don't accidentally get trapped as a bird or caterpillar or something. Oh, and you have to fight alien invaders, but you can't tell anybody, not even your parents or the cops, because they might actually be under alien control. So enjoy risking life and limb fighting an increasingly violent guerrilla war as your innocence is shattered and you question your every moral value.

Sure, they are immortal, worshipped, immensely powerful and impossibly skilled, with magic powers that essenially make them war gods, but whenever there's no Desolation on Roshar, they must go to Braize and let themselves be tortured by literal embodiment of Divine Rage before one of them breaks and they're sent back to fight in a Desolation. No wonder the story starts with them saying "screw this" and walking away.

The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuneMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuneMessiah">Dune Messiah</a></em>, shows how it really affected him emotionally as he earns many enemies, goes blind after a failed assassination attempt, and foresees that his beloved concubine would die of giving birth of their twins. In the end, he walks into the desert as he couldn't bear to continue his role and leaves behind his empire and his children.

</li></ul></li><li> Riou and Jowy become the Bearers of the Bright Shield and Black Sword Runes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em>. The Runes are two halves of the True Rune of Beginning. The Bearers are inevitably driven into circumstances <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne">where they must fight each other to the death to reunite the Rune</a>. Even worse, the Runes <em>always</em> choose best friends as their Bearers. <em>The Runes force best friends to kill each other.</em>
</li><li> Lazlo <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">en Kuldes</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em> ends up with a True Rune that is just as sucky as the Soul Eater. The Rune of Punishment drains its bearer's lifeforce each time it is used. Eventually, the Rune will <em>consume</em> its bearer and trap them inside it forever <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is what happens to Lazlo in the bad ending</span>. Worse, the Bearers inevitably find themselves in situations where they have no choice but to use the Rune's power. Fortunately, there is one way to avoid this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Rune governs atonement <em>and</em> forgiveness. An act of extreme forgiveness by the Bearer can shift the Rune into its forgiveness phase, in which it no longer feeds on the Bearer to use its powers. If Lazlo recruits the other 107 Stars of Destiny, he gets an opportunity to recruit and forgive his former friend turned enemy Snowe (the last Star of Destiny) for his earlier betrayal at the beginning of the game. Forgiving Snowe completes the gathering of the 108 Stars of Destiny and is a strong enough act of forgiveness to shift the Rune of Punishment.</span>

There's just one catch: Zanik is of the Dorgeshuun, a group of pacifist cave goblins who renounced Bandos after he ordered them to partake in a battle they had no chance of winning for no reason. There's an entire quest series devoted to Zanik basically telling Bandos to fuck off.
<ul><li> The player character themself is chosen by Guthix to become the World Guardian, immune to the powers of gods, with the destiny of preventing divine oppression or God Wars from plaguing Gielinor. This means the rest of the gods are now targeting you, either for mind games or for murder.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to above, the Protagonist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>. For him, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> means being fated to fight a series of terrifyingly powerful demons in a contest for power that will make him a target of Heaven and the demons if he goes too far out of line... not to mention being personally responsible for the lives of everybody in the lockdown.
</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> also has it pretty bad. After finding out about the Dark Hour, he/she joins a group dedicated to stopping it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Only to find out that they were unwittingly played in order to bring about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>.

This results in him/her having to make a sadistic choice.

</li><li> The whole playable cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em> gets it bad across both games of the duology, Tatsuya in particular. Turns out being caught in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJob">Book of Job</a></em>-style contest between two powerful (and otherwise evenly-matched) gods of humanity's creative and destructive sides, each trying to see which of their respective domains is stronger in humanity, just completely sucks. And that's before one of them decides to kick over the table when things don't go his way.
</li><li> A couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> characters qualify:
<ul><li> Isaac, the player character of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> game, is chosen directly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">The Wise One</a> to make the hard decision of whether Alchemy is restored to the world or not, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality">which isn't the black-and-white situation it initially seems to be</a>. And the fate of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> hangs in the balance... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">Isaac is nearly forced to knowingly murder him himself</a> to confirm a choice that he can't ever be sure was the right one.
</li><li> Ivan was given up by his family as an infant to ensure he would be in the correct place to join Isaac and Garet on their quest. He was raised by non-Adepts in Kalay, and was considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> for his powers. Ivan finds out about his destiny when his foster-father is held for ransom in the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> and his foster-mother <em>forbids him from helping</em> so he will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">go fulfill the prophecy instead</a> (if you rescue Hammet anyway, Layana yells at Ivan for disobeying her orders and jeopardizing the prophecy). When Ivan reaches Contigo in the second game, he learns that his birth mother died of a broken heart over giving him up, and his only blood relative refuses to get close to him because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">that prophecy's not fulfilled yet</a>.

To note:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> shows us how much it sucks to be the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnchosenOne">Un</a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnchosenOne">chosen One</a>. Due to some completely random coincidences, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protagonist">The Agent</a> gets sent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">the Emperor</a> to Daggerfall on a seemingly minor mission, but find themselves in the middle of a massive political <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> with heaps of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>. Just for doing what they're told, the various factions are constantly sending assassins after the Agent, and they quickly learn directly or implicitly that few people are actually trustworthy around the Iliac Bay. In <em>Morrowind</em>, we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergingTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergingTheBranches">all of the morally gray outcomes are canonical</a> due to a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBreak">Time Break</a>, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> ending where the Numidium <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">kills the Agent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">obliterates their immortal soul</a> because they are unworthy.</span>
</li><li> The Nerevarine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> definitely gets the cosmic short end of the stick. While all of the Chosen Ones in <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> series have to endure many hardships to accomplish their goals, none of the others get infected with a horrible mutating disease as part of their divine mission (though the Nerevarine is able to eventually remove the negative aspects of it). It also sucks because <em>everyone</em> around the Nerevarine is trying to manipulate him/her: the Emperor, the Tribunal, Azura, Dagoth Ur, <em>everyone</em>. And in the end, the Nerevarine <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saves Tamriel from the threat of Dagoth Ur, but at the same time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">unintentionally sets in motion Morrowind's destruction</a>.</span> In <em>Oblivion</em>, it is mentioned that the Nerevarine apparently took an expedition to Akavir, and hasn't been heard from since. The Nerevarine's story essentially ends with him/her the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">Ageless</a> hero of a land that has been destroyed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">most of his/her accomplishments rendered moot</a>, and having vanished off the face of Tamriel entirely.
</li><li> The Champion of Cyrodiil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> doesn't have it much better. The Champion actually <em>fails</em> his/her mission to stop Mehrunes Dagon's invasion and has to watch as the other Chosen One, whom s/he has been helping and protecting throughout the main questline, sacrifices himself to save the world. The Champion is later tapped to be the successor of the Daedric Prince of Madness, Sheogorath, which entails leaving Cyrodiil behind and gradually going insane as mad gods are wont to do. YMMV on how bad it is being a god of madness, though.
</li><li> Being the Dragonborn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> means every major cosmic power either wants to kill you, use you, or both. Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora is particularly interested in Dragonborn, and arranges events that eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">force the Dragonborn to act as his new champion.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is probably the most prominent trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">Continuing is Painful</a>. Sure, you're effectively immortal and will return to life after being killed, but all this means is that you will be dying repeatedly, each time horribly. You'll also watch as your friends and allies die and go hollow one by one.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>. Prince Lothric was designated at birth to be the one to Link the Flame, but he grew to resent his role due to everyone knowing that he would be the one to do it and thus never being allowed any sort of choice or say in the matter. This eventually caused him to become disillusioned and misanthropic to the whole affair, to the point where he decides to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall">let the Age of Dark come</a>, rather than submit himself and his brother to the Flame again.
</li></ul></li><li> Ark from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em>. It turns out that returning life to the surface world requires <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the destruction of his own, himself included. The real kick to the balls is the implication that his past incarnations have been doing this since the dawn of time.</span>
</li><li> Duran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgarestSenki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgarestSenki">Agarest Senki</a></em>.

</li><li> Being the Chosen One of any of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> games tends to come with a lot of headaches. This is particularly true of Hawke, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, who just can't seem to catch a break.

Hawke's return appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> shows the player just how much all of this is wearing them down, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then they may be called upon to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> on top of everything else.</span>
