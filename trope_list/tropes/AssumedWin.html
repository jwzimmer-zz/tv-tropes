Everyone else is too (except Fumina herself, who is alternately wishing to either die of embarrassment or kill Minato), as it honestly is a very well-built model. When Meijin Kawaguchi announces the winner, he announces it's Entry #9, causing Minato to jump up in excitement... only for the Meijin to say "Oops, excuse me", turn the card over, and announce that Entry #<em>6</em>, Yuuma's Lightning Zeta Gundam, is the winner. Turns out building a model based on a real person without their permission is against the rules, and Minato was disqualified.

The judge says that maybe the Rebels won, since one saved the other, but when the Rebels are incredulous, he says no, the Imperials won, he was just impressed. It ends up moot anyway, since the Imperial trooper's commander stole the prize, a fugitive who knew something useful, and fled, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">leaving those troopers behind to be sold into slavery</a>.

When the votes for Tracy that Jim had thrown away are found in the trash, she's recognized as the rightful winner.

Something of an oddity, in that Eeyore is not normally the sort to assume that he's the winner; on the contrary, he's so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">incorrigibly pessimistic</a> that he figures he must be the guest of honour because otherwise he wouldn't have been invited at all.

Later, when it comes time to give out the awards, Rabbit awards the pot of honey to... the red balloon. Later, Pooh goes to Owl's house, and discovers that Owl had picked up Eeyore's tail and had been using it as a doorbell tassel. Later on, Pooh decides to return Eeyore's tail instead of staying for snacks, and he receives a giant pot of honey as his prize.

Her gymnastics teacher is announcing who qualified for a special traveling team, and Karen stands up to greet the teacher and "accept" the invitation right before she reads the last name; one of her classmates grabbed her and yanked her back down before she could embarrass herself further.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> used this trope at least twice.
<ul><li> Ine one episode, Frasier has been nominated for an award for his radio show. Initially determined to win, he talks to another character who is due to retire later that year, and so will never again have an opportunity to win the award (having never won it before). Frasier realises that if he does win, he'll be racked with guilt for having prevented the other guy from winning, and so starts to hope that the other guy wins it instead. When it is announced that it is a tie, he is suddenly hopeful, thinking that they could share the award, but the tie turns out to actually be between the remaining two nominees, neither of whom have been seen before.
</li><li> In another episode, restaurant critic Gil Chesterton has received his first award nomination in a category with two other nominees. Once again, the verdict is announced as a tie, leading Gil to fume that he will have to share his award... and, as in the earlier episode, the tie turns out to be between the other two nominees.

In it, Al Bundy distracts <em>the entire banquet</em> by getting into a fistfight outside, and comes back several minutes later victorious. The only one left in the room was Peggy... who then broke into the ballot box and removed every vote that wasn't for her. She still acted surprised when she won, while another woman was ready to give her acceptance speech before the winner was declared.

Richard Hammond clearly expects his 1963 Opel Kadett ("Oliver") to win, since "he" made the journey unmodified, though the car did develop some problems after an unsuccessful attempt to ford a river. The other two presenters give the award to a Volkswagen Beetle instead, as it followed them as the backup vehicle and had <em>no</em> problems at all.
</li><li> Another episode had a race across Liverpool to the Liver Building between James in a new Peugeot and a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">traceurs</a>. The trope came into play at the finish line.
<div class="indent"><strong>James:</strong> And they're not here. They are not here. No sign of combat trousers about.

Maya gets upset with Jack after she gets him to work for one of the charities she supports, he simply hires workers to do the work, and wins an award. The charity then goes to honor someone else. Convinced it's one of the models, Maya takes to the stage and verbally berates the charity for selling out. It's then revealed that the "someone else" is her.

The results of the election are read and Blair starts to take a victory pose when it's announced that Jo actually won. However, Jo becomes overcome with the attention and turns it down, prompting Blair to state that if the winner cannot perform her duties, the title passes to the first runner up. Mrs. Garrett then reveals that she herself is the first runner up. (Blair asks how she did and is told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontWantToKnow">You Don't Want to Know</a>.)

Unfortunately, Sophia, who's making the announcement, is only calling on Rose to bring her some water. It turns out that the winner is Agnes Bradshaw, whom Rose expected to beat since Agnes had recently passed away. Rose proceeds to have a meltdown:

Ryan immediately gets up to accept it, but then subtly angrily sits down after Danny Cordray (who isn't even there) is announced as the winner.
<div class="indent"> ''How do I feel about not winning Hottest In the Office this year? Um, I'm very relieved. How do-how do you even judge something like that? What is his criteria even? It's-it's so subjective.' '

<ul><li> Also happens to Lexi in the episode "EndurANTs". Lexi and Paisely disguise themselves as music and art ANTs in order to enter the ANT-Lympics and win the $50,000. When the announcer says "And the award goes to...", Lexi immediately goes onstage and starts bragging about herself and "thanking" everyone. However, she then finds out that the award is actually for an Australian team and angrily reveals her true age and occupation which sadly outranked Webster High to 2nd place with $49,000.

After all of the Greendale and City College paintball players are eliminated, it's down to just Britta and two City College players. Britta takes them out and starts celebrating, only to be taken out by two more City College players who had remained hidden. The City College players and Dean Spreck start cheering over their victory when another City College player runs up to join in. The previous two realize they don't know him seconds before he shoots them both. He then removes his mask to reveal he's Pierce.

Chancellor Tootietootie shows up at the Russo home to announce that one of the siblings will be receiving the Wizard Of The Year award. Justin immediately assumes that the award is for him and starts bragging about his delinquent class until Tootietootie reveals that the award is entitled to Alex for saving the world from the Angels of Darkness in "Wizards vs Angels". Justin is outraged by this and insists that <em>he</em> deserves it more, even delivering a heated holographic message at the banquet.

Jonah is abrasive, highly gaffe-prone, and possesses zero ability to connect with voters, while his opponent Judy, the widow of the former congressman, is a widely loved sweet old lady. Jonah looks certain to lose, until he shoots himself in the foot (literally) while filming a campaign commercial, and Judy is caught on camera saying "guns can be dangerous", causing the NRA to buy attack ads against her. On election day, Jonah eeks out a narrow win.

When Diane storms off, Peter says that the role is going to the person who really deserves it, someone tempered by generations of oppression of African-Americans. Loretta starts to thank Peter, only for him to interrupt "Don't be so full of yourself, I'm talking about me".

He still stands up and adjusts his tie when it is said the winner has a "red nose" and "baggy pants" and it is not until the winner's name is announced that he realises he has not won.
<ul><li> The B-plot of "Lisa's Substitute" has Bart running for class president, and declaring where his <em>victory party</em> will be held at the moment the polls are opened. Unfortunately, everyone's so busy celebrating that they forget to vote, leading to Martin Prince's moment of triumph with a parody of the "Dewey Defeats Truman" headline mentioned above.

This is in front of a group of people outside the school, and Principal Skinner walks up to the podium to acknowledge this, smiling, but once Bart's name is announced, he keeps walking and grinning to avoid embarrassment.
</li><li> At the beginning of "Deep Space Homer", he's expecting the "Worker of the Week" award because every other worker already received it — but instead, it goes to an inanimate carbon rod.
</li><li> In "Lisa's Rival", Lisa gets into an epic saxophone duel with Allison Taylor during an audition for First Chair in the school band, culminating with them blasting a long note until Lisa faints.

Cat, thoroughly incensed, sabotages Dog's health in order to win the part and ends up succeeding due to Dog being incapacitated by his illness. Thus, Cat stars as the leading role as Abraham Lincoln and ends up doing an amazing job, earning a standing ovation for his performance. Later at an award ceremony, Cat awaits his award for best actor, knowing that he deserved it because of his skill and finesse and thus, makes his speech before the award is even given out. The award goes to Dog instead, for his amazing performance as Abraham Lincoln's mute steed and it turns out that the standing ovation from before was all for Dog.

</li><li> Also during the Talent Show episode, Kim competed, and both she and Bonnie assumed they would win, when the prize went to Ron Stoppable, the judge citing quantity over quality.

<p></p><h2>Real life examples:</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Politics </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The 1948 presidential election between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Harry S Truman</a> and Thomas Dewey is the king of real life election upsets.
<ul><li> Truman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>s elevated Vice President, was running for a second term against Dewey, the charismatic Governor of New York, which would result in a fifth consecutive Democratic presidential victory. Truman seemed doomed to failure: he had low approval ratings, barely earned the nomination of his party, and opinion polls (then in their infancy) had Dewey winning the election in a landslide. Trumans campaign was perpetually cash-short, and nearly all of his aides, and even his wife Bess believed they were going to lose. Dewey on the other hand was coddled by the media, his campaign was a well-funded machine, and some of his staff were so confident in him winning they had already bought homes in D.C. in preparation for working in his administration. The Democratic Party appeared in shambles, with Strom Thurmond and Henry Wallace leaving the party and running as third party candidates, siphoning off much of Trumans support. 80% of newspapers and magazines endorsed Dewey and had prewritten their election coverage believing he would win, with the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> going to print with the infamous Dewey Defeats Truman bulldog edition headline on election night.
</li><li> Truman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorneredRattlesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorneredRattlesnake">believing he had nothing to lose</a>, spent the final weeks of the election crisscrossing the country, making up to thirteen campaign stops a day, holding rallies where he ridiculed Dewey's refusal to address specific issues, and the Republican-controlled "do nothing" Congress with a wave of relentless and blistering partisan assaults. While this happened, Dewey defaulted to a "run out the clock" strategy, avoiding controversial issues and speaking vaguely of his plans for his presidency, including the now infamous quote "You know that your future is still ahead of you." The major polls were so sure of Dewey's victory they stopped polling voters weeks before the election, missing the Hail Mary surge of Truman's support from his aggressive campaigning in the final days.
</li><li> On election night the returns skewed much more towards Truman than expected, with Dewey barely carrying Pennsylvania and New York, his home state where he was the sitting governor. Truman acquired an early lead that he never lost, and reached the electoral votes needed to win by the next morning. What mattered was that Truman had narrowly won Ohio, California, and Illinois, which carried a total of 78 electoral votes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mzpl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mzpl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mzpl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Had Dewey won Ohio, California and Illinois he would have won the election in the Electoral College, even if not winning the popular vote. Had Dewey won only two (any two) of the three states, Truman would have had the most electoral votes but the Dixiecrats would have succeeded in their goal of forcing the election into the House of Representatives. The extreme closeness of the vote in these three states was the major reason why Dewey waited until late on the morning of November 3 to concede.</span>
</li><li> Complacency on Dewey's part also aided his defeat. He didn't bother to campaign in states like Ohio and Wisconsin where he had defeated President Roosevelt four years earlier, assuming he would easily win them again, and they ended up flipping to Truman. Ultimately Dewey's popular vote percentage was slightly lower than it was in 1944. Thurmond and Wallace also didn't end up taking away as many voters from Truman as thought, also a cause of Truman's higher than expected totals. Truman famously posed with the incorrect <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, but we can assume that Dewey was not so enchanted.
</li></ul></li><li> Funny how the lesson wasn't learned in 2000, when networks prematurely called the election for Bush and then Gore and then Bush again, and many newspapers had to scramble to reprint the front page headline.
</li><li> The 1916 presidential election: Republican challenger Charles Evans Hughes went to bed believing that he had won the election, but late returns from California showed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> had carried the state, and thereby the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">Electoral College</a>. An apocryphal account states a reporter called to ask Hughes for his reaction and was told by a servant "The President-elect has retired and does not wish to be disturbed." To which the reporter said, "When the President-elect is available, please tell him that he is not the President-elect." This incident is depicted in the 1944 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wilson">Wilson</a></em>.
</li><li> Similarly, during the 1976 Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin, Arizona Congressman Mo Udall had been projected the winner of that primary over front-runner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a>, with some newspapers printing that Udall had won in their headlines and Udall himself proclaiming "Oh, how sweet it is" (Udall was hoping that a win would slow Carter's momentum to the nomination down). Once the votes were counted, it was Carter that won that particular primary by 1% (roughly 7,500 votes) en route to the nomination and the presidency; while Udall would finish a distant second at the Democratic Convention that year. (Udall rather memorably "accepted" defeat by saying, "The people have spoken - the bastards.")
</li><li> A non-voting example: in the lead up to the 1988 vice presidential debate, there was a general expectation that the Republican nominee, Senator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DanQuayle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DanQuayle">Dan Quayle</a>, would <a class="urllink" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-debate-quayle-bentsen-20161004-snap-story.html">mop the floor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the Democratic nominee, Senator Lloyd Bentsen. 41-year-old Quayle was charismatic, photogenic, and full of quips; while Bentsen, 67, was anything but and reportedly wanted to skip the debate out of fear of being outshined by Quayle. During the debate, Quayle compared himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and Bentsen delivered his infamous put-down, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">"I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, youre no Jack Kennedy."</a> The media agreed the debate was a disaster for Quayle and this line was pretty much the <em>only</em> thing anyone took away from it. (This didn't affect the outcome much, and the Bush/Quayle ticket won in a landslide.)
</li><li> The 1990 US Senate election in Minnesota had incumbent Senator Rudy Boschwitz go up against Paul Wellstone, a political science professor at Carleton College who had never held government office. Boschwitz outraised Wellstone by a 7-to-1 margin and tepidly campaigned, viewing Wellstone as a fringe candidate who posed no serious risk to his re-election bid, and never responded to Wellstone's requests for a debate. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/us/the-1990-elections-minnesota-professor-s-everyman-appeal-wins-a-senate-seat.html">The New York Times<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> described Wellstone's campaign style as, "[wearing] work shirts and jeans, Mr. Wellstone traveled the state in a rickety school bus, wrote his own speeches and stayed in people's homes rather than hotels." Boschwitz didn't hit the campaign trail in earnest until late October polls showed a gap of only a few percentage points separating the two, down from the large leads he had held throughout the year, though Boschwitz still usually polled ahead. Wellstone's everyman image struck a chord with voters, and he won the election by 48,000 votes and a margin of 2.5%.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> was expected to cruise to a victory in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, even though Illinois Senator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> had been gaining in the polls. Clintons campaign was so confident of an early win that it hadnt made any preparations for a race going beyond early February (the final primaries were scheduled for June). The first contest in Iowa was won by Obama, with Clinton coming in <em>third</em>. The primaries turned into a protracted contest with Obama only reaching a majority on the final day.
<ul><li> Though Hillary Clinton has a habit of ending up on the losing side of political upsets, one upset in her favor was the New Hampshire primary. On the day of the contest the polls had Barack Obama ahead <a class="urllink" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_primary-194.html">by nearly 10%<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> riding on a surge of momentum and would be in for a sizable win. Clintons campaign was so sure they were in for a loss that they wanted to leave the state early and campaign for future contests, but she insisted on campaigning until election day. Women and senior voters ended up heavily breaking for her, and during an event on election day Clinton nearly broke into tears, which apparently helped voters empathize with her. When the results came in Clinton eked out a narrow win.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2009 Israeli national elections, the Kadima party assumed victory since they won the most seats, one seat more than the runner-up Likud party. However, since Israel uses a parliamentary system, the winning party is required to form a coalition government made up of the majority of the parliament. Kadima was unable to do since the smaller parties were aligned with the Likud, leaving Likud the actual winner.
</li><li> In the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney was apparently <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/why_romney_was_surprised_to_lose_his_campaign_had_the_wrong_numbers_bad.html">almost sure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he was going to defeat President Barack Obama. Polling for the most part indicated a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html">close race<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though Romney's much-hyped "Project Orca" computer system for tracking voters indicated he would win decisively. The Romney campaign was so sure of a win that they planned an election night fireworks display, had already designed a <a class="urllink" href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-transition-website-where-president-elect-romney/">transition website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Romney had written <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Romney-Victory-Speech-Concession/2012/11/06/id/463065/">a victory speech<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but hadn't bothered with a concession speech. On election night, most of the major swing states were called early for Obama, and Ohio's call at 11 pm EST pushed Obama over the 270 electoral votes needed to win re-election.
</li><li> Also in 2012, polls in deep-red North Dakota had Democratic candidate Heidi Heitkamp trailing her Republican opponent Rick Berg by double-digits in the Senate race. The next morning she <a class="urllink" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heitkamp-dewey-beats-truman-2012-11">recreated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the iconic Truman photo after the race was called for her.
</li><li> In 2014 Eric Cantor, then the House Majority Leader, was confident he would cruise to reelection in his central Virginia district even though his primary challenger David Brat, a college professor who had never held government office, had been gaining ground against him in polls, running on an anti-establishment and right-wing populist platform. Cantor had the backing of the national party and outspent Brat 40-to-1. Cantor apparently didn't consider Brat much of a threat and rented out a large ballroom for what he assumed would be his victory party. The race was called for Brat soon after polls closed, who won by a comfortable 10% margin. To be "Cantored" even became political terminology for when a high-ranking politician is unexpectedly defeated by an unknown from within their own party.
<ul><li> 2018 had a few Cantorings. In New York's 14th district, Joe Crowley was one of the top-ranking Democrats in Congress and had been frequently mentioned as a potential speaker should his party regain control of the House. Crowley had served for ten terms and never had to compete in a primary until Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old bartender and Democratic Socialist running her first campaign, challenged him. Crowley didnt perceive her as a threat - the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/nyregion/ocasio-cortez-crowley-primary-upset.html">only available polling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed him 36 points ahead. In the end it wasn't even close, Ocasio-Cortez won by a comfortable 15% margin in what the media referred to as a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/joe-crowley-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-new-york-upset/index.html">"titanic upset"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Crowley couldn't concede because his campaign never bothered to ask for her phone number. This set the stage for another longtime establishment figure in the Democratic Party, Bostons Mike Capuano, to be ousted by Ayanna Pressley in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/08/02/wbur-poll-capuano-pressley-7th-district">similar upset<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after polls had her trailing by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/09/04/capuano-pressley-count-experience-support-win-primary/BexLGYivjWMnwv4jaYTC1N/story.html">double-digits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> less than a month out.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2014 Maryland gubernatorial election started with Democratic incumbent Lieutenant Governor Anthony G. Brown running against Republican Larry Hogan. Brown had several major advantages out of the gate, he outraised Hogan by a 2-to-1 margin, had high-profile surrogates like Barack and Michelle Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton traveling the state on his behalf, and stated he thought his victory in the heavily Democratic-leaning state would be "a little bit of a molehill". <a class="urllink" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/md/maryland_governor_hogan_vs_brown-5098.html">Every public poll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> taken of the race showed Brown ahead, usually by double-digit margins. On Election Day, returns skewed surprisingly strongly for Hogan, with low turnout in urban areas, and the race was called for Hogan a few hours later. A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/larry-hogan-maryland-governor-112681">post-mortem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em>Politico</em> credited Hogan's strong anti-tax message and Brown's lack of any strong message for the upset.
</li><li> The 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> was one of the biggest pundit failures in history,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31bta');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31bta" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31bta');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many people blamed polling for the mistake, but it was always closer than people thought. They also did not understand the concept of correlated error (e.g. if there's a polling error in Wisconsin in the direction of the Republican, there's likely to be similar ones in the demographically similar states of Michigan and Pennsylvania as well)</span> to the point one could call it "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo">Dewey v. Truman 2: Electric Boogaloo</a>". Prior to the election, Clinton was considered to have handily won all three presidential debates, led in nearly all polls, and forecasters universally predicted she would win with an unbreakable 270-plus vote firewall and Trump never had a prayer of winning. FiveThirtyEight, the most conservative forecaster, gave her a 71% chance of winning, while The New York Times pegged her at 85% and Huffpost Pollster at 98%. Clintons campaign planned a massive victory rally at New York Citys Javits Convention Center, a fireworks display over the Hudson River on election night, and confetti resembling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">shattered glass</a>. Trump held a modest election night event in the New York Hilton ballroom, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-14/trump-says-he-expected-to-lose-election-because-of-poll-results">expecting to only deliver a short concession speech<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Newsweek even printed and shipped to stores a commemorative issue celebrating Clintons victory as the first woman president. On election night Trump unexpectedly won Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mipd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mipd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mipd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(A state Clinton was apparently so sure she would win that she never set foot in it during the campaign)</span> by narrow margins, all states that Clinton had a comfortable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5shpy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5shpy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5shpy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">but overestimated</span> polling lead in and none of which had voted Republican in a Presidential election since the 1980s. This is attributed to the high turnout from non-college educated white voters and a decline in reliable Democratic demographics. Trump won the electoral college and therefore the presidency. While the polling industry was widely criticized for its perceived overconfidence in Clinton winning, the one thing most polls did accurately predict was that Clinton would receive substantially more votes than Trump nationwide, with her winning the popular vote by 2.9 million and a margin of 48%-46%.
<ul><li> Michigan's polling failure must have given Clinton deja-vu, because just months earlier <a class="urllink" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/mi/michigan_democratic_presidential_primary-5224.html">polls indicated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> she would win the state's primary election against Bernie Sanders in a landslide, while in the end Sanders won the state by a narrow margin.
</li></ul></li><li> After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") on June 28, 2012, CNN and Fox News Channel incorrectly reported that the law had been repealed right as the news broke. Apparently they rushed through the court's text and did not realize the controversial mandate the court was reviewing had been upheld as a tax. Given the nuance, in this case, it could be honestly misread in the rush to get to air. At the crux of the case was whether Congress could enact legislation that compelled participation in interstate commerce, i.e. force someone to buy something. The ruling said that while Congress could regulate interstate commerce, it could not compel a citizen to participate in it. This is where Fox began reporting on the repeal as it doomed the government's argument. However, further on, SCOTUS found that the ACA was not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">Tax without using the T-Word,</a> and under that logic, the bill was a-okay. It should be pointed out that this was not the victory proponents wanted, because much of the opposition to the bill was centered on it being forced participation and/or a tax.
<ul><li> In 2017, after the Republicans gained control of the presidency, Senate, and House, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried unsuccessfully several times to pass an Obamacare repeal bill that appealed to both moderates and conservatives in the party. In July 2017 his party drafted what the media referred to as a "skinny repeal" bill that would repeal key parts of Obamacare and had seemingly secured enough votes to pass it, as only moderate Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski publicly opposed the bill, and a 50-50 tie would be broken by Vice President Mike Pence who supported the bill. During the floor vote Sen. John McCain unexpectedly voted against the bill, causing it to fail 51-49.
</li></ul></li><li> During the elections for the new Pope in 2013, many of the Italian cardinals assumed Milan Archbishop Angelo Scola would be picked, and had already sent him letters of congratulation when it was revealed that Argentinian Jorge Bergoglio was picked instead.
<ul><li> And on the subject of papal elections: "A man who enters the conclave as pope will often leave it as [a] cardinal".
</li></ul></li><li> Tony Abbott's first attempt at a Federal election in Australia. Some time during the live count, the entire party was celebrating what looked like an insurmountable lead. As it turned out, both major parties tied for seats won — and the independents who won the remaining seats chose to favour Julia Gillard's party, giving her the win.
</li><li> Australia later had a famous example with the 2019 Federal Election. The reigning Liberal Coalition had been behind in the polls for years prior, and nearly every opinion poll agreed that it wasn't a question of <em>if</em> they would lose the election, but <em>by how much</em>, with the Liberal campaign considered to more be about making their inevitable defeat less of a bloodbath. Come election day, not only did the Liberals win, they won by a <em>huge</em> margin, taking their government from a Minority to a Majority, in a result that nearly <em>inverted</em> the predicted one. Prime Minister Scott Morison even described it as a "miracle" in his victory speech. The failure of the opinion polls was generally chalked up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">changes in telephone habits</a>, with the ensuing drop in response rates leading to poor quality data.
</li><li> The 2016 U.S. Senate election in Wisconsin featured incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in a rematch with former Democratic Senator Russ Feingold, whom he had defeated in 2010. Johnson had low approval ratings, no Republican had won a senate race in Wisconsin in a presidential election year since Bob Kasten in 1980<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p62q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p62q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p62q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wisconsin had only voted Republican for President once since when Reagan won a 49-state landslide; Class 2 of the Senate, which Wisconsin wasnt part of, was up that year</span> and after the GOP took control of the Senate in the 2014 elections the Wisconsin race became a top target for Democrats hoping to regain a majority. Feingold led by large margins in the polls and throughout the year, and most regarded Wisconsin as a safe pick up for the Democrats, with even Republicans thinking that their resources would be better used elsewhere, and cancelled over <a class="urllink" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/johnson-feingold-wisconsin-senate-race-2016-election-results-231027">$2 million in ad buys<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Johnson. In September, <a class="urllink" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeight-senate-forecast-the-map-favors-democrats-ever-so-slightly/">FiveThirtyEight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> referred to the contest as "[seeming as] close to a sure thing for Democrats" and gave Feingold a 94% chance of winning. In October, however, Johnson started to close the gap, but most polls and pundits still favored Feingold. On Election Day, to the surprise of almost everyone, Johnson ended up defeating Feingold by nearly 4% as Trump made a similar shocking victory.
</li><li> The death of Republican Pennsylvania Senator H. John Heinz III led to a special election to fill his seat in 1991. The Republican nominee Dick Thornburgh, a former governor and U.S. Attorney General, led the polls by 40 points over the Democratic nominee Harris Wofford, who had been appointed to fill the seat, and Pennsylvania Democrats thought that Governor Bob Casey, who appointed Wofford, wasted a chance to select a top tier candidate and had handed the seat back to the Republicans. However, similar to Dewey vs. Truman, Thornburgh focused mainly on avoiding mistakes and didn't aggressively campaign, which allowed Wofford to gain traction, mostly with working class voters. Wofford ultimately won the race by 10%.
</li><li> In 1980, 27-year old Chris Smith challenged longtime Democratic Congressman Frank Thompson of New Jersey. He had previously challenged Thompson in 1978 and lost 61%37%. He was thought to have no chance of winning, but then Thompson was indicted in the ABSCAM sting operation, where he was caught taking a bribe. The controversy of the scandal, combined with Ronald Reagan's strong performance in the district during the presidential election allowed Smith to defeat Thompson 57%41%. When Smith was up for reelection in 1982, many had dismissed his win as a fluke and expected the Democratic challenger, New Jersey Senate President Joseph P. Merlino, to win. After one of their debates, when Smith offered pleasantries Merlino rebuked him, saying "Beat it, kid." However, despite Democrats regaining many of the House seats lost in 1980, Smith managed to win reelection 53%-47%. As of 2019, Smith is still in office, having won at least 55% of the vote in each subsequent election.
</li><li> Over the last few years, Canadian polling companies have unfortunately gotten several provincial and municipal election outcomes spectacularly wrong.
<ul><li> 2012: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/alberta-s-election-polls-miss-the-mark-1.1206411">Alberta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and to a lesser extent <a class="urllink" href="http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/09/quebec-election-expectations-vs-results.html">Quebec<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

BC NDP campaign director Brian Topp wrote a <a class="urllink" href="http://punditsguide.ca/files/Topp_BC_Campaign_post-mortem_August_21_2013.pdf">post-mortem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about how the campaign went so wrong. Thankfully averted in the Nova Scotia provincial election eight months later, but that only lead to...
</li><li> 2014: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.threehundredeight.com/2014/06/ontario-election-post-mortem-likely.html">Ontario<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> 2017: The polls for the Calgary municipal elections were so wrong (projecting Bill Smith with a double-digit point lead over incumbent mayor Naheed Nenshi, only for Nenshi to defeat Smith by eight percentage points), that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/mria-investigation-polls-calgary-election-1.4375733">the polling industry actually launched an investigation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> into Mainstreet Research. There was another provincial election in B.C. as well, but for once, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grenier-bc-election-polls-1.4107727">the polls were dead on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, leading to another refreshing aversion in a province that desperately needed it.
</li></ul></li><li> Going into the 1992 UK general election, few gave the ruling Conservative Party any hope of clinging onto power, due to lingering resentment at former prime minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s catastrophically unpopular final years in power, replacement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnMajor">John Major</a>'s uncharismatic nature, and Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock having generally impressed since taking office. In the final weeks of the campaign, however, Major took to extensively campaigning in public (something Thatcher hadn't bothered much with in the previous two elections), while Labour organized a huge victory rally in Sheffield... over a week before election day. The end result of this was that Major came across as someone in touch with the public, whereas Kinnock seemed over-confident and overblown, and it led to the fourth Conservative majority government in a row, albeit with a substantially reduced majority.
</li><li> The 2015 UK election was essentially 1992 turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>; following five years of a not especially popular Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition government, most of the polls indicated that Conservative PM <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron">David Cameron</a> would almost certainly lose out to the Labour Party lead by Ed Milliband, and at best would be forced to continue in a coalition government with either the Liberal-Democrats or the UK Independence Party, who were rapidly taking over as the most popular third-party option. Instead, not only did Labour not win, they went down to their worst defeat since their infamously terrible showing in 1983, with the Conservatives surging into a relatively secure majority government, largely in part thanks to the Liberal-Democrat vote collapsing, and UKIP collecting a lot of votes, but winning only <em>one</em> seat.
</li><li> The 2016 referendum on the UKs membership in the European Union was assumed by many to be an automatic win for the remain side, particularly as the majority of Government officials were championing this. It was something of a surprise therefore when the leave campaign won with a slim majority. This created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman">Dewey Defeats Truman</a> moment as many newspapers had already gone to press with pro-EU headlines assuming Remain would win.
</li><li> Played with in the 2017 UK election.
<ul><li> From the start there was absolutely no doubt that the Conservative Party were going to win, and they ultimately did secure victory... but in a manner that no doubt felt like a defeat.
</li><li> The new Conservative leader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay">Theresa May</a> called a snap election on the back of record-breaking approval ratings for her government, and it was widely expected that at the very least the party would significantly extend the small majority that David Cameron had earned two years prior, with some even predicting they might match their all-time best performance from 1931.
</li><li> Everything seemed to be lining up for a big Tory win, with new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn having had low approval ratings since he took office, the Liberal-Democrats still being yet to recover from being nearly wiped out two years prior, and UKIP's vote having collapsed following a lengthy leadership crisis and a shambolic attempt to get their latest leader elected to parliament in a by-election.
</li><li> As a result, May did barely any campaigning for the election, refused to take part in the televised leadership debates on the implied grounds that she didn't think the other party leaders to be even worth acknowledging, and gave little more than vague soundbites when she did bother campaigning.
</li><li> Corbyn, meanwhile, put much more effort into his campaigning, coming across much better than expected. Still, the polls at first indicated an enormous Tory majority, and even after a late Labour surge they still looked good to extent their existing majority.
</li><li> Ultimately, the Tories did win the election, but not only with fewer seats than two years prior, but they lost enough seats to lose their majority in parliament, forcing them to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland to prop them up.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2018 US House elections, Rep. David Valadao was up by over 7% on election night and the AP and most major media outlets declared him the winner. Three weeks later, after counting the large volume of absentee ballots, his opponent TJ Cox pulled ahead by a few hundred votes and the AP issued a rare retraction and declared Cox the winner.
</li><li> Betsy Dirksen Londrigan was declared the winner of Illinois' 13th congressional district by CNN early on in election night. By the end of the night, they had to retract their projection after results showed it was still too close to call. Indeed, in the end, incumbent Rodney Davis narrowly held onto his seat.
</li><li> In 2019, longtime Democratic-aligned Wisconsin Judge Shirley Abrahamson announced she would retire after her terms expiration in April. The Democratic base rallied around Lisa Neubauer, who was supported by a large network of state and national left-wing organizations. The Republican was Brian Hagedorn, a little-known judge who conservative organizations were barely putting any effort into. After losing the election in the 2018 Supreme Court race by 10 points and all of their key statewide races during the November midterms, Wisconsin Republicans were demoralized and even they expected Neubauer to cruise to victory. Even a large realtor group who endorsed Hagedorn gave up on him about a month before the election due to concerns over some controversial views of his. Hagedorn was being outspent by about 14-to-1. What happened? The conservative base unexpectedly showed up. Many were outraged that Neubauers supporters decided to use what could be perceived as anti-Christian rhetoric to argue against Hagedorn during the campaign. Because of this, many decided to strike back against it and came out to support Hagedorn and drive him to a narrow victory.
</li><li> In late 2019, California congresswoman Katie Hill resigned after sexually explicit photos of her were leaked on the internet by her ex-boyfriend, and a special election was set up to fill the remainder of her term. Democrats quickly rallied by Assemblywoman Christy Smith, whose seat in the California State Assembly made up over half of the congressional district's population. The party was confident that, with the election coinciding with the Democratic presidential primary that March, she would get over 50% of the vote in the all-party primary and win the election outright. Unfortunately, those plans were complicated when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheYoungTurks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheYoungTurks">The Young Turks</a></em> host Cenk Uygur jumped into the race, and come March 3, he and several scattered Democrats caused Smith to fail to crack 40% of the vote. She was sent into a May runoff with Republican Navy veteran Mike Garcia, who edged out Hill's predecessor Steve Knight to win the seat. What was once considered a slam-dunk for Smith turned into a highly competitive race, and with the COVID-19 crisis beginning shortly afterwards, turnout was expected to be very low. The bottom fell out for Smith when she made a joke about Garcia's military service that alienated several voters in the military heavy district. Democratic turnout in the runoff was extremely low, as most Democratic voters were Latinos who rarely show up to the poll outside of November elections, and Garcia not only won, but he did so by nearly 10 percent margin. However, the rematch in November is expected to be highly competitive with high levels of turnout.
</li><li> Virtually ever prognosticator in 2018 expected Republican Rep. Steve Russell to easily hold onto his seat in Oklahoma's 5th congressional districton average polls had him <a class="urllink" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/oklahoma/5/">ahead by 13%<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In the end, Kendra Horn, his Demoratic challenger, tapped into anger at outgoing Republican Governor Mary Fallin's unpopular education policies and a strong performance at the top of the ticket by gubernatorial nominee Drew Edmondson to squeak out a 1-point win.
<ul><li> Zig-zagged in the 2020 Republican primary to take on Horn. Heading into round 1, State Senator Stephanie Bice was seen as nearly certain to be the first place finisher, with a good shot of winning the primary outright without the need for a runoff. However, Bice got forced into a runoff with businesswoman Terry Neese, and even more embarrassingly, came in second place with only 25%. Going into the August runoff, Neese was now considered a favorite to beat Bice, due to large levels of outside support from conservative organizations. However, shortly before the runoff, several scandals sunk Neese's support, and Bice came back and won by a sic-point margin. Because of Bice's win, national Republicans feel a lot more confident that they will win the seat back than they would have with Neese.

<ul><li> Going into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XLII, every sports analyst worth their salt said the 2007 New England Patriots were going to beat the New York Giants (who they'd beaten 38-35 in the regular season) and make themselves the first perfect team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins. The Patriots were 16-0 in the regular season, the first team in the history of the NFL to win every game of a 16-game season, and were being led by Tom Brady, already considered an excellent quarterback. The New York Giants, meanwhile, had limped into the playoffs at 10-6 as the first Wild Card team from the NFC, were being led by Eli Manning, who many thought wasn't as good as his older brother Peyton, and were noted to have several problems with their secondary. Many publications had already begun printing "19-0 Patriots" front pages before the game even started, since no one was giving the Giants a chance. Then the game was played, and the Giants pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">Miracle Rally</a> to win 17-14. Said front covers were then roundly mocked on sports websites, especially from Giants fans.
</li><li> This happened in the final round of the 1950 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a> in Brazil:
<ul><li> Following emphatic wins over Sweden and Spain in the final round robin group of four, red-hot favourites Brazil merely had to avoid losing their final match against second-placed Uruguay to win the World Cup. An impromptu carnival was held in Rio de Janeiro, with revellers holding signs already proclaiming Brazil the champions, and some 200,000 people packed into the Maracana Stadium to watch the match. FIFA president Jules Rimet prepared a Portuguese-language speech for the trophy presentation, the Brazilian Football Confederation struck 22 gold medals for the players (at the time, individual players did not receive winner's medals from FIFA), and a celebratory song called "Brazil the Victors" was written to be performed after the win.
</li><li> Then came the game itself... Friaça opened the scoring for Brazil just after half time, and the mostly Brazilian crowd went wild. Uruguay's Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalised twenty minutes later; the crowd spirit was dampened, but only temporarily as a draw still favoured Brazil. But then Alcides Ghiggia put Uruguay in front in the 79th minute, and the crowd went completely silent. Uruguay held on to win the match. Several Brazilian spectators either suffered heart attacks or jumped to their deaths from the top of the stadium, Rimet had to throw away his prepared speech and awkwardly hand over the trophy to Uruguayan captain Obdulio Varela with no ceremony, the winners' medals were melted down, and "Brazil the Victors" was never performed. The match is nicknamed the "Maracanazo", or "Maracanã Blow", in Latin America.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7e11k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7e11k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7e11k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The term is also used to refer to other underdog victories against Brazil in the Maracanã.</span> Many people claim that the pressure all day long by politicians and passerbys regarding the presumed victory certainly helped the Brazilian squad not perform as expected against an equally strong squad.
</li></ul></li><li> Four years later, the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland was expected to be taken by the "Golden Team" of Hungary, who hadn't lost since 1949 - a total of 36 games before the Cup. They started by trouncing North Korea 90 and West Germany 83 in the group phase, followed by hard contested 42 wins over both teams from the above game - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">violent quarterfinal</a> with Brazil and an overtime semifinal with Uruguay  and then a rematch with West Germany in the decision. Whose coach Sepp Herberger showed he was deliberately holding back the squad in the group stage, as Hungary scored twice in 8 minutes, Germany scored in ten more, and another goal in the final minutes crowned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a> over the seemingly unbeatable Magic Magyars.
</li><li> Arena Football, 2005 playoffs: Chicago trails Colorado by 3 on the final play of the game. Colorado intercepts Chicago's pass, and the confetti flies... but there's a penalty on the play on Colorado, so crew have to clean up the confetti before Chicago kicks in a game tying-field goal. Colorado cleans up in overtime with a touchdown. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZCckb2XYT8">Video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> During the 1985 World Series, the base of the trophy had allegedly been painted red for the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals. It had to be repainted blue for Kansas City Royals, who won the series in seven games.
</li><li> The 1986 World Series. Red Sox vs. Mets. Going into Game Six, the Red Sox were leading the series three games to two. The Red Sox pulled ahead, 5-3, in the top of the tenth inning, and after Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez flied out to left and center, respectively, it looked like they had it in the bag: the scoreboard at Shea Stadium briefly flashed "Congratulations, Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions", and TV announcers were remarking that Red Sox pitcher Bruce Hurst was about to be named Series MVP. And then, Gary Carter singled. Then pinch-hitter Kevin Mitchell also singled.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8lro2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8lro2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8lro2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mitchell had to be retrieved from the clubhouse because he had also assumed the Red Sox would win and had gone there to book a flight home.</span> Next up, Ray Knight singled on an 0-2 count, Carter ran home and Mitchell moved to third. Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi was pulled off the mound and replaced with Bob Stanley, who faced Mookie Wilson. Stanley gets worked to a 2-2 count because Wilson kept fouling off pitches, then throws a fastball so far inside it nearly beans Wilson and goes by the catcher to the backstop, allowing Knight move to second and Mitchell to score, tying the game. All of this was bad enough for the Red Sox fans, but what happened next is the event on which all the blame is pinned: Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first base, which went through first baseman Bill Buckner's legs. Knight scored, the Mets won 6-5, and the series gets tied 3-3, which forced a Game 7 (which the Mets won), turned Buckner's name into a curse word among Red Sox fans, and gave fuel to the idea that the Red Sox had been cursed.
</li><li> On November 17, 1968 at Shea Stadium, the New York Jets hosted the Oakland Raiders. In the fourth quarter, the Jets had regained the lead from a 29-29 tie score with a field goal, resulting in a 32-29 lead with 1:01 minute left. The NBC executives were unsure if the game would finish by 7 p.m. EST, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Heidi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Heidi">Heidi</a></em> was scheduled to begin. Viewers flooded the switchboards with calls, some asking that the game be shown to its conclusion, and others wondering if <em>Heidi</em> would start on time. The numerous phone calls prevented Don "Scotty" Connal and Dick Cline from getting in touch with each other. Just as Charlie Smith was returning the kickoff, the Eastern and Central time zone broadcasts of the game cut away to the opening minutes of Heidi, while Raiders QB Daryle Lamonica threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Smith for a 36-32 lead. As the Raiders kicked off to the Jets, Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line, followed by Preston Ridlehuber recovering the fumble and taking it into the end zone, giving the Oakland Raiders a 43-32 comeback victory.
</li><li> The 1978 Miracle at the Meadowlands. The New York Giants were up 17-12 with less than two minutes left in the game, the Philadelphia Eagles were out of timeouts, and the Giants just picked off a pass from Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski; the only thing the Giants had to do was run out the clock. Giants fans began streaming for the exits in a good mood, Eagles coach Dick Vermeil had a disgusted look on his face as he turned his attention to the post-game press conference (the team as a whole hadn't played that well that game), and (perhaps most strikingly) the CBS broadcast was already starting to having their announcers read off their list of "we thank this guy, this guy, that guy..." and rolling credits over the telecast. Then Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik fumbles the attempted handoff to Larry Csonka and Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards picks up the fumble for a touchdown. Eagles win, 19-17.
</li><li> The 2004 Copa América had Argentina scoring with three minutes left over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Brazil, and the adversary's broadcast was already accepting the defeat. And then Adriano <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">ties the game on injury time</a> to force the penalties, and Brazil wins there.
</li><li> The Brazilian volleyball team whisked away one of those to Russia, once for each gender, in a decisive match of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>. In 2004, the women's team was 24-19 on the fourth set of the semifinals, meaning they were only one point away from their first final... only to let the Russians turn over and then win the tiebreaker (the Brazilian girls were so affected that they hardly performed in the bronze medal match). In 2012, the men's team had two chances to win the final 3-0. Yet the Russians, buyoed by a tactical change that led Dmitriy Muserskiy to score 31 points overall, won that set, and the next two to win the gold.
</li><li> There's been more than one instance where fans of a home team who has fallen behind by a seemingly-insurmountable lead start leaving early in order to avoid get stuck in the inevitable post-game traffic jam in the parking lot, only to hear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">said team has come back</a> and they try to get back into the stadium. Amusingly enough, they're forbidden from re-entering because of long-standing policies printed on tickets regarding re-entrance to a facility after some time cutoff (at least initially - in such extreme cases the building managers may waive that policy and allow fans to reenter if they can act fast enough in terms of crowd control). Three well-known cases:
<ul><li> The Comeback, the 1993 NFL Wild Card win-or-go-home playoff game with the Houston Oilers visiting the Buffalo Bills. The Oilers dominated the first half, with quarterback Warren Moon going 19-for-22 for 218 yards and 4 touchdowns (excellent quarterback stats for a whole game, never mind half of one) en route to a 28-3 lead at halftime; then less than two minutes into the third quarter Bills quarterback Frank Reich threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown, putting the Oilers up 35-3 and prompting Houston's radio announcer to remark, "The lights are on here at Rich Stadium, they've been on since this morning, you could pretty much turn them out on the Bills right now." Between having their top two offensive stars sidelined by injury<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9hnaa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9hnaa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9hnaa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> normal starting quarterback Jim Kelly had been injured the previous game <em>at Houston</em> and running back Thurman Thomas had been injured on the initial second-half drive that ended with the Houston pick-six</span>, how feebly the healthy Bills players were playing, and the chilly Western New York weather, the fans largely agreed, throwing invectives at Bills General Manager Bill Polian as they streamed out of the stadium en masse. Then the Bills finally came to life, going touchdown, onside-kick en route to a touchdown, quick defensive stop then touchdown, and intercepting Moon followed by a touchdown - in less than seven minutes of play 35-3 became 35-31. It took until late in the fourth quarter for the Bills to finally take the lead at 38-35, but by then the previously-pissed patrons had received word of the rally via radio and came back for The Comeback, climbing over the fences to get back to their seats in many cases while suddenly singing praises about the team within earshot of Bill Polian. Oh, and the Bills won 41-38 in overtime.
</li><li> The 2000 Monday Night Miracle, the Miami Dolphins at the New York Jets. By the end of the 3rd quarter the Dolphins were up 30-7, Jets radio broadcaster Howard David stated, "And with a whole quarter to go, this game is over", and fans either began chanting "Let's go Yankees"/"Let's go Mets" (the game took place between Games 2 and 3 of the 2000 World Series between those two teams) or just left Giants Stadium early to beat traffic. Then the Jets scored 23 unanswered points to tie the game at 30 - the Dolphins scored another touchdown to go back up by seven, then the Jets scored <em>again</em> to tie it again at 37; fans who had left early began turning around and tried to get back into the stadium after hearing about the comeback on their car radio. The Jets won 40-37 in overtime.
</li><li> Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals, the San Antonio Spurs visting the Miami Heat with the Spurs up 3 games to 2 in the series. With 28 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Spurs up 94-89, fans began streaming out of American Airlines Arena while league officials began preparing the security tape for what seemed to be a Spurs championship. The Heat managed to tie the game and send it into overtime, at which point TV cameras outside the arena filmed fans trying to reenter after having left and being blocked by security from doing so. The Heat won the game 103-100 and eventually won the NBA championship two nights later.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2016 World Series. The Cleveland Indians had a commanding 3-1 lead over the Chicago Cubs after the first four games. One overenthusiastic Indians fan chose to tattoo himself with both the Indians and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">Cleveland Cavaliers'</a> logo with a caption proclaiming a 2016 victory for both of them. Then the Cubs won Game 5 at Wrigley Field, followed by Game 6 and 7 back in Cleveland to become the 2016 World Series Champions.
<ul><li> Ironically, the Cavaliers themselves were on the opposite side of this trope as they were losing 3-1 to the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals until they managed a come-from-behind championship win with 3 straight victories.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> LI, the Atlanta Falcons were up 28-3 against the New England Patriots with about two minutes left in the third quarter; at one point, the Falcons had a 99.8% chance of winning, according to ESPN analysts. Stores across Atlanta were already stocking the shelves with Falcons Super Bowl Champions merchandise. Cue the fourth quarter, in which the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to force the game into overtime for the first time in Super Bowl history, as well as the second time that an NFL championship game went into overtime since the 1958 NFL Championship Game. The Patriots would end up scoring the game-winning touchdown on their first drive, defeating the Falcons 34-28.
</li><li> During the second round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, Puerto Rico managed to defeat the United States in a narrow 6-5 game during their undefeated run to the championship game. With them set to play the USA again, the Puerto Ricans already began preparing for a championship win with customized t-shirts, a booked flight back to the island, and a parade in San Juan. Team USA caught wind of this and the players were <em>not</em> happy. They proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">embarrass</a> Puerto Rico with a 8-0 win that included USA starter Marcus Stroman, who incidentally faced jeers from PR fans and players for choosing to play for the USA instead of them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10vv35');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10vv35" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10vv35');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> His mother was born in Puerto Rico making him eligible for their team along with the US, where he was born.</span>, pitching a no-hitter until the seventh inning.
</li><li> During game 3 of their second round series against the Boston Celtics in the 2018 NBA playoffs, the Philadelphia 76ers scored a buzzer-beater at the end of the fourth quarter. The problem? The refs had to check whether it was a 2-point shot (which would tie), or a 3-point shot (which would win the game), and some of the employees at Philadelphia's arena presumed it was the latter, so they ended up firing off several confetti cannons. It ended up being a two-point shot, resulting in a short delay before overtime for cleanup. Unfortunately, Boston ended up winning.
</li><li> Any best-of-seven playoff series in which one team has won the first three games is generally considered an assumed win, because the team with the 3-0 lead almost always wins the series. <em>Almost.</em> As of June 2018, there have been only five instances in the North American major leagues when a team has come back from an 0-3 deficit to win a series (often by finishing the sweep); four of those have been in the NHL, and it has yet to happen in the NBA:
<ul><li> 1942 Stanley Cup Finals: The Detroit Red Wings became the first team in history to blow a 3-0 lead, losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Leafs had a lead toward the end of Game 4 when the Wings objected to penalties assessed, culminating in Detroit head coach Jack Adams punching the referee and getting suspended from the remainder of the series. The Wings nearly returned the favor on the Leafs in 1945, but fell short in Game 7.
</li><li> 1975 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals: The New York Islanders rebounded to defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins, and then nearly repeated the feat in the Semifinals, forcing Game 7 against the Philadelphia Flyers before losing to the defending (and eventual repeat) Cup champions.
</li><li> 2004 American League Championship Series: the Boston Red Sox were dominated by the New York Yankees in the first three games, but after coming back to win Games 4 and 5 in extra innings and winning Game 6 on pitcher Curt Schilling's torn tendon (the "Bloody Sock Game"), the Sox blew the Yankees out in Game 7, and then went on to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, putting an end to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse of the Bambino</a>.
</li><li> 2010 Stanley Cup Eastern Conference Semifinals: The Flyers came back on the Boston Bruins to win the series, and even came back from a 3-0 deficit within Game 7 by a final score of 4-3. Philadelphia would reach the Finals, only to lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.
</li><li> 2014 Stanley Cup Western Conference Quarterfinals: The Los Angeles Kings came back on the San Jose Sharks to advance out of the first round, and went on to win their second Cup in three years.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted by the 2017-18 Philadelphia Eagles. After starting QB and likely NFL MVP Carson Wentz suffered a season-ending injury in Week 14, the team's chances of championship contention looked grim at best. Confidence decreased even further when the Eagles nearly lost to the New York Giants and the Oakland Raiders (two non-contending teams) and got shut out by the Dallas Cowboys (another non-contending team). This turn of events earned the '17 Eagles the infamous distinction of being the first #1 seed in NFL history not to be favored in their opening postseason game. The rest was history, as they not only won that game against the Atlanta Falcons, but also went on to defeat the Minnesota Vikings and the New England Patriots in route to their first-ever Super Bowl championship.
</li><li> A major joke going into the 2019 NBA playoffs was "which team will be the one to lose to the Golden State Warriors?" Given the Warriors had been in the last four Finals with three of them victories made them the obvious favorites. Most assumed the only team that had a chance for an upset was the Milwaukee Bucks only for them to lose the Eastern Conference finals to the Toronto Raptors. Thus, many openly predicted a Warriors sweep in the Finals. Instead, the Raptors defeated the Warriors in six games to win their first NBA title.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>:
<ul><li> As they were announcing the new #1 contender for the WWE Championship, John Cena stood up, assuming he won (justified as he had by far won the fan poll), only for Kurt Angle to say "John... Bradshaw Layfield!"
</li><li> Another time a feud started between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and Sid Justice because Hogan was named #1 contender for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>'s title, in a press conference where Justice stood up as the announcement was being made.
</li></ul></li><li> At the 2012 Olympics, reigning women's vault world champion McKayla Maroney was expected to win the women's vault title easily, an expectation that was only solidified after Maroney qualified into the vault final in first place by nearly half a point (a significant margin in gymnastics) and then hit an epic vault in the team final two days later. During the vault final, Maroney fell on her second vault and ended up finishing in silver medal position. Her reaction to this turn of events (which probably wouldn't have been so unpleasant for her if not for the extent to which everyone expected her to win gold) <a class="urllink" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/mckayla-maroney-gets-mckayla-not-impressed-meme-194637045--oly.html">became legendary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> An apocryphal Real Life story: After an 1883 chess tournament, a toast was proposed "to the best player in the world." Both Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort stood up to thank the toastmaster. In 1886, Steinitz defeated Zukertort to become the first World Champion.
</li><li> During the 1933 Academy Awards, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankCapra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankCapra">Frank Capra</a> and Frank Lloyd were up for the award for Best Director (Capra for <em>Lady for a Day</em>, Lloyd for <em>Calvacade</em>). When presenter Will Rogers said, "Come up and get it, Frank", both Lloyd and Capra went up to accept the Oscar. Much to Capra's chagrin, <em>Lloyd</em> was the real winner. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOscar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOscar">The Oscar</a></em>, see above, may be a reference to this.)
</li><li> Entering the 1997 Oscar ceremony, <em>everyone</em> took it for granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall">Lauren Bacall</a> would win Best Supporting Actress. It wasn't that her role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirrorHasTwoFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirrorHasTwoFaces">The Mirror Has Two Faces</a></em> was that notable but rather in recognition of her long career as a Hollywood star. Some papers even noted she was a lock in their "choose the Oscars" contests. Thus, it was a massive shock when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietteBinoche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietteBinoche">Juliette Binoche</a> had her name called for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnglishPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnglishPatient">The English Patient</a></em>. While Bacall seemed calm, the other three nominees were open-mouthed and wide-eyed. Binoche herself looked more shocked than anyone as she headed to the stage. She noted she hadn't even bothered preparing anything as she was as convinced as anyone else Bacall would win this.
</li><li> The 2006 Country Music Awards saw Faith Hill and Carrie Underwood both nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year. As the nominations were being announced, a camera was trained on all five finalists, including Hill and Underwood. Then, as Underwood was announced the winner, Hill smiled and raised her arms, then apparently screamed "What?" and stormed away. All of this was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZRiEJnIag">caught on live television<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> just before the nominee camera shots were pulled away. Faith Hill and her management insisted the act was a joke, but left many unconvinced. Her career nosedived not long after.

When the winner was announced, the presenters' voices were garbled and the band began playing <em>All My Children</em>'s theme. With numerous people pointing at her, Susan Lucci assumed she was the winner and began to walk on stage. Problem is, it was FLANNERY who had won. Luckily, Lucci was able to back off the stage before appearing on-camera. And even luckier, she had finally won her elusive Emmy several years prior, otherwise the incident would have been much more embarrassing for all involved.
</li><li> <em>Australia's Next Top Model</em> had a related incident when they actually announced the wrong person as the winner, and she'd already done her acceptance speech when the host revealed that in fact, the other finalist had won.
</li><li> Inverted in an Airdrie, Alberta, Canada high school. A student, convinced he would not win a cash award for attendance, declined to attend the draw and stayed in class instead. Then the teacher got a call over the school phone network, and sent the student down to the stadium—the student had won a $1,000 draw.
</li><li> Heading into the 2015 awards season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> was so confident in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie">The LEGO Movie</a></em>'s front-runner status that a day before the Oscar nominations were announced, it released <a class="urllink" href="https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10422534_716931105071985_6517897082783138493_n.png?oh=332523a362af52fa3804f9e0d6dd1b65&amp;oe=552BC120">an internet banner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> celebrating the movie's assumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAwardForBestAnimatedFeature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAwardForBestAnimatedFeature">best animated film</a> nomination. Warner wasn't alone - most Oscar prognosticators had the film as the favorite to <em>win</em>. When the nominations were announced the next morning, <em>The Lego Movie</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">not among them</a>.
</li><li> The 2015 Miss Universe Pageant. At the end of the pageant host Steve Harvey accidentally labeled Ariadna Gutiérrez, Miss Columbia as the winner of the pageant. The real winner was Pia Wurtzbach, Miss Philippines. The mistake was corrected but not before Steve Harvey had to apologize for his mistake, and Gutiérrez was de-crowned on camera, all while the credits were rolling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand">La La Land</a></em> being erroneously declared Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards was this on two fronts. The film was the heavy favorite to win, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonlight2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonlight2016">Moonlight</a></em> a distant second. Nearly all forecasts predicted <em>La La Land</em> would win, and most betting sites placed its odds of winning at over 80%. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/22/14691028/oscar-predictions-best-picture-la-la-land">Vox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> stated, "If <em>La La Land</em> loses Best Picture, it will be the biggest Oscars upset ever." <a class="urllink" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oscar-voting-is-engineered-to-favor-movies-like-la-la-land/">FiveThirtyEight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> placed its odd of winning at 82% and noted that with the Best Picture category's rank-choice voting system, "The Oscars are already rigged in favor of movies like <em>La La Land</em>." Earlier in the ceremony, Damien Chazelle won the Best Director award for <em>La La Land</em>, which statistically predicts the Best Picture winner 71% of the time. Best Picture presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the winner as <em>La La Land</em> to the surprise of few, and the cast and crew had congregated on the stage and two of the producers had finished their acceptance speeches when it was discovered Beatty and Dunaway had mistakenly been given the envelope for Best Actress, which Emma Stone had won for <em>La La Land</em>, and <em>Moonlight</em> had in fact won Best Picture. The cast and crew of <em>La La Land</em> then had to clear off the stage as the producers of <em>Moonlight</em> accepted the award to a stunned audience.
<ul><li> The good thing about this is this retroactively vindicated Marisa Tomei's Oscar, which many had thought had been won erroneously, and the Academy was too embarrassed to correct the error. If it had been in error, they would have corrected it like they did in this case.
</li></ul></li><li> At the 2019 Academy Awards, roughly 99 percent of predictions chose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlennClose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GlennClose">Glenn Close</a> as the lock for Best Actress. Her role in <em>The Wife</em> had already earned her a Golden Globe, a Critic's Choice award and the Screen Actors Guild award which almost always predicted the Oscar winner. Add in that it was Close's seventh nomination without any wins and her coronation appeared assured. Instead, in a stunning upset, the prize was claimed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaColman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaColman">Olivia Colman</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFavourite">The Favourite</a></em>. Granted, Colman had also won a Globe and Critic's Choice along with a BAFTA but most were rocked that Close's supposed surefire victory didn't happen.
</li><li> Also at the 2019 Academy Awards, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a></em> won the best animated film award, which doesn't seem like too big a deal... until shortly after, where images started circulating from stores where it turned out Disney had pre-emptively printed stickers to promote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RalphBreaksTheInternet">Ralph Breaks the Internet</a></em> as the winner of the award, and sold them to stores to use in their shelves—and most stores did, indeed, have no choice but to either throw out the stickers, or to just display them anyways (which some stores did). Whoops.
<ul><li> This was baffling to many given that <em>Spider-Verse</em> was clearly the heavy favorite to win, having already earned several precursor awards like the Golden Globe so Disney thinking <em>Ralph</em> was a sure winner seemed off.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, in September 2019, some bookshops displayed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTestaments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTestaments">The Testaments</a></em> with stickers saying "Winner: The Booker Prize 2019". With a month to go before the actual announcement, the Booker committee had to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/booker-prize-stresses-2019-winner-remains-undecided-after-bookshop-error-1081731">issue a statement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> saying it had not already made its decision. As it turned out, the stickers were right. (Well, first ever joint win, with <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em> by Bernardine Evaristo.)
