Especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">no one believes that you're sincere about it</a>, and/or won't forgive willingly.
</p><p>This is the companion trope to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain">Falsely Reformed Villain</a>, who pretends to have reformed, but in reality is only biding his time while he plots his latest nefarious scheme. The hero, however, is not fooled. By contrast, the desire of the Reformed, But Rejected character to leave his evil ways in the past is completely genuine — but the hero still refuses to be "fooled."
</p><p>Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>, this character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">not necessarily overwhelmingly evil</a>, and it is easier if he hasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">gone completely overboard</a>. His sins could be more along the lines of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">stole some bread</a>" or "robbed a bank", than "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroyed ten inhabited planets</a> and built pyramids of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls">skulls</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">laughing wildly</a>." Whatever the case, he is generally not of the opinion that he needs to spend the rest of his life and possibly his afterlife as well trying to make up for his misdeeds, and is in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicProtection">due some good karma</a>. All he wants is a chance at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">normal honest life</a>. It's getting people to give him that chance that presents a problem.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Often the disinclination to believe that a character has truly become good is not limited to just the hero or heroes, but is the reaction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">society in general</a>. The reformed character can find this a bitter pill to swallow, particularly if they have "done their time" in prison or paid their debt to society in some other way, yet find that society is not prepared to let bygones be bygones.
</p><p>On the other hand, there are times where this reaction may be totally reasonable. A long history of being a complete jerk and general thorn in the side of the heroes does not really do much to engender popularity with them. The villain may really want to reform and may have taken honest steps to do so, but the heroes may simply just be so sick of dealing with them and the messes that they cause (<em>especially</em> if they already have multiple failed attempts on their record) that they frankly just don't care. Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a>, it runs the gamut from a cheap excuse to avoid taking responsibility, to an explanation that has some truth but still doesn't cut it, and all the way to a perfectly valid reason where the heroes are completely in the wrong and really have no one but themselves to blame.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In the best case, the reformed character finds the strength of will to withstand the scorn and derision of the heroes and/or society at large, and is eventually able to prove themselves truly changed despite the enormous pressure. They succeed in making a place for themselves in honest society, however humble that place may be. (They may even realize that their previous attempts were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff">Buy Them Off</a> and, if not spending the rest of their lives atoning, do more to make up for what they did.)
</p><p>In the worst case, the pressure is too much and the reformed character's resolve falters and fails. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy">He returns to his old bad ways</a>, often ending up in jail again. He may even become so despairing that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">takes his own life</a> rather than live with non-stop contempt and derision. To rub salt in it, the heroes might take this as proof that he really had never changed at all, and in the case of bad writing, this will be how the story interprets it.
</p><p>This character is prone to attracting the attention of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a>, who is convinced that "men like you can never change." Javert is likely to hound the character non-stop, hoping to catch him in a criminal act, or possibly in the most extreme cases even goad him into committing one.
</p><p>The greatest danger for a Reformed But Rejected character, however, is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a>, but bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">karma</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">It might be safer to just stay bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEarnsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEarnsLife">though the opposite may happen too</a>.
</p><p>A character who reforms in a particularly unsubtle way and does not face rejection and scorn afterward, but instead finds the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">welcoming him with open arms and perhaps a nice cake</a>, has undergone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a>.
</p><p>A subtrope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology">Rejected Apology</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccuserOfTheBrethren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccuserOfTheBrethren">Accuser of the Brethren</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">The Farmer and the Viper</a>, where someone given the opportunity this reformer seeks turns it against his benefactors or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection">Redemption Rejection</a> where a villain is offered a chance to reform only for the villain to refuse. Also contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> where a formerly villainous character is quickly forgiven for any crimes they may have committed as soon as they start helping the good guys, no matter how serious they were. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam">HeelFace Door-Slam</a>, where the villain never even gets to start their journey to redemption (or attempts to but is rebuffed because their old actions really were too far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">beyond the pale</a> for anything resembling a convincing redemption in the authors eyes at least); <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionFailure">Redemption Failure</a>, where they embark on said journey but are turned around by external forces half-way through; and finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenessRequiresDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenessRequiresDeath">Forgiveness Requires Death</a>, where the price to earn the forgiveness of the wronged person is one's own life. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet">Villain Ball Magnet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy">Trapped in Villainy</a>. May result from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActMisunderstanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActMisunderstanding">Third-Act Misunderstanding</a>. If the heroes did forgive him, but still give him this sort of treatment, then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten">Forgiven, but Not Forgotten</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegretfulTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegretfulTraitor">Regretful Traitor</a> may be a victim of this, since they genuinely regret having betrayed their friends, but the betrayal may have cut too deep for their friends to forgive them.

After meeting the superhero Earth-chan, he attempted to reform, but ended up drifting back to the Diamond Eaters because they were the only ones who respected him and his abilities. Judas eventually decided to turn good for real, turning on the Diamond Eaters and serving time in prison for his past crimes, but Earth-chan views him as an incorrigible villain and refuses to believe his reformation is genuine.

This was especially true when he used Wormmon to kill a rampaging Thundermon, rather than calming or trapping it. Then they learn in the next episode that the rogue Thundermon was actually created from a Control Spire and they start trusting him more (though Iori/Cody still refuses to completely accept him until the World Tour arc).

Aside from Goku and Bulma, not one of the other Z-Fighters can stand him and have no qualms against informing him as such to his face, not that he really gives a damn what they think. Case in point: after Vegeta is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomped</a> by Perfect Cell, Krillin tells him point-blank that he's <em>only</em> helping him for Trunks' sake and wouldn't care one bit if Vegeta <em>did</em> die. It's justified; even if he was technically on their side, Vegeta was still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">self-absorbed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a>.

General incredulity is quelled after he unexpectedly appears in the talent show in a silly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> with a guitar and sings a heartwarming song about acceptance, but the main characters remain suspicious despite his total adorableness. Subverted in that just around the time the reader starts to like him, he seemingly betrays them, only to turn out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent">Double Agent</a> who was on their side the entire time.
</li><li> Jellal gets the same treatment. It takes a multiple chapters to convince the only person likely to still have any faith in his ability to turn over a new leaf that he's developed amnesia and believes from the bottom of his heart that he needs to help her cause. Granted, once she accepts him he starts to get a little more slack (barring needing to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">shot to the gut</a> to convince Natsu to accept a powerup to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>), until the new council says they don't care that he has amnesia and became good or that Nirvana would still be rampaging were it not for his aid and arrests him anyway.

However, the only work offers he gets are for supervillain jobs. When he uncovers evidence of a truly evil plot, he takes what he has learned to the city's superheroes but is repeatedly rejected, scorned, and attacked. After many difficulties, he eventually manages to stop the actual villain, proving himself capable of true heroism in the process. While this does not make him beloved of the city's heroes or citizens, it earns him enough elbow room from them to start building a new life for himself.

</li><li> Another old comic had Batman opposing the ruling of the parole board and tracking the Penguin mercilessly. But when Batman cracks down on his suspicious-looking business, he discovers (to his chagrin) that the operation was almost legitimate... except for the security, who were fellow ex-cons that the Penguin had hired as a favour, to help them gain employment. Sadly, though, this violation of parole means that the Penguin has to return to prison... but Batman puts in a good word for him this time. (The Penguin's love interest also happens to be a honest woman.)

However, after the holocaust that destroyed Crown City, his body was discovered by the roaming wildebots of the plains, who gave him new life as a cyborg and gave him perspective on the harshness of his actions as Emperor. His daughter, Princess Omaka, refuses to recognize him as a changed man; this is partially because he killed her mother and her brother and burned her arms off when he was king. Skaar, the son of Hulk, is much more understanding, but possibly only because he wasn't alive to see the horrors Red King wrought as planetary leader.

While Ladybug is ready to welcome back her partner with open arms after his heartfelt apology, Emerald Shell is grudging at best - he doesn't like him or trust him, but he's willing to work with him and see if he's serious about fixing the mess he created.

Akumatized Victims Anonynmous take it to the point of spraying insulting and threatening graffiti all over the city and burning him in effigy during a protest at City Hall.

A number of villains take this opportunity to become heroes, but the majority of the unpowered population oppose this, especially the anti-cape contingent. It's explained in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward">Ward</a></em>, that the opposition feel that A, since the unpowered weren't consulted when capes decided to establish the amnesty, they don't have to accept villains becoming heroes just because the capes say so; and B, the amnesty essentially allows many villains who were never arrested or convicted of their crimes to get away with said crimes, even those who'd killed or inflicted large amounts of damage. However, they also oppose villains-turned-heroes who <em>did</em> serve time for their crimes and are truly repentant, which somewhat undermines their points.

<ul><li> Even after his attempts at redemption, Spike is almost never really trusted by the Scoobies, who continually hound him with abuse and scorn. On the other hand, 120 years of him killing for fun.
<ul><li> When he was originally forced to beg for their help, he spent a lot of time telling them how much he hated them and how he was going to kill them all, first chance he got. The abuse and scorn weren't exactly one-sided. Even when he started trying to be what Buffy wanted, some of his attempts were... off, and the gang knew quite well that he was motivated by feelings for Buffy rather than a genuine desire for redemption. There's a difference. Even if he was planning not to repeat his past evil actions, he didn't actually feel remorse for them.
</li><li> Even after Spike gets his soul, Xander remains wary of him (the years of antagonism between the two of them not going away that simply) while Giles spends a good amount of Season 7 dismissive of his capacity for change and instead criticizes Buffy for leaning so closely on Spike as an ally. It gets to the point where Giles, worried about the consequences of the First Evil's brainwashing effect on Spike (and annoyed that Buffy removed the chip in Spike's head after it started malfunctioning instead of installing a new one), decided to help Robin Wood in his attempt to kill Spike rather than trust that the vampire had the capacity to overcome the trigger.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, there's a lot of confusion about just how responsible vampires are for their actions. When soulless Angel kills Ms. Calendar, it's made arguably clear that Angel wasn't responsible, his evil counterpart Angelus was. This line gets a lot more blurred around Spike, because he doesn't even get a soul until the seventh season, by which point he's insane and being manipulated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> anyway, so there's even less reason to trust him.
</li><li> Faith is an interesting case in that she seems to have genuinely reformed post coma, being genuinely nice to Buffy in a dream sequence and telling her how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">stop the ascension</a>.

After Faith gets her own body back, she runs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">to LA</a>, where she goes on a rampage and tortures Wesley in a bid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">be killed by Angel</a>. He instead sees it as a cry for help and tries to put her on the path of redemption, however Buffy is having none of that and comes to town, still holding a grudge and intent on killing her.

Rick snapped, took a gun to school, paralyzed one of the students who bullied him previously, then died after a struggle with another student from his own gun. To be fair the hatred of Rick came mostly from the fact that he abused his girlfriend and started stalking her after she finally broke up with him.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Discord</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the season 2 premiere, is reformed by Fluttershy the following season, but she's the only person that gives him an honest shot, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionFailure">Redemption Failure</a> at the end of season four where he joins up with that episode's villain. Ironically, it's the aftermath of <em>this</em> that finally makes the others accept him.
</li><li> Despite turning over a new leaf at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E5MagicDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E5MagicDuel">"Magic Duel"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Trixie</a> notices that other ponies still avoid her and whisper about her past deeds behind her back. It also turns out that Twilight wasn't quite as forgiving to Trixie as she originally let on, though as she states when called out on it, she claims this is more to do with the fact that Trixie <em>still</em> kinda acts like a smug jerk towards her.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a>,</em> Sideshow Bob, after one of his many stints in prison, has legitimately reformed. However, Bart and Lisa don't believe it (with good reason, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalselyReformedVillain">past experience</a>), and when Bob's brother's plot is foiled, they both get taken away to jail. Since the brothers are played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">and David Hyde-Pierce</a> we can be sure that they'll have plenty to talk about in jail.
<p></p></li><li> Jonsey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen">6teen</a></em>, when the Underground Video store was in trouble!
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Tobey Goes Good", Tobey appears to have legitimately reformed but is eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy">pushed back to the brink of villainy</a>, confirming Word Girl's belief of his insincerity. He later claims "I hadn't changed into a <em>no-good do-gooder!</em> It doesn't pay to be nice!"
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a> Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy has attempted reform in at least three episodes, "Chuck the Nice Pencil Selling Guy", "Chuck Makes a Buck" &amp; "Lunchlady Chuck." Subverted somewhat in that WordGirl doesn't reject him (indeed, she encourages him to reform), but some other factor causes him to become evil again (In the first, he tries to kill his boss, played by the late Peter Graves, when he finds out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">that he hates sandwiches</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">In a cruel twist, it's revealed at the end that the guy liked grilled cheese, but was unaware it was a type of sandwich, meaning Chuck went back to crime for nothing</a>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The Apprentice" episode, no one but Omi believes that Jack is really on the good side. It's revealed later that he didn't think any of the monks, Omi included, believed he could be good, even though his change was genuine, and he returned to being evil because he was afraid he would fail, as per everyone's expectations.
</li><li> When Chase Young used a Shen Gong Wu to induce Omi into becoming Heylin, Kimiko commented, not knowing the truth about the Wu, that she'd expect Raimundo to betray them (as he had done before in Season One). Raimundo didn't take offense.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similar to Spike in <em>Buffy</em>, Avalanche once tried to join the good guys to get closer to Kitty, but Logan and Scott end up blaming him for some recent Joyrides. Justified however, in that Avalanche did everything he could to make them <em>not</em> trust him: He failed two tests on purpose for the sake of annoying Scott/showing off to Kitty, taunted Scott after his car was trashed and though he knew who <em>was</em> joyriding, didn't even try to defend himself from the accusations. Considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">way he always acted towards him</a>, Scott's attitude and mild hazing is understandable and, while often forgotten, he <em>did</em> try to give him a chance at first but was put off by the fact that Lance was still fairly antagonistic towards him, and in he end apologized for acting unfairly. Not like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Brotherhood fans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">will remember that detail</a>. Still, at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Lance did honestly try to help eventually</a>.
</li><li> Rogue inverted this trope in <em>Evolution</em>, refusing to trust the X-Men for most of season 1 for what she <em>thought</em> was a series of attacks on her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">These were staged by Mystique</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> After WWII, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis">a lot of people still hate Germans or call them Nazis</a>, much to the chagrin of people who were never involved with the atrocities. This is true even if their parents and grandparents weren't involved, either. Basically, the whole country is trying to put the past behind them and Germans are still embarrassed if their flag is put on display for whatever reason, as WWII resulted from national pride.
<p></p></li><li> Critics of publicly accessible criminal registries tend to cite this trope as a major contributor to high recidivism rates in jurisdictions that use them. Effectively, a criminal registry (and potential legal requirements to inform new acquaintances, romantic partners, or employers of their criminal past) can severely limit employment and socialization prospects for ex-convicts, even those who legitimately want to turn over a new leaf and are trying hard to do so.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> wrote an article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2366-shady-people-put-my-mugshot-online-extorted-me-money.html">exposing the existence of an entire industry that abuses this trope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, extorting people to have their mugshots removed (sometimes charging <em>per picture</em>) even if they'd been acquitted or even had the charges dismissed — in the case of the interviewee, on the grounds of mental instability.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> During the nineties, David Brock was, by his own admission, an attack dog for the Republican Party, authoring <em>The Real Anita Hill</em>, which argued that Anita Hill was deluded when she accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. However, in 1997, he suddenly switched parties, becoming a Democrat, releasing a largely sympathetic biography of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, and later going on to found the unabashedly liberal Media Matters for America. While he's become very influential in the Democratic Party thanks to Media Matters, many rank-and-file progressives have not forgotten about his past behavior, and have not forgiven him for it.
<p></p></li><li> In his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">Il Principe</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> explicitly advocated caution towards former opponents who switched sides, because "someone who betrayed trust of his former allies may as well do the same to you".
<p></p></li><li> It is not unheard of for school bullies to meet their victims in public many years later and apologize for their actions towards them. Sometimes the victim will refuse to forgive them and still think they're same rotten jerk that they knew back then, since the painful memories won't let them forget what happened. Similarly, internet trolls or those that engaged in cyberbullying may have a change of heart and find themselves being completely shunted by their former victims.
<p></p></li><li> One could make the case that this trope extends to many a felon who has "served his time" in jail. While they are technically free, they will find themselves ineligible or at the bottom of the résumé list for a large number of jobs, since with a large pool of applicants, many companies will first whittle the list down by rejecting all ex-cons before an interview is scheduled. The lack of availability of work prospects drives many back to a life of crime.
<p></p></li><li> Superstar QB Michael Vick, who was the most despised athlete in the country after he was jailed for two years for illegal dogfighting, in which Vick aided in both running a dogfighting circle and in the deaths of some dogs themselves. After his stint, Vick offered remorse in that he said he grew up in a "Dirty South" culture where it was not seen or understood as wrong and promised to use his experience to educate others in that culture about the inhumanity of dogfighting. Many felt he did not deserve a chance to go back into the NFL. Vick has managed to earn back the good graces of a lot of fans due to his cleaned-up behavior and work with the American Humane Society and his improbable revival of his career, becoming an even <em>better</em> QB than he was before jail. However, there is still a contingent of fans (especially in Atlanta, where Vick's departure sunk the franchise for a few years) who feel Vick will never change and/or does not deserve his second-chance opportunity.
<p></p></li><li> This was the case when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan">Frank Abagnale</a> was originally released in that he wasn't trusted by anyone. One of his first jobs after being released from prison was at a supermarket. When he was about to be promoted to assistant manager, the store did a background check and immediately fired him. Fortunately for him, he was able to turn this into a career in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedCriminal">he began consulting as a fraud investigator for local businesses</a>. This ultimately turned into an international business for him.
