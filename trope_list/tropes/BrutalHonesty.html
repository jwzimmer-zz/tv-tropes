<p></p><div class="indent"><em>When counseling her patients about the wisdom of truth-telling, my colleague Lisa Spiegel uses a simple and effective formula: Ask yourself, is it honest, is it helpful, and is it kind? Truth can also be irrevocably destructive and even aggressive, delivered with sadistic pleasure. On more than one occasion, Ive seen honesty do more harm than good, leaving me to ask, Can lying sometimes be protective? [] Sometimes silence is caring. Before you unload your guilt onto an unsuspecting partner, consider, whose well-being are you really thinking of? Is your soul-cleansing as selfless as it appears? And what is your partner supposed to do with this information?</em>

<ul><li> Takahama goes before Sasaki, the editor in chief of Shonen Jump to ask to get a new editor because he believes that his editor, Miura, won't let him draw what he wants. Sasaki responds that saying that is the same as admitting his own lack of talent, and that no artists, whether veterans or rookies, can change editors. He suggests that Takahama go elsewhere if he's dissatisfied, but Takahama, chastened, withdraws his request and apologizes. Mashiro and Takagi note that what the editor said was harsh, but he had a point and they should stop blaming Miura.
</li><li> In Sasaki's first appearance, he tells Mashiro and Takagi that their youth isn't what's keeping them from being published- it's that their manga submissions aren't good enough.

Thus, Light is taken completely by surprise when his classmate, "Hideki Ryuga", bluntly admits that he's L. Light is then rendered speechless when L follows up by declaring he suspects that Light is Kira.

He also lists of all of Yami's negative qualities to Asta to show his familiarity with him. Later, he states the Black Bulls' members' flaws to their face, all of which are true, and the fact that they were good-for-nothings caused more damage than exploits when mentioning that he can't stand them.

The thing is, both cousins may be incredibly, astonishingly, rudely <em>blunt</em>. Superman judges a baby contest and a mother asks what he thinks of her little darlings? He tells: "Frankly, this is the worst collection of misbehaved brats I've ever seen! And you tried to flatter me, dressing your babies like me, hoping I'd pick them as winners!" When Lois censures his bluntness he retorts he is not a hypocrite. Supergirl's fan club gives Kara a lunch and the girls ask how she liked the food? She tells: "Er... You meant well, kids But frankly, the salad tasted like moldy hay, and the chicken wasn't fried... It was burned!" When the poor girls cry, Supergirl protests: "But, girls... You asked for the truth... and you got it!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Chick Tracts</a></em>, the protagonists do not shy away from telling others that they'll go to hell if they don't convert, or that the recently deceased unsaved (including good people or those close to the listener) <em>have</em> gone to hell.
<ul><li> In "The Slugger" (as well as "The Superstar"), the main character's gardener isn't shy about telling him that he thinks he's nothing without Christ in his life, earning him a rebuke. When the athlete finds out he's dying of cancer and asks his gardener if he's going to hell, the gardener says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluntYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluntYes">Yes... but you don't have to</a>," and recalls the time a "real friend" had the guts to tell him the same thing. The athlete accepts and bequeaths his fortune to his gardener.
</li><li> Similarly, in "The Star," Daisy, a cleaning woman, tells Douglas Ford that she thinks his films are "dirty" and that she won't see them, that he's a sinner who's on his way to hell, and that Cardinal Rooney, who says otherwise, is just a sycophant after his money. Like in the previous case, the actor converts.
</li><li> In "Somebody Goofed," an old man takes a similar approach when talking to a boy about an overdose victim, but this time, it turns out to not be the best idea. A man who turns out to be the Devil in disguise mocks his harsh stance and offers a more moderate alternative, thereby causing the boy to reject the old man's pitch.
</li><li> In "Wounded Children," David, having struggled with his sexuality all his life, is bluntly told that while Jesus can save him and forgive his sins, he'll also have to give up on being gay.
</li><li> A comic spoofing the Chick Tracts has Jack Chick having died and coming face to face with God, who is not impressed with him.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Jack:</strong> But, God! I've spent all my life kissing Your ass! <br/><strong>God:</strong> If I had meant for you to kiss My ass, I would have given you lips (<em>spreads arms all the way out</em>) this big!

And note that it's not just that people don't lie, they don't even have a <em>concept</em> of it. Taken to the ultimate extreme in that not only do they have no concept of lying, they have no concept of withholding the truth. Many times a character would not have had to lie simply by not saying anything but this doesn't seem to be an option either. Apparently this also means never using tact, as a character invariably blurts out the worst possible answer to anything.

</li><li> Ser Davos Seaworth, a common smuggler raised above his station that's so loyal to his king that he makes a point of avoiding the ass-kissing behavior others display. His boss appreciates this so much he's repeatedly <em>promoted</em> for it without asking, as his advice gets more valued than any of the other advisors.
</li><li> Stannis Baratheon, Davos's boss, seems incapable of sparing anyone's feelings even if he <em>tries</em>. His most heartwarming gestures <em>still</em> crash into the recipients with unpleasant truths attached.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister is also adept at using this for his own purposes. Especially noticeable in his treatment of Jon Snow, who incidentally is one of the few people Tyrion calls 'friend'. One of the things he likes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Bronn is the latter's lack of pretension, and tendency to be completely open about what he thinks of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.

He explains this by saying that if he said he ate Corn Flakes for breakfast when in fact he had Cheerios, he would be thinking about something that hadn't happened; but then he'd think of other things that hadn't happened, for example, that there hadn't been a scuba diver at the table, or an elephant, and so on, and would get so wrapped up in thinking about what didn't happen that he'd forget the lie he'd told in the first place. It goes so far that he considers <em>anything</em> that didn't really happen a lie, even fiction (the one exception is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> novels, which he enjoys). It's not just lying, either - he can't pick up on social cues, so he doesn't know what's appropriate to say and what isn't, and so has to be told not to say that one of his classmates is so stupid he would eat pound notes, coins, and his own poop.

</li><li> Rickard Karstark to Robb in "Dark Wings, Dark Words":
<div class="indent"><strong>Rickard:</strong> "I can believe until it snows in Dorne; it don't change the fact we've got half the men. [...] I think you lost this war the day you married her."
</div></li><li> This is one of Bronn's most endearing qualities, such as his blunt demand for a raise after his latest promotion: "I'm a knight now; knights cost double." After meeting him, Jaime is so surprised by the treatment that he has to ask Bronn if he talks to Tyrion in that way, too.
</li><li> Mance Rayder claims he managed to unite the wildlings because he told them the truth: that they will <em>all</em> die if they don't get south.

</li><li> Lord Yohn Royce doesn't mince words about Robin Arryn's skill at arms in "The Wars to Come".

</li><li> The Smalljon inherited his father's mouth for sure. He calls Roose Bolton a cunt, repeatedly, to his son's face and openly admits that he knows Ramsay killed Roose.
</li><li> Lyanna Mormont is not one for softening her words or the reality of the situation when Jon and Sansa visit her to ask her house's help against the Boltons. The Starks didn't come to reminisce, they came for her soldiers, no point wasting time chatting. Jon's an illegitimate son while Sansa's been married twice, making neither a legal Stark. And if they want her to send what little men she has into yet another battle for the Starks, then they had best give her a damn good reason. She's honest about herself, too: when Sansa tries to compliment her by saying that she'll grow up to be a great beauty, Lyanna responds: "I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty."
</li><li> Robett Glover doesn't hide his bitterness about Robb's mistakes.
</li><li> Some of the things the Hound says to Sansa about her situation are very blunt, but they're not <em>wrong</em> either, and are even good advice in the sense that he was urging her not to have any naïve illusions. For example, when he says he's a good killer and she's upset, he accurately points out that both her father and brother Robb are soldiers and both killed men too, whatever reasons they had for it.
</li><li> Tyrion doesn't hesitate to speak his mind when he thinks the situation calls for it. This often gains him respect for his earnestness but also lands him in problems from time to time when his abrupt input is not appreciated. Daenerys, however, appreciates his honesty, which results in her initially taking him on as her advisor, and then ultimately, her Hand (a position in which brutal honesty is required).
</li><li> Euron Greyjoy makes no bones about having committed regicide <em>and</em> Kinslaying. Oddly enough, he calculates the situation so that this works to his favor: the sheer audacity at admitting this makes him win the Iron Islands to his side.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Euron Greyjoy:</strong> I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

</li><li> He goes on to prove that friends should say that their plays suck by <em>challenging</em> them to come over to <em>his</em> play and still maintain their tactful lies. His play consists of saying "moist" over and over for an <em>hour</em> (Lily <em>hates</em> that word), followed by half an hour of discharging a squirt gun in Lily's face. After that came the epic saga of a singing, dancing robot that falls in love with a toaster. It was so monstrously bad that Marshall used the second slap he won in the slap bet to put an end to it.

Then she asks what their favorite part is and they all make something up, except Barney, who repeats that he's never seen it. Finally:

Hence Loker's tendency to say whatever comes to his mind from moment to moment, or to blurt out things like "I'd like to sleep with you" upon meeting Torres for the first time.

</li><li> In one episode, Jerry convinces George to do the opposite of whatever his instincts tell him to do ("If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right").

<div class="indent"><strong>Tommy Carcetti:</strong> Hey there, Jim. Tom Carcetti here, remember me? We met at your sister's house you know, the one that's married to that Republican cunt. I know you don't remember me. I know you don't have any use for fucking politicians, and frankly, I don't give a flying fuck about what you think or what your concerns are. But I do care about what your cute little blonde wife thinks about so many things. But, Jim, the reason I'm calling is because I want you to write me out a check for $4,000, the maximum allowed by law. Because we don't trust you to actually mail that check, we're gonna send over a couple of furloughed DPW workers to beat the check out of you.

<ul><li> Reimu Hakurei is, quite simply, a very honest person. To such an extent, in fact, that the option of lying often never even occurs to her. In addition to this, she also treats everyone the same, be they humans, saints, youkai or gods; with vague disrespect. As a result, she'll bluntly and unabashedly say exactly what she thinks no matter who she's talking to or what the situation may be, and only a rudimentary sense of social etiquette, her responsibility and duties as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNatureReserve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNatureReserve">Gensoukyou's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">warden</a> and the fact that she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">Slave to PR</a> occasionally makes her opt to keep her mouth shut.
</li><li> Marisa Kirisame, being Reimu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a>, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">unabashed mythomaniac</a>, but whenever she's not lying, she's, in fact, <em>even more</em> outspoken in her honesty than Reimu is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to ZUN himself</a>, this makes Marisa a very bothersome character to write for since her lack of concern for common social etiquette and readiness to just plain say things outright makes her very "un-Touhou like."
</li><li> Suika Ibuki is an oni, a race that hates lies and is known to do nasty things to liars. As such, <em>she</em> won't lie to you. No matter how harsh the truth is going to be. This makes some of her conversations rather... vicious. Doesn't help she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">drunk off her ass</a> at all times.

<ul><li> Ike himself as well, though more out of lack of social skills initially. He really is never one to mince his words, whether it be sarcastically bursting someone's bubble, or telling off the senators of Benignon out loud in front of all of them to hear.

You have the choice of doing this to Yukiko on her social link, but she responds better to encouragement.
<ul><li> When a guy confesses to Ai, she bluntly shoots him down and says that he's not good-looking enough for her, and justifies her response by saying that there's no point in getting his hopes up, simply because she's convinced herself that looks are all that matter (having invested so much of her self-worth in her beauty). If, however, you tell her that's "downright cruel," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust">you reverse the social link</a>.

Other Witchers, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Lambert</a>, often display this too.

In his ransom demand to the mayor, Scarecrow threatens to expose everyone else in the city to his gas as well, which, as Batman points out to Robin, means everyone in Gotham will be just as brutally honest as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool">that former employee</a> of his.

For example, when he gets invited to a dinner party by Kaeloo, the first thing he does is criticize the dining room's decor. He also tends to tell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">Stumpy</a> to his face that he's ugly, stupid, and/or a loser.

AJ doesn't understand why everypony's so upset because to her, it's "just" fashion, but then Rarity introduces her to a pony who not only doesn't like apples but tells AJ to her face that she considers them vile.
